2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent has had access. At issue is the status quo for the child. The petitioner is paying interim child support of $193 per month and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and reasonable telephone access. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support the conclusion that both parties are loving parents to their child and that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The applicants applied for solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff 'C' to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day on October 18, and half day in October. The application consumed 1 full day, and the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m. The court calculated that the matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required a significant amount of effort to prepare for, conduct the hearing and to review the evidence to be able to provide briefs to the court post hearing."

The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000.00 contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief (s. 430(4) (a)) were his offences. He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the theft charge. He appealed his sentence on the grounds it was unfair and the sentence was too long. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the errors in law law, that the sentence imposed was unfair."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assault with a weapon contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary to S. 88. The accused claimed that the accused struck him in self-defence. Absent consideration of defence evidence, the Crown evidence clearly establishes a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck and thereby applied force to the accused causing him to suffer wounds. The Court was unable to conclude that the Court could have expected the accused to have thought that he was facing an imminent attack when the accused stepped toward the advancing defendant and that the knife would have been sufficient to strike him if he retreated fully from the property. In light of the differences in age and size, the preceding verbal exchanges and the clear challenge presented to the defendant's authority to direct the defendant to stay off his property, the accused's gesture could only reasonably have been seen as warning to come no further and to leave."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages for damages arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff had leased a vehicle from the defendant, Christian Ruhr, pursuant to a standard lease agreement. After the accident, the plaintiff took the vehicle to Saskatchewan Government Insurance for repairs. During the repairs, damage to the vehicle's exhaust system was assessed. SGI deducted from the replacement cost, 20% for depreciation or 'betterment'. The claim was adjourned for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. HELD: An express election is not necessary. If the insurer wishes to reinstate, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. In this case, SGI elected to repair the vehicle under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.  1)An express election does not constitute an election. 2)SGI is not liable beyond the lesser of the actual cash value of the vehicle before the accident (with proper deduction for depreciation) and the maximum value of its exhaust system as fixed by regulations. The Court would be reluctant to hold that an insurer exercised an election by conduct unless it was satisfied it had all the necessary information to decide which of the two courses was more advantageous to him. The roving appraiser appraised the damage, provided an appraisal which included the deductionfor depreciation for depreciation and advised the plaintiff that there was damage which was not previously ascertained. Thereafter, Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. The father resides with his father in Alberta. Each of the parties and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Calgary. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city.  2) The father is currently residing in an apartment in Calgary. His wife Patricia lives in Moose Jaw and is presently taking upgrading classes at SIAST. G. K. is presently residing in a duplex located near the nearest school. He plans to have his family move to Calgary in the summer so that Hayley can commence school in the same locale as he attended. It is beyond his present financial ability to afford a home. 3) There is no other evidence before the Court as to the actual location of the residence. The residence is two and one-half blocks from the school. The parents live in separate apartments. One of them recently moved from Moose Jaw to Alberta. The other tenant in their apartment is also experiencing some problems. 4) The mother and father are experiencing some difficulties with regard to daycare, babysitting, school attendance and whether or not the father can exercise access. The mother is experiencing some anxiety and stress. Her anxiety is caused by the fact that she is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder. She is unable to sleep at night due to a series of back and forth appointments with her husband. Unable to access the mother's apartment for the past two years, she is having to seek the assistance of the Nova Scotia courts. She cannot afford to move with her current husband. 5) The Court was unable to determine how much time and effort it would take for the mother to return to her original residence."

The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support.

HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and to supply the respondent with reasonable telephone access for the supervised access visits. The limited access proposal by the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, who the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent did not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits but had she applied for variation in terms of the order before she left. The August 2002 order of Koch J. was vacated. The court was of the view that the respondent will not again disobey court orders so that fine is not called for in the circumstances. A fine would be appropriate."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner counter-petitioned in 1992 for interim maintenance. The respondent granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month and child support of $800 and $400 for the maintenance of the two children. An application by the husband to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J.on May 11, 1993. It is apt to proceed first with division of property.

2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff certified organic farmer sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant and that the quality requirements of the contract had been met. There was nothing in the contract with Wlaswich that allowed the plaintiff to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party.  2) The documents submitted by the defendant purportedly copies of the German documentation were not admitted into evidence.  3) The issue is of little relevance in coming to the final conclusion. 4) The plaintiff has satisfied his contractual obligations and is entitled to pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from the 26th day of September 2006 until the date of judgment."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted, by a jury, of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each party has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions to proceed to Step 2 of the verification process. The Administrative Judge found that both parties agreed that there was a need for one comprehensive database for the purpose of verifying the applicants' fees and disbursements. The applicant applies to have leave denied. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verificationprocess along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. MLG did not err by requiring the applicant to pay the disputed account of a non-party relating to matters wholly unconnected to the action. The administrative judge made no error in finding that the number of people who retained the applicant could not be reconciled with the redacted electronic billing records. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by the applicant are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will consider them. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings."

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month.

He applied to vary the maintenance order even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material; the court erred in allowing the application to proceed even though the father had failed to provide full disclosure of income documentation and of his alleged medical problems. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support and to cancel arrears be heard absent that party making full disclosure.

The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.,"FIAT.

The respondent was seeking to lapse the caveats and served notices to lapse on the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. 1)The Caveator did not have an interest in establishing the agreement for sale. Further documentation was required by a trial judge in determining the issue of thevalidity of Home's interest in the leases involved, including the matter of whether Home's lease violates the rule against perpetuities. 2)There may be a number of circumstances in applications under s.159 where established agreements are not in issue. Home Oil failed to produce all necessary documents.  3)The question here is whether it is the caveator or the challenger that should be required to initiate an action. Home argues that Home is the successor in interest to the subject agreements, exhibiting at the same time all of the certificates of title, the caveats, and all the leases underlying the caveats. Where there is an agreement in existence, the burden of establishing it is on the party attacking the agreement to establish that it was not in force. Home's application for further relief was dismissed as there was not a clear and prima facie case for allowing the caveats to continue. 4)The respondent should commence an action to declare the leases void."

The Chambers judge also accepted the respondent's submission that the extent of the immunity of administrative boards and their members from actions such as this based on their alleged malice and bad faith is, as yet, unclear in Canada. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The broader issue involves consideration of the immunity of the Labour Relations Board, and its members, from actions based on their alleged malice and bad faith. The appeal is allowed in part, per reasons for judgement of Pugsley, J.A., Hallett and Freeman, JJ.A. The issues on appeal are whether the Chambers judge applied a Wrong Principle of Law, in that the issue of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear in law, and the desirability of maintaining supervisory jurisdiction over administrative tribunals by superior courts appeared to be an open question in Canadian law. The issue of Crown immunity in this case was not plain and obvious. It was more akin to statutory defence to an action than an action."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children claimed that the accused had given him money to buy cattle. When the accused hung up the phone, the accused became so angry and his voice was so loud that he woke the baby granddaughter sleeping in the next room. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. HELD: The accused was found guilty of uttering the threat. The Court held that there was no need for the accused to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. It was always open to the Accused to make Corbett applications and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In a non-jury trial, the Court should look charily at admitting such convictions or giving them any probative weight whatever. There is no need to draw a prima facie inference from the criminal record during a trial such as this one."

Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were found not guilty of any of the offences listed in the charges. 2) There was no evidence that the defendants, who were the owners of the buildings and land bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, intended to subdivide for residential purposes or that they had any intention of allowing anyone to use their property on a public reserve. Rather, they took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the provincial government was the titleholder. 3) The Municipality stepped into that position. It could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply in law to public reserves. In some cases, the municipality had refused to comply with the by-laws governing the use of the reserve. In others, it had refused or refused to permit anyone's use on the reserve, even if it was within the range of permitted uses. 4) There were a number of complaints made to the provincial department of planning and development (the Department of Municipal Affairs, the province's agency representing the landowner government for that land and the municipality's enforcer of Sec. 197) but no charges were laid. 5) The actual wording of the charges was: 'on or about the 30th day of June 1992 at the resort village, the defendant was the owner/operator of a boathouse.' 6) The defendant's claim that he was entitled to a share of the profits from the sale of his boat and that he could treat the reserve as if it were an extension of his own property was not supported by the evidence. 7) The respondent's claim for costs was dismissed. 8) The municipality did not seek to prosecute anyone for the actions of the defendant. Nine months later the municipality became title holder."

The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.",The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court answered the question as to the causation of the plaintiffs injuries.  1)The Court was of the view that the injuries sustained were those of an injury causation mechanism and not the consequence of the collision. 2)The court was not prepared to accept the opinions of the defendants as it did not consider their qualifications as an expert in the field of biomechanics. 3)The pain and discomfort experienced by the plaintiff relate to pre-existing injuries and to two mishaps that pre-date the collision Dr. Dust was not called to testify.
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter, and that evidence obtained should be excluded. At issue was whether the Information To Obtain Search Warrant (ITO) was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO, the applicability of the rules established in R. v. Vu, and the wording of the warrant itself. HELD: The application of the Court was voir dire and the search of the accused's computer was held. The court found that given the detail of the items to be searched for, the omission of cellular phones was intended, and such a background search of suspect is not an unreasonable step in an investigation. The seizure of the cellular phone did not appear covered by the search. A ban on publication of evidence that may disclose the identity of a person under the age of 16 years of age has been imposed in this case.  1) The Court could not take judicial notice of the capabilities of a cellular phone generally, and guess whether this particular one would be within the broad description of a device capable of storing images or other relevant data. It was never suggested that relevant material was found on this cellular telephone. 2) There was no evidence obtained as a result of the search as there was no breach of the provisions of s. 8(b)(iv) and (v) (v). 3) Of the 15 pictures that were found in a Toshiba Satellite laptop computer, one was found to be of interest to the Court as it was a model of lingerie and other brief clothing. One of the pictures was also found on a laptop computer owned by the father of the child, related to police through the father and related to a social worker.  4) It is of significance that no prescriptive evidence could have been obtained by reason of the alleged denial of rights, which is of significant significance in this instance because there is sufficient context to allow the justice to assess the information judicially and to determine the appropriate remedy if a breach is established.  5) The court allowed a conclusion that the court could not, in the form presented, support the issue of a warrant by a justice acting judiciously or in the manner capable of being determined on its merits in this hearing."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. His father's intention to name him as beneficiary was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants are chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sells life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd. The plaintiff purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for a lump sum premium of $60, naming Garry Mayer as its beneficiary. When the annuity matured in 1994, it was withdrawn by the plaintiff and deposited in his own bank. He shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of his son to March 31, 1996 for his costs to be taxed and his costs of the probate fees paid by the estate. The claim against Nordstrom is dismissed. Given that the defendant was named as a defendant, no evidence was led against it and the claim against it was dismissed. Consequently the 'disappointed beneficiary' principle is equally applicable in this case involving financial planner and his client. Although the plaintiff held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff's mind. His failure to take these steps and his inexplicable compliance with the Mayer's request to designate beneficiary regardless of its efficacy did not reflect the standard of conduct and care one is reasonably entitled to expect of a professional."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order.

The petitioner is working part-time and living at home with the children. Luke is 18 and attending university. He decided not to go to university that fall. He commenced full-time studies at the University of Regina in September. He continues to work part time. HELD: 1)The Table amount of support for children based upon the respondent's income would be $1,153 per month. It would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for support of Luke during the months of September to December. 2)The children were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. The Court of Appeal in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 89 (C.A.). 3)Both Luke and Amanda are children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They are involved in their reasonable pursuing of post -secondary education. 4)The Court found that the respondent misapplied s.3(2)(a) of the Guidelines by failing to resort to the provisions of s. 3(2(b). 5)The petitioner's income was $3,330 in 1999, $4,050 in 2000 and $18,000 in 2001. He received $5,000 per annum in student loans. He is able to cover most of their direct education expense through student loans and earns approximately $475 per month from his part time employment. He also has a line of credit which he can draw upon. In the circumstances at hand, it is appropriate to have the respondent pay the Table amount for both children and his proportionate share of post-'secondary expenses not covered by student loans.' 6)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it was not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency and to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and children who are in similar circumstances. It is the Court's position that the cost of maintaining the home for the children (and the petitioner's children) must exceed the generous ambit of support"
d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford to individuals in our society and the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The young persons, JP and JR, now in Grade 9, were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them. The assaults and related proceedings have already generated strong emotions on all sides. The plaintiffs have been the subject of negative comments on the social networking site Facebook. Based on my education and experience, I believe that further publicity of the allegations made by the children can only serve to aggravate the controversy and detract from the education and well-being of the student body as a whole. HELD: The order of the Court is set out by Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., [1994] S.C.C.; R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76 (2001 S1R 442) to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects of the rights and interests of the parties and public, including, the right to free expression. Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavit will not cause further harm to them in the view of the court. The public, in particular fellow students of the youth, have the right of know their version of the facts. However, other portions of affidavits which speak to the effect of the assault on the 2 young persons and ramifications to others should be sealed since there is a real and serious risk of further harm. J. G. M. KRAUS, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is cognizant of the fact that it is already possible to alienate, stigmatize and alienate young people from their sense of self-integration and acceptance into society."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt.

The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The present case is one of those situations where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque, where payment does not satisfy just debt. The defendant had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The plaintiff had already received payment for their services. The default judgment against the defendant was taken out January 13, 1997. Relief is sought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a) which provide for a declaration that the plaintiff has no cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment and that the defendants are entitled to insist that it can only be held accountable to innocent third parties or in circumstances where the payee has acted to its detriment. In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of a payee is maintained while providing recourse to bank where payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified one."
1991canlii2445.txt,"This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of the Investment Dealers Association following findings by a disciplinary panel that the appellant had broken rules by which the investment dealers' profession regulates itself. The appellant alleged that the panel acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging Ripley with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. The charges involved disclosure of information about federal cabinet minister; permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades in securities not approved by his head office); failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; failing to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Ripley was found guilty of three breaches of a by-law which established a disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct which is unbecoming of a professional. Dismissing the appeal with costs of the judgment, that there was no error of law on the appellant's part in finding the Charter had no application in the present case."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.",The plaintiffs brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 222 and 232 for an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories; an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the defendant on issues arising from his responses to the written questions; and an order directing him to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs. The second application was also adjourned sine die. The judge was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination. He would be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the plaintiff.
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The first access issue was for the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second was for child support purposes. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The schedule as detailed by the court was unchanged. The court granted leave to bring the matter before the Court on three days' notice. 2) There was no evidence that there had been any change in any circumstances which would warrant an increased access order. The petitioner was entitled to take the children for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August. It was reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased.  3) The access provisions in the February 2007 fiat were meant only to cover the gap between the application and pre-trial. The request to specify access this summer was not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) There is at least one type of case of breach of contract where the arguments in favour of punitive damages are compelling. This is the case where the defendant breaches the contract deliberately, and refuses or fails to tender compensation known to be owing to the plaintiff. That position is untenable. The obligations created in this case are by SMI to the first defendants, the holders of the policy that provides coverage for the claim, and are not absolute obligations giving rise to an automatic claim for consequential damages in the event of any failure to make timely payment in accordance with the policy. 2) In every insurance contract an insurer has an implied obligation to deal with the claims of its insureds and is entitled to a duty in tort, distinct from its implied contractual covenant. 3) In this case, however, the plaintiffs were not entitled to any damages for the loss of their crop as a result of the defendant's breach of the contract. Rather, they were entitled to costs in the amount of $20,000 per claim. 4) The plaintiffs rely heavily on Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co., 2002 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 595. The Supreme Court of Canada dealt primarily with the question of the appropriateness of the award and amount of punitive damage. It is common ground that the application in question would have far reaching effects for the insurance industry. The risk of being found liable for consequential damage resulting from unsuccessfully contesting a claim under a policy would constitute a substantial disincentive for insurers to deny claims, even those which they reasonably and in good faith consider to be either unfounded or inflated. 5) Each of the acts specified in the above referenced acts would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation, which would not advance the law or the public interest."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Motor Vehicle Act when she knocked on the door of her neighbour's residence to obtain a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all counts. The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and there was little if any evidence to support the charge. However, the Court of Appeal concluded that if a trial judge finds on all of the evidence a police officer knocked on a door for the purpose of securing evidence for a crime, the breach undermines the interest protected by the Charter. Here the unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and 9 affected the accused's privacy, liberty, and human dignity. She was in her own home. The police officer's accompanying her around the home and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant' The Court also concluded that the Vanwick case was a good law and the leading case on Section challenges. Although it was different in that the police officer went to the house because there was a continuing offence and she was concerned that someone was driving around with a young child in the backseat, she did not ask the officer in and as the Court noted that police officers often accompany vehicles around the house to obtain evidence. The Court concluded that this breach was serious and that it affected the lives of the occupants."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them. Specific dates and times should be set aside for the plaintiff to call evidence with respect to its claims against each applicant group. The applicants should be relieved from attending the trial at any other time.","FIAT: The Sims, Gabriel and the Dumurs bring separate motions, pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 41(a) for severance of the claims against them or for orders staying the claims until the plaintiffs' claims against the Walbaum Group have been decided.  1) The plaintiffs are equal partners in Dun-Rite Plumbing. The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, after the application of Morrison, the company was liquidated. Thereafter, the main defendant in the action was Dwayne Walbaum. He diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies and his wife. The plaintiffs claim that the other defendants were involved in the divestiture of assets by Walbaum and that they were required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four trials. 2) Although counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that the evidence against all of the defendants can be adduced, there are very few days that the applicants can adduce evidence against one, two or all three of the applicants. It will be left to the trial judge (or the pre-trial management judge) to designate specific days on which the plaintiffs may call evidence and argument presented with respect to each claim.  3) The defendants are entitled to severance if they elect to do so. Specific dates for calling evidence in respect of each claim will be designated by counsel for each plaintiff. 4) The plaintiff has suffered pecuniary losses of approximately $15,000. As a result of the aforementioned breach of contract and failure to pay by Gabriel, the plaintiff has lost approximately $20,000 in pecunia losses. 5) The defendant will be relieved from attending any portion of the trial on any other date without leave of the Court. The plaintiff will not be required to attend portions of that trial in any event. severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  6) The applicants make the following submissions: (a) the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to the defendant's dealings with each applicant or required to divide the evidence in such a way that it would cause undue prejudice to the applicants; (b) given the likelihood that the applicant will require at least one day to participate in certain portions of trial, that there will be relatively little time to call evidence at least once per week for three or more days; and (c) there is a reasonable basis for concluding that the trial of the issue or issues sought to be severed will put an end to"
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and concluded that the August 1992 incident amounted to a culminating incident. HELD: 1)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was not patently unreasonable. 2)The parole evidence rule precludes the receipt of oral evidence offered for the purpose of adding to, varying or qualifying in any manner the terms of the written document. With respect, the clause would have read 'dismissal'. 3)The respondent's statement to the grievor of its intention was admissible for the purposes of supporting its argument that termination was the appropriate penalty, given the fact that he was warned this could occur. 4)The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months."

August 7, 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agreed that the applicant should continue to pay child support of $150 per month and $1,250 per month for as long as the child was child within the meaning of the Divorce Act.

This is based upon his knowledge of the retirement regulations for persons serving in the Canadian military. He nevertheless agreed by the provisions of that Order to continue to make child support payments to support his daughter so long as she remained a child in the provisions for which she may be eligible as required by the Order.  2)The applicant had no income and she suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions.

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants was without merit. Application granted; although the time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act, the court found that it did not have that long a history as there had been open, notorious and continuous possession by the vendors and purchasers since before the time of the present possessory ownership."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the evidence concerning attempts which had been made to control the offender's behaviour in the community and the failure of an expert who testified to consider this when he gave his opinion. The matter was adjourned to permit an examination by an expert chosen by the defence. HELD: The Court held that it would be preferable to have the accused found a long-term offender because the evidence showed that the accused could manage to reduce the threat to an acceptable level by means of community supervision, including the prescribed conditions to which community supervision is subject and the additional conditions that may be imposed by the Parole Board. A review of the applicable law at the outset was held to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of the accused eventually being controlled by the community, given that there were significant amendments to Part XXIV in 1997 which have been interpreted by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Court of Appeal, and given the unusual nature of this sentencing procedure. The Court also considered R. v. Lemaigre, which dealt with the issue of whether there was a reasonable prospect of change in the course of life for the accused even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender. The accused would have been thirty-two years old at the time of the offence, had he been released from custody, and would have completed his probation term within two years."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Regulations. The parties are on common ground that in the 1990s, Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. However, disputes arose between the applicant and the plaintiff regarding the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies and to the Interpretation of the various types of priority agreements. The applicant contends that TD is entitled to refuse to restock direct ship parts. The issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for. The central issue is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were'specially ordered' by TD. HELD: 1) TD's priority claim is based on the first two sentences in paragraph 4.2. TD contends that the priority does not extend to parts or credit for parts and that there is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. 2) There is no dispute that TD and CNH Canada agree that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the agreement. 3) There are no facts in dispute as to the identity of the parties concerned. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the applicant to refuse the restocking of direct ship part. The critical issue is that the distinction from inventory and credit paid for and inventory andredits financed by the NHCC to Wheatland is irrelevant. The essential intent of the contracting parties is to determine priority between competing claimants.

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. An application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children. The father had been employed at the Esterhazy potash mine on a full-time basis since May 1997. The preceding years were not significant because the father's current employment at the mine commenced in 1997. HELD: 1)The father's 1998 farm income was determined as being $27,600. The Table amount for two children on a gross annual income of $24,370 is $347 per. 2)The most reliable indicator of true income is the 1998 year because of the significantly higher amount he earned. Income should be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime. The acquisition of equipment and the claiming of capital cost disallowance in these circumstances in lieu of renting equipment was not patently unreasonable. 3)The costs of the step-child's pet were refused. 4)The court was not prepared to consider a deduction for child support."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s.23 of the Act and s.35(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. The children are identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: 1)Each child is in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). As the first option set out in s. 37, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The current plan proposed by the agency is appropriate in these circumstances. 2)The Agency has chosen to designate each child as a person of sufficient Interest. The Agency will provide personal service to each child within 15 days of receipt of the order. 3)It is important that the children continue to have sense of security in their placement and continuity in their lives, both of which they will have if they remain in their current placement. Each child would be in all likelihood remain where they were on a temporary basis; better that they have the added stability of the 2012 order being sought than a lesser order."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The application before the Court is pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. A review of the case law reveals that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive support and that it is now'res judicata' within the Court. 2) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders retroactively. There are no provisions that indicate how that discretion is to be exercised. 3) There are a number of factors that may mitigate for or against retroactive child support. A preliminary matter was filed with the Court on February 25, 2005 and it was clear from the written decision that he did not deal with the issue and in fact contemplated that the issue would be dealt with by further application."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and possession of stolen property. He applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that the accused was breathing rapidly and that his 'carotid artery' was 'pulsating' and he was concerned that the driver might have been drinking. The officers observed fresh black caulking around various external panels and at the front corners of the motor home. 2) During the course of the search the police officer observed an older motor home travelling in an easterly direction weave from the centre line over the fog line approximately six times. The plate appeared to be relatively old, but the rivets securing the plate to the dashboard were shiny and the area around the VIN plate was clean. The VIN number on the dash was different from the one on the registration and the registration plates were different. 3) The motor home had been extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. Although the police cars being driven by both officers were equipped with windshield view video cameras and audio recording devices, neither of them activated that equipment. The police officer testified that he did not use his video camera because it caused his vehicle to short out. He asked the accused if he was on any medication and when he last used any liquor or narcotics. The accused replied that he had used liquor the week previous and narcotics a long time ago. The officer then proceeded to drill through the wood panel under the mattress but was unable to do so and pried the panel off. Underneath it they found stainless steel plate and under that black duffel bags containing bricks of cocaine. These were the contents of two plastic bags containing $2,000 worth of marijuana. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags and two bundles of $20 bills totalling $3,080 were found in a cupboard. While the police officers were monitoring the vehicle for signs of impairment or smell of alcohol, they noticed that the panel from the rear axle to the back had been painted in a very soft fabric.

Counsel for the applicant took the position that the limitation period could be waived pursuant to s.30 of the Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and that a minimum of 120 days having elapsed between the factual basis for one claim and the earliest the new claim could be brought makes it difficult to say they arose out of the same occurrence or transaction.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.","The appellants appealed a Summary Conviction Appeal Court decision ordering a new trial on seven counts against them under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act and (failing) to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. 1) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the Trial Judge. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus the Trial judge properly considered the issues of income before dealing with mens rea. 2) The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary or this Court. 3) The Crown appealed to the Summary and then this Court, in response to the Crown's argument the retruns were false and the records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes, stated 'It is also consistent with simple sloppiness'. There is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment of taxes, or whether there was any intent to make a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy. Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 (SK CA), [1982] W.W.R. 249. The Court must determine whether a taxpayer's rights, including the right to be free from a charge of tax evasion, are violated by a trial judge in failing to report the returns of income to the Court. It must be clear from the evidence involved that the tax assessor was prepared to make an undisputed and undisputable charge."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.",The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: 1) The children were apprehended from their mother S.D. (the'mother'). The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including one expert witness. The expert testified that S.T. was involved in a relationship with another woman and that the mother was hostile to the Ministry's workers and sometimes threatened to sue them for negligence. The child had severe lice and was exposed to domestic violence and disharmony. 3) The mother was found to have significant physical and mental disabilities and had significant hearing loss and had bone conduction hearing aids which she wore as a headband. The physical disability of the children was severe and could not be cured by surgery. The hearing aids were not replaced nor were the hearing aids worn. 4) The child was placed in the custody of the minister until she attained the age of 21 years. 5) The evidence from the child protection worker was considered by the court as an appropriate case to make an order respecting each child pursuant to the Act.

That the inherent rights of the parties to attend the discovery should not be displaced by the mere assertion that 'the lines of questioning of each of the plaintiff grandchildren will be virtually identical'. There is no evidence before this court that this would be of value to the grandchildren plaintiffs in being able to access the examination evidence of another witness."
7_1995canlii6153.txt,"The Plaintiff sued her stepfather for damages for sexual assault. He had previously been convicted of a criminal charge based upon the same incident. He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The plaintiff commenced an action against A., claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. A. did not defend the action. The plaintiff alleged that A. sexually assaulted her and forced her to perform sexual acts on him. The defendant plead guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting. He was sentenced to a term of ten months imprisonment subsequently reduced on appeal to six months. HELD: 1)The functional approach should be utilized assessing the compensation required to provide the injured person with reasonable solace for his misfortune. In most personal injury cases the loss to the plaintiff is caused by the negligence of the defendant. An award of aggravated damages is therefore rarely even considered. But when the claim is founded on a sexual assault, the damage inflicted is deliberate. The damage inflicted by A. must be fully encompassed by the non-pecuniary loss. 2)The psychological trauma and emotional distress that the plaintiff has undergone have been severe. She will continue to suffer to the same extent for an appreciable period of time. 3)The Court determined that the non pecuniary losses encompassed the loss of self esteem, self esteem and amenities of life must be encompassed equally. Thus, the aggravated damage award must be reduced by 20% to $40,000. 4)Because the plaintiff's loss was already assessed as severe and there was likelihood that it may be chronic, she was entitled to an award toward the upper limit of the established range. However, if treatment should be available, it would likely be a prolonged process and may ultimately be of limited success."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court applied the principles in McKenzie to the accused's credibility, while not necessarily believing the accused am left in reasonable doubt by it, that there is a presumption against strict liability offences and in favour of some element of mens rea or criminal intent. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. She started an action against the defendants, the owner of the Aubrecht vehicle and the insurer of the Paris insurance policy. The insurance company refused to pay the plaintiff $140 per week for monies paid on the basis of misrepresentation and unprovable assertions. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant forced her to 'alter her position to her detriment' by continuing to accept the money. The defendant argued that the plaintiff failed to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of the benefits until after the commencement of the litigation, thereby causing the defendant toalter its position to its detriment. The court found that the defendants had acted expeditiously to comply with their contractual obligation on the grounds of the representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the plaintiff from getting its money back. As the plaintiff was not employed at the time of the accident, she was not entitled to any benefit under Schedule 'B'. The plaintiff's claim against the insurance company was not supported by the plaintiff's employment record. There were too many contradictions in her testimony, which was contradictory to her position on the employment issue."
d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, is a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of a conviction for child abuse. Although the mother is more connected to the child and has taken more interest in the long term care, she is more financially stable. Both parties were very uncooperative with the agency and it was clear neither was willing to work with assistance towards learning sufficient parenting skills to take care of the child. HELD: 1) Considering all the evidence before the court, including the two plans of care, there is a bond between the maternal and child. She would facilitate access and protect the child from her own son whose access must always be supervised. 2) The mother is better set up in her home to receive the child (age, health, death) than she is in the maternal grandparents' home. The maternal grandmother indicated she would have to move to a larger residence if she got custody. Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent the child without there being sufficient risks to their health and well-being. It is due to this that the Court makes the sole recommendation that the child be placed in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, R.S., who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties. This is a statutory requirement and the burden of establishing an alternative to parental placement is squarely on the proponent.  3) The child is in need of protective services. The mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. The father, V.M., who lives in the city with his mother, lives with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area and would take the child there as he should beraised with her brother. The paternal grandmother is a pediatrician. The child's mother lives in a two bedroom apartment in Halifax, but would get a larger one if the child were placed in her care. 4) Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, this reality may be quite difficult to discern; all the more reason to expect the individual who volunteers to serve as an alternative family placement, be obliged to demonstrate that the proposed plan is workable, well motivated and worthy of serious consideration."
3_1999canlii2586.txt,"One of the residual legatees of the respondent estate filed a petition under s. 31(1) of the Probate Act. At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant had practised law for in excess of forty years before retirement. He had made a number of specific bequests, including one to her niece and a bequest of $10,000 to the Zion Lutheran Church. Dorothy Crouse, widow of Lunenburg, appointed the appellant sole executor of her estate. She died in September 1997. At her request, the Acting Registrar of Probate ordered all estate money be paid into an estate bank account. Counsel for the two respondents sought costs on this appeal on a solicitor and client scale. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to be paid forthwith by the appellant as well as to the respondent.  1)The appeal was relevant to consider the matters that gave rise to the appeal. The appellant's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which we would class as unconscionable. Those actions go beyond what we might term as merely reprehensible. The grounds of appeal are without merit, indeed, without any modicum of merit. 2)The appellant's acknowledged actions constituted a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor. These actions constituted sufficient justification for his removal as president of the estate.  3)Solicitor and client costs were left to the court on the matter of the determination of the appellant."

The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings. It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact.

The landlord's ground of appeal is that the hearing officer was wrong in her decision on the facts. In essence, the landlord asserts the Hearing officer did not find the facts as he suggested that he should have. HELD: The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction. This function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal. Only when there is no relevant supporting evidence is the line between valid and invalid appealable finding crossed. The Landlord's appeal relates to the landlord's finding of facts related to the tenant’s claim for reimbursement of one-half of the utilities.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was on salary, was unhappy about being asked to work less hours by her doctor and one of the reasons she was dismissed was because she was not able to qualify for special benefits due to her not having 600 hours of insurable employment. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for the special benefits from Service Canada, the issue of damages between the defendant and the plaintiff may be decided as a result of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. 2) There is actually no loan given to the defendant. There is no record of it, as far as loan documentation goes. The accounting records do not show it as a repayment of the advance as testified to by the plaintiff; since the defendant is a corporation the defendant had no obligation to record accurate working hours in the plaintiff's Record of Employment for her.  3) The plaintiff could have obtained the payments that she had lost if she had been unable to obtain payment from service Canada. It would be simple matter for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to the plaintiffs. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply a gift to assist the defendants to start their life in Canada. The plaintiff as well could have verbal loan with the defendants.  4) The defendant claims back $2,400 from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. John testified that he had been in business in Canada for 35 years, and infer that he would be well aware of the benefit of written document for any loans. This misunderstanding does not affect the fact that once she was dismissal by the defendant, the plaintiff had an obligation to document accurate hours in her Record of employment for Lilia.  5) The payback of the loan, as set out in the Statement of Claim at $500 per month, was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. It is unclear as to why loan was to be made and then 7 days later the first payment would be taken out. There was no explanation why monthly amounts of $400 and $500 were not taken from both defendants, as this would"
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. As the child of a previous relationship had been unemployed for several months, the court could not establish that her standard of living was below that of the child from another relationship. If neither child was able-bodied and in good health, it would not be reasonable to impute income. 3) The father's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. The court must determine whether he obtained employment and/or a contract with the provincial government and, if so, his remuneration from that position. There is no suggestion or evidence that the child is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The father has three other children, aged 13, 15 and 16 years of age, respectively. The parties' financial situation do not warrant such a finding. 4) The application involves claims pursuant to s. 7(1)(a)(d) and (f) of the Guidelines which read as follows: 10(2) Based on the evidence, the father's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. The child has been pursuing secondary education and was engaged in that pursuit at the time that he was born. The mother has been actively seeking employment since the beginning of her career. Given his health, his education, skills and physical limitations, he can't establish that his pursuit of education was unreasonable."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (Reg. 10)'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. The appeal was allowed and the conviction declared void because the charge did not charge an offence known to law. The Certificate of offence, form of the Summary Offences Procedure Regulations, 1991, permits the issuer to designate a particular type of vehicle or regulation which is alleged to have been breached. The registration of the vehicle is issued by the Traffic Safety Court. The certificate of offence provided a voluntary payment of $105. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared for the appellant on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte, and trial was held. The police tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The traffic justice commented that the appellant had been in apparent violation of the tinted window prohibition for over 3 years. The officer issued a certificate of offense. A 'good faith' agent was sent on his behalf to appear at that date on the pleadings to address the sufficiency of s. 275(2)(c) of the Crown and Crown's argument that the charge was so defective that it was a nullity. HELD: Appeal allowed and conviction quashed. 1)The Court found that the portion of the sentence which was imposed exceeded the original fine by 333% plus surcharge. 2)It was not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect.  3)The count cannot be amended so that it is nullity because it is an error of law. 4)It would be impossible for the accused to allege an offence of operating a vehicle with after-market tinted windows because the Crown had not provided a proper number of elements to allege a violation. It is prohibition, without the creation of an offence or imposition of penalty, to revert to the extreme technicality of the old procedure"
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The fact it was not specifically spelled out in the judgment is not fatal. Recognition of a discount for tax on RRSPs was explicit in the wife's position in her pre-trial calculations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter. The wife having laid out discounted values, one would expect that the husband would have demanded explicit language if he wanted to use unreduced RRSP values to satisfy the Equalization payment. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense in all the circumstances. This is irrelevant in light of the taxable nature of the RRSP funds. 2) The wife's application was directed to the Court of Appeal. The Court ordered that the amount transferred should be increased by a factor of 1.3. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order."

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Hartford sought to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not responsible for carrying out the fire loss. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that the insurer was not obliged to contribute. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. An appeal on the principal issue of compound interest was dismissed. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire had caused the fire nor that there was a contractual obligation between the insurer and the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or Fraser Brace for causing the loss. In summary, there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. The Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. In this case it never did. On these facts Guardian had no obligation to respond to under the terms of the policy issued to Delta."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The RCMP officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates and noticed that one of the pockets of the accused was bulging and he asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. The officer told the accused that once he had arrested the accused, he could perform a search incidental to the arrest. The accused said that this was his practice to ask persons suspected of bringing in an over quantity of alcohol to relinquish the same in which event the person would not be charged. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all charges. 1)The Court was satisfied that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had consented to the search. However, it was not satisfied that there were any exigent circumstances upon which he could have obtained a warrant. Further, the Court raised the following issues relating to the conduct of the authorities, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982: 1)Was the accused detained in an arbitrary detention contrary to s.10(b) of the Charter; 2)If the question 'where are you going' was innocuous social conversation, that it had nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance. The question 'what is in the back of the van' had no effect. The Court questioned whether the officer pulled the van up to the rental van in an investigative mode; 3)Had the accused been detained and asked to participate in the seizure of evidence; 4)Had he been properly informed of the expungement of the evidence by the arresting officer; 5)Had it been necessary to expend time and effort trying to locate the evidence in order to arrest the accused; 6)Whether the officer was properly advised of the impungement or whether the search was unreasonable. Counsel argued the officer must provide the accused with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel without delay. There were no officers in the RCMP detachment that day. In Young, supra, the police officer questioned the accused about a block from business premises which had been broken into. The court recognized there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Crown acknowledged there was no argument advanced that Cst. McLaughlin, as officer, was acting in a manner that interfered with the lawful authority of the RCMP to detain an individual.

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded in a 1998 judgment. The defendant applied to strike the plaintiff's claim, saying s.102 of the Act precludes an action for damages as a result of the intentional inflicting of harm on a victim by use of motor vehicle, “then it is an actionable tort to beat someone up in Saskatchewan with a baseball bat but not so if the assailant uses an automobile”. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of the act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault because of the way he treated her. She also alleged that he touched her inappropriately and that she no longer felt the same way about him. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken. It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The first was for failing to file returns for a business held on behalf of a person who was not represented by counsel. The second offence was for failure to file GST returns. Although the appellants had filed returns in accordance with s. 326 of the Act, the court found that the returns were not filed and the request for a return was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the behalf of the Minister. The court refused to consider that s. 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code."

The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate Statement of Defence of Helen Rilkoff. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The issues raised do not appear susceptible of being simply resolved, and certainly not on a summary basis, and neither did the issues in the defence and defence of the defence show a reasonable cause of action. 2)The Court had referred to statutory provisions, and judicial decisions in support of their respective positions as to the validity of the bylaws of the plaintiffs allegedly entitling the plaintiffs to claim interest on unpaid unpaid assessments and solicitor/client costs.  3)Statutes, judicial decisions, and Judicial decisions did not support the claim that the issues raised in the statements of defence or in the counterclaim were mere resolutions authorizing the plaintiffs not to recover interest and solicitor's costs. 4)Both parties referred to a judgment of this Court, which dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants had asserted that their damages arose in 1994 and were a different cause than those for arrears of a mortgage loan.  5)It was asserted that the issue raised did not arise in 1994 or from any other cause, and that the defence offered by the defendants did not disclose a reasonable defence.  6)Solicitor/client fees were not deducted."

The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)The Court was satisfied that there was no question that the case had generated significant pre-trial publicity. However, it was also satisfied that a properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. 2)The application was denied.

At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old appellant pled guilty in Provincial Court to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. He sought leave to appeal and appeals from his sentence of nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. An eight year probation order had been imposed.

His driving record consisted of two convictions for possession of a narcotic, two for theft under $1,000 and one for driving prohibition for a period of 3 years. He consented to a three-year driving prohibition and was prohibited from driving for three years.

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period.

The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code.

The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 3)If indeed the judge had found that under s.(213) the Actus Reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect."

During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence.

Pshyk. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in the original document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to made mention that the accused's speech was slurred. The police did not refer to the Checksheet in their re-direct examination of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this trial, I am satisfied that the actual prejudice was suffered by the accused on a balance of probabilities. His rights under s. 7 were infringed."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appealed the decision of the Chambers judge dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. Appeal dismissed; the jurisdiction to hear the appeal of this appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss. 7 and 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and on the basis that the Court has jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case as well as in the context of that case. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There can be no assumption that an appeal will yield a more accurate result than the original proceeding. If the same result is reached in the subsequent proceeding, the relitigation will prove to be a waste of judicial resources, an unnecessary expense for the parties and possibly an additional hardship for some witnesses. 2) There is no evidence that this Court will be inclined to hear this appeal because it is an interlocutory appeal from decision which is part of an application under SCAN."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed.

She now seeks an order of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. In so doing, she suggests that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply. 2) This is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount requested. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spOUSal rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband.

HELD: The order of severance sought by the plaintiff was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial.  1)The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by the counsel for the Canada government if the issues are severed are groundless. 2)It was in the best interests of justice to have the order granted so the issue could proceed only from the litigation of the issues with respect to the third parties. 3)The plaintiff was stung by the delay in the pursuit of resolving the issues.

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal set aside; conviction entered on the charge of common assault. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent did not have the minimal intent required for the offence of assault. He mischaracterised the assault as being an assault. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the Crown must prove an accused applied force intentionally in connection with a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess a minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence. This minimal intent requires that an accused perform conscious as opposed to accidental or unconscious acts. There will rarely be a case in which the evidence will support finding that self-induced intoxication caused an accused to be in a so-called state of automatism that would lead to a finding of reasonable doubt as to the intent required to prove general intent."

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a maximum contact principle which alone provides a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting.  2) The evidentiary record as controverted as it is, is not lacking to the point where the judge had no proper basis for her decision. In Lumberjack v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 SKCA 137, the Court of Appeal was at liberty to interfere. 3) The chambers judge made minor changes to the custody arrangement to accommodate the sharing of school holidays and to allow the children to spend meaningful time with the father on Tuesday evenings. Her treatment of the issue did not mean that she then dismissed the issue as irrelevant. Rather, she assessed this principle in the context of the children's best interests."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","A bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in 1996. The trustee of the estate never applied for discharge. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)The nonexempt equity did not exist at the time of the application for discharge and the caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that any increase in the equity will accrue to the benefit of the creditors.  2)The respondent did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act and pursuant to the Trustee Bankrupt's exemption, the trustee was transmitting an 82% interest in the real property to the trustee’s name. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant homestead.  3)The Zelmak, supra judgment is distinguishable from this case because the trustee there was not. That argument supposes that it is appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration proceedings for a trustee to withhold timely application for discharged and await market enhancement of the value of non- exempt equity in homestead property. However, the Court of Appeal set out minimum requirements for trustee to meet when dealing with non- exemptions in bankrupt's homestead and a requirement that the report of the trustee on the bankrupts application for a discharge can be attached by the trustee. In this case, the applicant is at the date of her bankruptcy and registered as owner of residential property in the City of Saskatoon having an exemption in the amount of $32,000. The Trustee would distribute the $50,000, nonexempt income to the creditors without any obligation to maintain or administer the home in the intervening years. 4)The applicant is entitled to her exemption from taxation if it is warranted. She remains vested in the authority vested in her by the province to make recommendations to the court on the discharge of her property pursuant to ss.172(b)(3) and (f)8(g). 5)The trustee is empowered to make a discretionary order restoring her assets subject to the provisions of the Act and to make an order for disbursements to the applicant upon her request.  6)This is an issue that will be tried by the applicant for discharge on an application by the trustees for discharge in accordance with s.207 of the Saskatchewan Bankrupt Act. The applicant is also entitled to leave her interest in property acquired after a discharge in the name of her husband, who is a bankrupt.  7)The order"
c_2007skqb355.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: 1) The purpose of the examination for discovery is to determine the relevance of certain undertakings. Undertaking and the defendant's response are to provide specific references to the provisions in the contracts that are considered ambiguous in terms of the question of whether there is a separate contract for the sale of taxable personal property. 2) The third parties are obligated to provide the plaintiff with a detailed list of documents in their control so that he can be further examined on the responses.  3) Examinations for discovery have been held by all parties. The plaintiff seeks judgment against the defendant for the amount paid. 4) The broad relevance test applies to matters of discovery where it appears that their relevance may well be resolved by other evidence not before the court on the application. In this case, the three parties allege that the third parties collected and remitted provincial sales tax (PST) in respect of cement supplied and used by third parties in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendants as a third party claimant and specifically deny that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against them. 5) The application for an order requiring the third party to provide a complete response to any undertakings made pursuant to s. 5(1), (2) and (6) of the former The Education and Health Tax Act (the 'Act') will be addressed one at a time. 6) The Court will support any legislative framework which clarifies these relationships for Saskatchewan PST in a manner consistent with the findings of the above-mentioned court cases. 7) The three parties have disclosed certain PSAC documents relating to the Saskatchewan PST issue but have not disclosed the other documents. It has been agreed that if such answers are ordered they will be provided in written form with leave to the plaintiff to reconvene examinations as may be necessary. Such an undertaking would violate the 'broad relevance test' which requires a party to answer all questions asked on discovery that are relevant to the matters in issue. 8) The portions of the pleadings and proceedings relating to discovery are of particular importance to the cause of this application. Further, the parties have indicated that they will continue to bill the contracts"
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action against the three doctors was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting the existence of a trust or a relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The arrangement was entirely voluntary. The plaintiff was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it. On the facts, the hospital tolerated the plan and to that extent only co-operated with the doctors in its implementation because when it operated well it delivered to the hospital.  2)The common characteristics defining a fiducary relationship were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood, 1992 CanLII 8313. 3)Crouse and Kirsch were medical doctors. Hanna was president of the Moosomin Family Clinic which he owned, and Crouse and Krouse were family doctors. Both practised family medicine in the community. They also operated a clinic independent from the clinic. Neither practised medicine on a rotation basis. The proposed system was completely voluntary. One doctor could join or not join. The other doctor was required to respond to hospital's calls relating to emergencies.  3)HELD: There can be no question that this action was completely necessary in the interest of providing good patient care to the city and that such a relationship is necessary under the bylaws governing the city. There was no breach giving rise to an action for damages. 4)The plaintiff's exclusion was of course authored by his own conduct. The administrator of the hospital and chief executive officer for the clinic tolerated the arrangement but to a lesser extent cooperated with its doctors in the implementation because they were paid by the hospital for the services they provided and the patients were entitled to their privileges. The court found no breach of any kind. 5)The court dismissed the plaintiff's action against Kirsch with costs."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time was an inmate. The police officer testified that he had asked the doctor if he could take the blood from the accused and he had seen the accused walking out of the vehicle with his left leg pinned by the steering wheel. The doctor testified at trial that he did not recall if the officer said 'ok, that's okay'. HELD: The Court held that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. 1)The Court was satisfied that the medical practitioner had reasonable, probable grounds to believe that the taking of the blood samples would not endanger his life or health. 2)The evidence was found to support the conclusion that the accused would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered his life if the Certificate of Analysis had been issued. 3)There was no evidence as to whether the officer had signed the second certificate as required by s.258(1)(h)(supra.) of the Code or whether the doctor had obtained information from the Physician so that he could be Confident and Advise the Accused that the Taking of the Blood Sample Would Not Endanger the Life of Him. The Court was not satisfied that either the doctor's signature or the official character of the person appearing to have signed it was sufficient to conclude that the Certificate was not a valid proof of the facts as determined by the Court as whole. 4)Had the Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the blood was either taken personally or under the Supervision of a Medical Practitioner (II) the Court was left with reasonable doubt as to who actually took the blood or if the accused was capable of acting in that capacity."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, the accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel who advised him that the officer had not made forthwith an ASD demand and that his s. 10(b) Charter rights had been infringed. The accused sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith and the accused was not subjected to the unnecessary delay. The admission of the certificate ofalyses would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court found that the accused's s. 9 Charter rights were not infringed and that he had the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure (ASD) as protected rights.  1) It was the Court's view that the Charter breaches were moderately serious and the delay was of a relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel. 2) The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. 3) The accused had no right to consult counsel prior to making the demand. There was nothing to indicate he could not have made the demand, even though the device itself was not yet present at the time of the detention. 4) There is no rule with respect to the exact number of minutes which must elapse before the demand falls outside the 'forthwith' requirement. Each case is dependent upon its circumstances. Following the R. v. Rilling analysis, the Court held that the delay of 11 minutes can be attributed largely to waiting for the ASD to arrive. The officers knowing the accused had not reached either of their office numbers, took no steps to provide the accused with their after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. 5) The Court was unable to find that the Court was unaware of the existence of an ASD. 6) It is not fair to confine the Charter rights of an accused to simply waiting for a breath sample to arrive at the station and then to demand it be made. The certificate of analysis is admitted in evidence."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant plead not guilty to driving a motor vehicle while suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. At trial, the Crown called one witness, a Halifax police officer, who testified that he was the appellant's son. The appellant argued that the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses, his son and three other witnesses. He appealed his conviction. Appeal allowed; conviction stayed; it would be impractical to order a new trial at this date and order a verdict of acquittal.

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other.

On the count of aggravated assault, the Court sentenced him to three years imprisonment. On count of breach of the peace, the accused was given credit for five blows to the face while the officer was on the scene.

The defendants counterclaimed for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. At pretrial conference it became clear that there were two issues involving an application by the plaintiff to add or substitute another plaintiff and to seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. The first issue was whether the plaintiff had a valid reason for the lengthy delay. HELD: The plaintiff's application was dismissed. 1)The delay was a full nine years after the cause of action arose. 2)There was no evidence that the plaintiff sought or received legal advice during this time as there is no disability other than that alluded to in the letter of 30 October 1992. 3)The plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for some nine years.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.",FIAT.

The order also required that a report from the said psychiatrist be filed with the Court. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application was simply another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency and that a certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to s38.3 of the Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed.

The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants and third parties. The defendants appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench in Englund, reversing a trial decision, ordering a conditional stay of the action. The applicants applied to the Court to stay the action permanently or on an interim basis, arguing that the Court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. Application dismissed; virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are now properly and conditionally required to be considered by the Court during the certification application of the plaintiff's claim. The Court acknowledges that the phenomenon of overlapping and parallel class actions commenced in different jurisdictions has become increasingly significant. There is now an active national debate as to how the difficulties posed by such proceedings might best be addressed. However, this appeal does not require the court to engage in an exploration of the general approach which Saskatchewan courts should take in the face of typical overlapping multi-jurisdictional class actions. There will sometimes be entirely valid reasons for such an approach."

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent also sought custody and child support. The petitioner sought to have custody of the three children in the petitioner's care and joint custody with the children, with the respondent having primary care and control of the children and himself having liberal access. HELD: The petitioner's request to have the respondent postpone the child care expenses be granted was not made in good faith and there was a substantial differential with a new mortgage that would be required to provide a new home for the children.  1)The respondent was living common law. His common law spouse works outside the home as caregiver for elderly people. The Court was not provided with any written estimates of the expenditure. 2)The child support payments were to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $4,000 per year for the next three years. The payments would have to be met by a mortgage of $100,000. 3)The eldest child was attending university and the parties had agreed to joint custody of their youngest child. The youngest child would be attending university when he is 21 years of age. The eldest child is attending university. The two youngest children have been members of the cubs since before the separation. The parties' relationship has been strained and the children no longer have the opportunity to play with their own toys. The oldest child is working and living in a mobile home with his parents. This should not interfere with the mother's reasonable access with reasonable notice. 4)There was no change in the formula for child support calculated by the Court for the purposes of calculating the appropriate level of special and extraordinary expenses based on the federal Child Support Guidelines."

If the matter had been raised at trial and the judge then thought that the evidence not disclosed impacted the accused's defence, he could have adjourned the trial. 2)The evidence not disclosed would not have affected the accused's defence in any event. 3)On the issue of reasonable doubt, the trial judge could reasonably have convicted on the evidence, and the Court would therefore not substitute its own view of the evidence.","The appellant sought to overturn a conviction by the Provincial Court that he operated a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol and/or drugs contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code.

It should have been raised. 2)Even if one could find merit in counsel's argument, which the defence did not, and even if it was accepted, the trial judge could reasonably convict on the other evidence heidered. 3)The right of the Appeal Court to set aside a conviction on the evidence is set out in s. 613(1)(a)(i) namely that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.

The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the Bank as custodian of the property of the bankrupt and claimed to be a creditor of that bankrupt. The Bank opposed the application. At issue was whether counsel for both the Bank and Trustee should be in a position to influence the direction of the Bank in its dealings with the bankrupt estate and whether it should seek independent legal advice on the matter. Counsel for the Bank declined to comment. Application dismissed.  1)A clear distinction must be drawn between the duties and obligations of a receiver-manager appointed under the terms of a debenture and one appointed by a court. In the former case, the trustee becomes an officer of the court and acts in a fiduciary capacity to all parties involved in the litigation. 2)The Trustee was to retain independent counsel. 3)The conduct and conduct of the trustees was to be determined by the court. 4)The trustees were to receive full particulars of the claim. 5)The applicant was to present his evidence to the inspectors. 6)The court was to consider the history of the trustee's relationship with the opposing party and its role in the estate administration."

At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act.

Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant.

2_2011nssc338.txt,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","The applicant landlord appealed a Small Claims Court adjudicator's decision to not grant declaratory relief. The applicant sought to have the adjudicator sitting on an appeal of a Director of Residential Tenancies decision hear his application for a review of rental increase. The adjudicator did not have the jurisdiction to hear the application and the applicant brought an application for Pure Declaratory Relief. The small claims court granted the application. The issue was whether the applicant's affidavit was properly before the Court and whether it should be considered on the merits of the appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Small Claims court declined to entertain the appeal and referred the matter back to the same adjudicator. 1)The adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small claims Court had jurisdiction to hearing the application of the applicant. The decision was not final but it was not the same as an appeal to the Supreme Court which relies on the record from the court below.  2)The Small Claims Act provides an appeal as right to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on a matter involving a rental increase pursuant to s.14 of the Act. In this case, the applicant feared that he might be precluded from launching an appeal because of the statutory limitation of 30 days. This is simply a ruling given during the course of hearing. It is not a final order or determination made by the small claims adjudicator, but rather a re-hearing of the dispute between the parties.  3)With regard to the affidavit, clearly the small Claims Court Act appeal provisions do not provide for the submission of any new evidence. The appeal is not hearing de novo and in this case is not yet re-trial. Reference should be made to the ruling on the preliminary motion by the applicant on the interlocutory appeal of the director of residential tenancies order, although the decision is still open to be entertained. The solicitor general appealed the decision. He requested that the matter be referred back for a continuation before the same small Claims court adjudicator who made the interim ruling.

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

Costs in the cause were to be divided between the parties. 1)The fundamental tension in the evidence is on the issue of misrepresentation. The subtleties involved in making the distinction between factually and legally as to whether plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation cannot be resolved in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to ss. 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA warrant applications with respect to the baby do not provide an indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish the adult male is the natural father of the girl and the baby and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother of the baby are'strangers' genetically speaking. The probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, but the crucial determination will be whether the dad and mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics. The DNA of the child would then provide further confirmation or negation of the relationship. HELD: A DNA warrant application would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised that it is so advised. The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding. There is nothing in s.485(1)(b) which can reasonably be said to suggest that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestual relationship, which sample is not in the possession of the Crown and which remains in the child's body, is a bodily substance. The proper inference to be drawn from the words of s.476.05(1) is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or carried by the victim at the time of the offence is found at or obtained in conjunction with a crime scene or at any place associated with the commission of an offence. In this case, the natural mother was not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the blood. While it may be appropriate at some point to order that the baby's blood sample be obtained notwithstanding any parental non-consent, it is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order.

e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant made an effort to have the decision reversed, arguing that the Board of Governors exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective agreement. In his view, the decision brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The reasons as a whole support the decision. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 1) The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. 2) The board of arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. With respect to the formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the professor's academic freedom, which is an abuse of authority and is harassing and intimidating actions against the professor. These actions by the federal government and its Board have interfered with the academic liberty of this faculty member, in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005). This issue was clearly joined by the University's student grievance.  2) Before passing upon the merits of the application, it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the board of arbitration. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union, 2004 SCC 23 (CanLII), the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment in Bethany Pioneer Village, 2006 SKQB 370 (Haskell), it was the respondent who suggested that his dispute with Dr. Stonechild should affect the opportunity for the professor to appear at the symposium to present his research, but not in the context of the union's grievance. 3) The respondent's suggestion that he should be removed from the speakers' list did not comply with the requirements of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Collective Agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the collective Agreement occurred while the respondent was acting in his capacity as Chair of the University’s board of Governors and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the matter within the jurisdiction of the Board."

The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The petitioner received information that he was not served with the applicant's application and supporting material for a telephone conference.

The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank. The Bank's application is brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The Court finds that the Bank's priority is to the leased equipment subject to the Lease. The lease was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the bank's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the bank."
d_2000nsca75.txt,"Respondent obtained ex parte recovery order. Appellant applied for the return of the property under Rules 48.06 and Rule 48.08. Its application was dismissed and the appellant appealed that order. Appeal dismissed. The affidavit material filed by the appellant in support of its application was so defective as to be not admissible. The affidavits contained substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue. Some portions of the affidavits dealt with the subject matter of the main action which are not to be resolved on an interlocutory application. The offending material so pervaded the affidavit that it could not be edited out.","The appellant, carrying on business under the name Atlantic Business Systems, applied to the Supreme Court for an interlocutory recovery order. That order was issued ex parte by the Prothonotary pursuant to Rule 48.01. The appellant also applied for security for costs. Dismissing the application, that pursuant to rules 48.06(1) and 48.08(2) of the Code, any party or intervenor in a proceeding may apply for an Interlocutory order to recover possession of property that was unlawfully taken or is unlawfully detained from him by any other party, or is held by an officer under any legal process issued in the proceeding. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to making an application in the context of a discretionary one such as this one, including the right to cross-examine the applicant on the merits. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago, the mother unilaterally moved with the children from Nokomis to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. That move was reversed in January 2012, and that issue was adjourned pending the receipt of the custody/access report. HELD: 1) The mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. 2) Even on an interim basis the court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's best interests. This is not a balancing act; rather, it is a fresh consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the needs of the children, and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. There was nothing suggesting that the children would be deprived of the benefits of living together in one household with both their parents. This defies common sense. 3) The children's access to their father while he is incarcerated was limited by the fact that he was charged with a number of criminal matters in the fall of 2012. When the father was sentenced in October, he was eligible for early release in December 2013. 4) There was no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour while he was incarcerated."

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the decision of the Commission was quickly made, did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented, and was patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty.HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court adopts the third ground of appeal. The appeal incorporates the relevant issues set out in s. 22 of the Real Estate Trading Act (RETA) and the fourth grounds. It is the Court's view that there are only three standards of review and that reasonableness should not lead a reviewing court infer bad faith or that no legally valid reasons existed. The standard of review is one of correctness. While adequacy depends upon the context and there may be no precise single test of adequacy, reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.

e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license, granted by the Province of Nova Scotia, which allowed the sale of liquor on the premises. The club was located in an area which was subject to the respondent's Land Use By-laws. A development agreement was entered whereby the permitted uses for the club consisted of pool tables, beer, wine and spirits, a bar and lounge and allowed the use of members of the club only and no advertising of the availability of liquor service. The application was allowed on the basis that the change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would constitute a change in use requiring a development permit. HELD: The applicant's application was granted. It was unnecessary to consider the ramifications or results of a possible change of non-conforming use. 1)The applicant had not established a club. It had been a private pool hall for many years. It is common ground that this operation was conforming to the use bylaw as it then existed. The fact that the applicant had constructed a lounge license does not change the fact that this lounge license would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The establishment would be subject to a development agreement. 2)Both remoteness and neighbourhood effects play a role in the proper disposition of this type of case. Reasonable existing uses came to be protected under the concept of 'acquired rights' both under the Civil code in Quebec and by judicial interpretation in the common law provinces. The development agreement would therefore be required as that is a new use, and one that is significantly different from its former use as a private swimming hall. There is no 'decision' of the development officer which may be appealed to the Board. This is a sound principle that the Legislature could not have contemplated an interference with vested rights, unless the language used clearly required some other construction to be given to the enactment. The use of premises as a store is a distinct change from use of the premises as store. Lawfully existing uses such as furniture and furniture stores, furniture and building material and supplies dealers, nursery and garden centres, food and beverage stores and miscellaneous store retailers (with the exception of manufactured home dealers) will be considered by development agreement only. 3)Discretionary land use rights and the right of a person to have his/her own property taken into account in making their own decisions"
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to issue an order requiring the receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. Also, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any agreement for Sale within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v). Counsel for the appellant gave the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court. The respondent was ordered to pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs.Leave to appeal was allowed. The appeal would be allowed and an order of the Court to issue directing return of the goods or payment of their value. The appellant would seek the order in the amount of $15,000. The judge held that once ITI decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. He found that ITI had selected the books in issue and therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject, pursuant to its contract with its students, to provide at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program. It follows that such changes may be made during the course of the student's program."

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and for inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate claims against the plaintiffs based on alleged actions by the plaintiff. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, was advanced by the plaintiffs against the defendant and contained indirect quotes attributed to the plaintiff and appeared to be material to the defendants' defence of the action. The second cause of action, inducement of a non-party, was brought against the applicant. HELD: The Court granted the application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 7-9 regarding the pleadings and the rest of the statement of claim. The Court found that the defendants’ pleadings to be immaterial and in no way relevant to the issue of wrongful dismissal or any resulting moral damages were warranted. The pleadings were not intended to be part of the plaintiff’s defence of his claim and were merely mere pleadings. They were merely documents to be considered by the court and would not prejudice the parties in any way as they were not statements of defence. Further, the statements of media outlets were treated as if they were actual statements by the defendants and were not mere allegations."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The parties were married in 1976 and ceased living together around the end of 2001. After the separation, the child continued to live with his mother. In October 2007, the mother made an application under the Maintenance and Custody Act seeking retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. She sought an order that would provide: parenting provisions as to their son; child maintenance payable in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that the order would be retroactive to the date of their separation. The parties' income had increased since the separation and the mother had made overtures to the father for increased child maintenance. He resisted such requests indicating lack of income; he did, on numerous occasions, increase his monthly payment; the evidence did not support conclusion that the mother was pressured or intimidated by the father to the extent it would be reason for her to delay her application to seek formalized child support. The father had 'effective notice' that his current payment was deficient."

The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.

He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated at the second knuckle. The Court assessed the plaintiff's damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities of life at $10,000. It found that the non-pecuniary damage issue was resolved satisfactorily. The plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. The claim for loss of income, past and future was assessed at $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest.

The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The landlord appealed a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond to the claims and evidence of the tenants, failing to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought or the nature of argument they intended to advance. The hearing officer accepted the tenant's argument that the move was a nightmare and expense due to short notice and that the plumbers did not correct the problem, so left the breakfront and dining room furniture to one side of the room in order for access to be had. The tenant also argued that moving costs should be awarded in part to compensate for inconvenience and loss of useable space and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. HELD: The Court held that the decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of using of usable space and the loss of that space.

9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The issues are not in dispute. The trial judge found that the respondent authorized the sale of the mobile home and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. It was at this time that Lanson discovered that the mobile Home had been sold and attempted to seize it. The Credit Union resisted seizure and an application was brought before the Court of Queen's Bench to find priorities as between the parties. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Section 28 of the security agreement contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to deal with the secured debtor and that the buyer must know of the authorization. 2) The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. With respect to the facts, in our opinion, he was in error.  3) The issue is reduced to whether the security interest was granted pursuant to the terms of the agreement or the conduct of the respondent. The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave the lanson express authority to dealwith the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditors does not invalidate the sale to the purchaser. 4) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., which was restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to a secured party."

By the time the respondents entered into the subject mortgage on October 4, 1988 they were living in their home on the property. The respondent stated that he was working at construction work in Rosetown and was raising some chickens, turkeys and geese that he had acquired from his father. Offers from potential purchasers for the barn facility and the non-typical design of the dwelling may be impacting negatively on value. HELD: Application adjourned. There was no recent appraisal information available. If this time does not allow the respondents to resolve the debt, by sale of the property or refinancing, then the respondents shall have the onus on the return date of providing evidence why the upset price suggested by the applicant should not be included in an order for sale."

The parties married in 1981 and were divorced in 1990. The father was $1,713 in arrears until immediately prior to the matter being heard in chambers. He consented to $1,800 owing for 1997. HELD:1)The father was to pay $454 for child support for the two children who lived with the mother. His proportionate share of orthodontic expenses was 86% ($1,677) to be paid by five payments of $280. 2)The respondent's average income over 1994-96 for the purpose of determining child support was $32,243.39. The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years. Deducting all of the respondent's capital cost allowance was not a reasonable expense. An adverse inference was not drawn from the failure to produce the financial records of the respondent's farming partner. 3)The applicant's average income for 1994-96 for purposes of calculating the s7 expense was $5,278.40. 4)The father was to pay $1,800 prior to April 30/98 as payment under the 1990 order. 5)The father was ordered to produce the documents referred to in s21 to the applicant by May 1st each year. 6)The applicant was awarded solicitor/client costs of her application to determine the amount of outstanding maintenance owing for 1996 and 1997 and her taxable costs on the balance of the application.","The mother brought a motion for variation of child support pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. She also brought an application for an order fixing the amount owing under the previous child support order of Baynton J., dated September 5, 1990. Much of the evidence is disputed between the parties. Both counsel confirmed that they wished the issues resolved on the basis of affidavit evidence, without resorting to viva voce. HELD: 1)The affidavit evidence was not sufficient nor substantiated sufficiently to determine income. 2)The respondent was to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the applicant pursuant to s.19 in each of the above years. 3)The applicant had appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she deducted portion of her home and vehicle expenses. The average of these three years of income was $32,243.39. The mother's taxable costs were $7,226.20, $5,606.82 and $3,002.20. The reasonableness of an expenses deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the Income Tax Act."
9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing and thereby interfering with the plaintiff's lawful use of the premises and with its contracts with its own subcontractor and suppliers. The defendants granted an order abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action. The injunction was granted on the basis of the following grounds: 1) that the picketing was lawful in the sense it was merely peaceful picketing for the purpose of communicating information; 2) that there was no question that picketing took place at the entrance to the premises adjacent to the pollution control plant and that those trucks had been delayed by the presence of a picket line; and 3) that in some cases the picketers had taken photographs of vehicles attempting to enter and exit the site and had used baseball bats to the effect that they were trying to intimidate and frighten the occupants of those vehicles. The plaintiff had already had two loads of concrete waiting at or near the construction site for its concrete finisher employees who were prevented from entering the site for approximately 1.5 hours. The picketers were also obstructing the entrances of other vehicles to the site. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendants were ordered to pay costs. 2)The plaintiff was ordered to file materials disputing the allegations made in the motion. 3)The acts complained of were illegal and were unlawful and could not be justified merely because the defendants were engaged in a legal strike against another employer who had business relations with the employer being picketed.
5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused, a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The police had intercepted the stolen vehicle at the station and arrested the accused. The accused argued that the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and necessity to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs and was, therefore, incident to arrest. Accused found not guilty on all counts; the evidence was ruled admissible. Although the accused's claim that the police conducted a 'pat-down' search was not supported by the evidence, significant efforts were made to preserve the evidence and to prevent its disposal. The evidence was found to be relevant to the totality of the circumstances surrounding the arrest and was to form part of the trial proper."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rea and if the accused believed the activity had been consensual, he lacked the mens dea for sexual assault. The issues in this case are: 1) Did the complainant consent to having sex with her husband? 2) Did she have a subjective state of mind that raises reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consenting due to her level of intoxication? 3) The complainant testified that she did not see anything but blankets as it was dark in the room. She said that after she realized what was going on, she got into an argument with her father and told the complainant to leave. If not, did she have an honestly but mistaken believed in consent? 4) The evidence as to the subjective states of mind pertaining to consent was not reliable given her testimony that she had no recollection of the events due to a alcohol induced blackout. The evidence of the defence witnesses raised reasonable doubt as to whether the complainant had been incapable of consent. 5) The Court was satisfied there was insufficient evidence to consider whether the accused had an honest or mistaken belief as consent. Whether the complainant was able to communicate with her daughter as she was still not able to consent to sexual activity, and whether she had the cognitive capacity to communicate effectively with her own daughter, if she had not been able to do so due to intoxication, must not be considered."

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse took part in a separate action against the defendants after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The nurse advised against driving after having an abortion. The plaintiff also testified that she was concerned about the plaintiff's ability to drive home after having the abortion. Awarding $115,000 in damages, that the plaintiff was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The court found that this was a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if the patient was well enough to leave on her own. The plaintiffs' evidence on liability was admitted as follows: 1)It is not uncommon for a nurse to operate a vehicle after an abortion, but this nurse was not permitted to drive for any length of time after the procedure. She operated the 'MacPhail Vehicle' in an Easterly direction, in the direction of Halifax, towards exit 4. When it was known that she had no one to drive her home, the procedure should have been postponed to another date. 2)The female nurse was responsible for all nursing functions at the clinic. Her role was to provide counselling on the emotional issues involved with the abortion and to alert other health care professionals of the symptoms of the disease. She also provided evidence as to the nature and persistence of the effects of the drug in the patient's mind. 3)The plaintiff was awarded $55,000 as general damages for loss, injury and loss of control of the vehicle. 4)The Court found that there was a recognized risk that a patient would experience a delayed vasovagal reaction, which in this case was not the recognized risk."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents (defendants), the defendants, and the Village of Bjorkdale. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or them liable in negligence. 2) The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or contributed to by the respondents. 3) There was no tenable basis to interfere with the decision."

The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and wilfully failed to comply with a youth probation order by failing to attend a youth court function. The accused had served nine months pre-trial custody and was in La Ronge selling cocaine. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 40(3)(a), (b) or (c). The Court placed the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts. He was prohibited from possessing or consuming any controlled substances for the purpose of trafficking, except cocaine.

The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with the intent to rent and maintain suitable insurance.

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were in breach of the covenants of their lease as alleged with respect to the demised premises and to use and occupy a good husband like manner. The respondents admitted the payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a failure on the part of the tenants to maintain proper weed control. A writ of possess in accordance with Form C of the Act may issue with costs to the applicant in any event of the cause.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. HELD: 1)It was significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a material change in circumstances. The applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were.  2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material improvement in circumstances since the spousaling order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation pursuant to s15.2 of the Divorce Act, rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self-sufficiency, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It is evident that the applicant has retired and has no intention of becoming re-examined. 3)The parties had three children. The respondent understandably did not work during the marriage. Fortunately the matrimonial property division coupled with spousals provided her with sufficient financial means so that she was not required to seek employment after the parties separated. 4)The respondent was now over 65 years old and receiving Canada Pension and Old Age Security.

She suggested that he could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be reduced. Her costs were reduced by 15 percent when failed claims for punitive and exemplary damages were treated as separate causes. The medical report charge was not allowed. 2) Expert medical evidence was of marginal value to the Court. The court found that expert medical evidence should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 3) The expert's fees were not taxed or allowed. 4) Costs were in the discretion of the Court as well as the level of taxation applicable.

The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The RCMP had previously applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search, the RCMP observed movement inside the residence and noticed that the accused was in the entrance hallway. The police arrested the accused and found a suitcase containing $750,000.00 Canadian cash and some American cash in the shower of the main floor bathroom. The Crown contends that only if both warrants are found to be invalid is s. 24 of the Charter engaged. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the warrants, is nevertheless commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any s. 23(2) Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken. HELD: The Court held that both the search warrants were valid and that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of them. The Court found that the RCMP officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the C and DSA and that his endorsement of the Code was non-conscriptive within the meaning of R. v. Buhay, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), 1 S.C.R. 607. Accordingly, the admission would not render the trial unfair. It would be unfair to the trial judge to deprive the accused of his Charter rights."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused applied to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. Factual Background The accused was arrested and charged with sexual assault and a sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and further that he had committed sexual assault on his son while watching pornography on a computer and while touching his son's penis. The Crown alleged that the offences occurred at the accused's home when his wife, the complainant's mother, was at work. The accused appeared in court without counsel or an interpreter. The matter was adjourned for election to October 29, 2008. The application was dismissed. The test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the accused was not persuaded that his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation to which he plead guilty nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to it was not credible. The Court found that the accused had not fully understood that the allegation was part of his motivation for pleading guilty and that his understanding of it and the consequences of his plea did not change."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The primary issue on this appeal was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in a youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging that the same offences had occurred when he was an adult.(1) The Court considered the effects of the transition from the Juvenile Delinquents Act to the Young Offenders Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). It was common ground that youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to any offences which occurred prior to the date of their commission. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law.  1) There are a number of pre-requisites for a transfer hearing, including whether the accused should have assumed jurisdiction, the time of the alleged offences, the charges, and the appropriate forum.  2) The jurisdiction of the Youth Court is determined by s.5(1) of the Act. It does not depend on averments in the information or on proof of age. The focus of the hearing is not on guilt or innocence and at this stage of the proceedings the rules of evidence applicable to criminal proceedings are not strictly applied. The Court reviewed the various types of evidence and found that the accused could not be tried in either youth court or ordinary court due to the uncertainty as to when the alleged acts occurred. 3) The issues before the Youth court on transfer hearing are whether the Court adopted the concept of universal jurisdiction or whether it was the Court's responsibility to determine the proper jurisdiction for the charges. In this case, the primary issue is whether the judge was correct in declining jurisdiction on the basis he was unable to determine whether the alleged crimes occurred when they occurred. It would appear there are no adverse consequences from such an order. 4) The issue of whether a writ of mandamus should issue will of necessity follow the result of the determination of the first issue."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties were the parents of twins, born in August 2005. The petitioner went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. However, the petitioner has increased costs now that he has the children 50% of the time. The only change is the petitioner's income which has increased by $22,479. That in no way indicates a material change of circumstance. The court dismissed the application."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","An action for divorce based on separation. The issues were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of the matrimonial home and the division of property. HELD: 1)Access was to be reciprocal on alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening with the objective that the children be together with the same parent on most weekends. This was in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The test was whether division at the date of the petition would lead to an unfair and inequitable result so as to require compilation at a different date. 1)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as determined by the Pension Benefits Act.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of her spouse. Maintenance for the parties' two children, aged 5 and 6 years, was reviewed by the Court in the meantime on the ordinary ground of material change in circumstances.  3)Spousal support was reduced to $900 per month payable the first day of each month commencing December 31, 1999.  4)The parties had reached agreement on some of the issues and substantial agreement was made on others.  5)The court was not prepared to grant an order that required a time-limited award for an indefinite period.

2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had been living separate and apart for more than a year. The parties agreed to joint custody of their children and that the child support payments would remain in effect. The mother sought to vary the parenting time so that she and the father would equally share their time with the children. The father argued that the current arrangement was detrimental to the children's academic or social life. In his application for divorce, the mother indicated that she intended to remarry and relocate and sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend. She also sought a clause preventing the removal of the children from the general area and for the father to pay child support by paying a table amount in accordance with his income and by making a contribution of $100 to the child care cost. HELD: The current parenting arrangements have been in place for five years. The current arrangements are working and there is no evidence to support a conclusion that a change is necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship.  1)The father has been paying a party $800 per month since their separation to provide child care of their two children. This expense continues and is reasonable and necessary. It is also reasonable and in the childrens best interest that the children have access to both their parents during the Christmas, New Year's and Boxing Day holidays. 2)The parents agreed to share parenting time with their children. For the last five years, the children had been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. There had been no suggestion that this routine was harmful to them. There was no evidence presented to show that this current situation was harmful. 3)The parties had a shared custody arrangement for 5 years. They had, to a degree, a home base. Spousal support was ordered in the amount of $647 per month for the five year period ending June 1, 2006 with the exception of Remembrance Day when the children were in the care of one parent for an extended period of time."
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement which provided for shared parenting. The petitioner now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of their separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the petitioner's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a'shared parenting arrangement'. The petitioner argues (3) that the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding at the time it was entered. (4) The petitioner has been financing her education by managing spousa and child related government income and student loan income. She lives in the parties' former matrimonial home. HELD: The petitioner is entitled to withdraw his RRSPs, over $23,000, from his credit card balance and must continue to pay $2,000 per month as combined child/spousal support.  1) Section 17(3) of the Corollary Relief Act provides for a wide discretion to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in s. 17(7). The petitioner's application is dismissed. 2) There is no suggestion the parties didn't enter a 'binding agreement' or that they did not engage in binding agreement. Rather, the Court must take into account the totality of the parties’ circumstances and the fact that the petitioner has suffered a dramatic drop in income, which makes compliance difficult for him. The Court must give great deference to the provisions of this Act."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. The remaining delay of six months was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The Crown argued that the restrictive condition in the undertaking preventing him from drinking alcohol has caused him actual prejudice because he has been charged with, pleaded guilty to and is sentenced for, three intervening offences of breaching his undertaking. HELD: The accused was found not to have suffered actual prejudice and that the conditions of his release were noterous as to result in any significant prejudice. The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice. This is a charge so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence (see R. v. Robillard [2000] S.J. No. 345). The six-month delay was either caused by the Crown's delay in calling witnesses, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend, or Limitations on institutional resources which caused delay. The court found no evidence of how this prejudice would affect the accused in this case."
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The issues were division of the petitioner's pension, the quantum of child support and spousal support and whether the matrimonial home should be transferred to the respondent or sold and the proceeds of the marriage divided. The petitioner had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired; the husband was an undischarged bankrupt. HELD: 1)The pension plan administrator determined that the retirement method of calculating the value of the pension would be the fairest as it would not reduce the spouse's commuted value to less than 50% of the member's commuting value prior to the division. 2)The petitioner was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be so employed. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. Through the circumstances of the debts and the husband's bankruptcy, the pension plan was divided equally. 3)The parties' primary asset was the police pension. There were no funds available for any lump sum payment and the petitioner was ordered to pay $300 per month as child support for the husband for 24 years. 4)The wife was to pay child support of $350 per month commencing January 1996 and continuing for a further 3 years for so long as the child was a Child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.3(2nd Supp.)The parties were engaged throughout the majority of their marriage and each contributed the income earned to support the family. Most of the earnings were spent and few assets were acquired. The wife's primary difficulty in up-grading her skills was affected by her illness in 1976 and the lingering disabilities of her children not because the marriage. The spouse subordinated her employment demands to her family obligations. It is not unusual in a family situation where one of the parents must carry out the primary parenting duties. However, this one occurred in this family and as the boys got older, Scott became more involved as a parent. The statutory limitations apply with respect to any amount which can be transferred out of a pension plan. In this family, the spouse was employed for seven years. The husband was in the police service. He was eligible to apply for his absolute discharge in February 1996. 5)The respondent's pension was to be divided equally between the parties."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the parents could not resolve the custody issue and defer to the court to determine where the child's primary residence was located. The court found that the petitioner was a competent and loving mother and that the child was resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The child was to continue her education and socialization needs while in the petitioner's parent's home. The respondent was to obtain a mental health warrant and obtain de facto possession of the child for three weeks at a time during the school year. The petitioner was to apply for a shared parenting license and obtain a copy of the parenting report prepared by the petitioner and the mother. The mother was to appear in Provincial Court on May 10, 2013. HELD: 1) The Court held that it would be appropriate for the petitioner to be the primary parent of her child. The Court gave the respondent eight recommendations. These recommendations were based upon the totality of evidence presented at the trial. 2) The court moved independently as trier of the fact, selecting the evidence the court considers factual and relevant to the issue or issues to be determined. Once the court had considered these factors, the court applied the same principles to the law."

The plaintiff claimed judgment for the purchase price and damages for repairs to the spreader. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.

The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow the return of the spreader. 3) The plaintiff did not establish that written notice was provided to the defendants as required by s. 36.3(b) of the Act. The Court could not find that the dealer or distributor led the purchaser to believe that the notices were not required to be given pursuant to s. 36.3 of the Act.","The plaintiff purchased a new Meyer Manure Spreader, Model 5570 from the defendant Apollo Distributing Corporation (Apollo). The plaintiff claims the Spreader was 'entirely unfit for spreading compost' and did not meet the warranties imposed by operation of the Act. HELD: The action was dismissed. Costs are awarded to the defendant. The plaintiff has not established to my satisfaction, on a balance of probabilities, that the spreader was not fit for the purpose of spreading compost nor manufactured in compliance with the warranties contained in s. 36.3. Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff either in Mr. Cowan's affidavit or during his testimony, addressing the cause of breakage. If deficiencies did exist, the dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff, in his failure to allow the return of theSpreader."
5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","The Court directed the Crown to seek from the relevant police agencies or prosecution service the police reports and witness statements, including statements of the accused in respect of two Crown witnesses and particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. The Crown also directed that the documents be returned to the Court in sealed envelope for delivery. HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court found that disclosure was necessary for the accused to make full answer and defence; the nature and extent of the reasonable expectation of privacy vested in the record; whether production of the record would be premised upon any discriminatory belief or bias; [and] (5) the potential prejudice to the complainant's dignity, privacy or security of the person that would be occasioned by producing the record in question. The court also found that the third party records in the 'true relevancy' of the targeted record in the case against the accused outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material. This is particularly so in regard of criminal investigation files concerning third party accused."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. The trial judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, the sword would be distinguished from a knife, which is not necessarily weapon. 2) There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed to be used as a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other piece of decorative or decorative item. When it is open, it does not look like it has been sharpened. It is partly concealed for peaceful purposes. In this case, the accused simply stated that this type of sword is readily available in novelty stores. He also stated that in his opinion the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. The accused testified that he was unsure why he purchased the sword. He testified at the transcript 'probably just — I don't know. Hang it up in my room.... or put it on the TV or something' (R. v. Graat)."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. Until recently, the defendant golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In January 2005, the property was purchased by the White City, who entered into an agreement with Great Plains and Lorch Associates Ltd. for the continued use and enjoyment of the property. The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the latest report. HELD: 1) The plaintiff plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years.  2) The Court is not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem. The expert’s report was filed. In that report he made certain recommendations, one of which was to allow the defendants to operate the 9 hole golf course in a manner that caused errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs’ property.  3) The defendants were ordered to pay $18,000 to the plaintiffs for the loss of their lawn for 7 months of the year and $6,500 to the plaintiff for general damages as set out in the affidavits filed.  4) The plaintiffs were ordered not to pay any more money to the defendants for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  5) The defendant was ordered to enter into an indemnity clause in the development agreement between the defendants and the plaintiffs, Cattell and Mack, to prevent them from operating another golf course until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein.  6) It would appear that the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. He also sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds and to appeal on a further issue concerning corroboration. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before them. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, it was not convinced the grounds relied upon had sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s.679(3)(a) of the section. Turning to the issues, the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The two or three grounds upon which counsel for the applicant relied most heavily were the issue of corroboration-but, even then, they did not cut to all of the convictions but only some, nor to the entirety of the sentence. Finally, to a significant extent, the new grounds were very incomplete and were not sufficient to satisfy s.687(3). The Court refused to permit the application to be tried in this Court alone. On appeal the Court dismissed the appeal against the 5 to 10 year sentence on the grounds that it was frivolous and would undermine the public confidence in the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the likelihood of the applicant succeeding either in having all the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."
2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town of New Glasgow. The by-laws prohibited the erection of signs without a permit and stipulated that a sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. The Town argued that the by-law infringed its Charter rights since it was a third party sign which was not permitted in the downtown core zone. The Respondents sought to have the sign removed. Application allowed; order to issue if not removed within 15 days the sign can be removed at the expense of the respondents; costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. The application was allowed and an order was made under s266 to permit anyone to ignore the requirement for certification on the basis of a religious conviction; the limiting measures of the bylaw were rationally connected to the objective and effectively addressed unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The primary objectives of the By-laws were to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prevent distraction to motor vehicles; to prevent the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and to reduce safety concerns for pedestrians and bicyclists. The By-law also addressed the issue of whether or not signs can be permitted on private property. In this proceeding any restriction on the respondents' freedom of expression are rational and are based on preserving and facilitating the Town's planning goals. The violation is reasonably and demonstrably justifiable within the meaning of s.1 of the Charter. HELD: The application and order were allowed. The respondent Town was ordered to remove the sign by 15 days. Costs were awarded against the respondents.  1)The limiting measures were rational as they were based on reducing the number of signs with a certain restriction upon size in specific areas in accordance with its objectives. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs could be placed and does not prevent advertising, but only limits it. 2)Limiting signs on private land was not necessary in order to achieve the objective. The means used by the township to achieve its goal were reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant's s.2(b) rights. It is not necessary to regulate the provision of a development permit which is not subject to the right to proliferation. Most of the time, the restrictions have little or no effect on the respondent’s right of expression. 3)Limits on the right of free speech were demonstrably justified."

The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act. 1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error. The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition.

Because of disputes over ownership between the plaintiffs and the defendant, the latter commenced an action against the plaintiffs seeking declaration as to the validity of the tax sale. The Municipality later sued the plaintiffs for general damages resulting in the plaintiff taking possession of the property. The plaintiff winterized the property leaving it 'as it always did'. Legal costs incurred at the first trial were set forth at $39,385.82. The Court of Appeal apportioned liability between the Municipality and the Director of Assessment at 50% each. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees together with some other items of loss and general damages. The plaintiffs claim a series of items of damage to the property alleged to have occurred while they were out of possession. The damages alleged may very well have been caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through winter months. The grounds for the reversal was that such damage as claimed occurred and did so when the plaintiffs were in possession and the defendants must be held responsible. The defendant brought an action for legal fees in the face of the decision in the Attorney General's v. Maclnnes et al, which overturned the trial division basically on the grounds that the legal fees were too remote and unforeseeable for the plaintiff in that action, as well as in the same action, which failed."

The court relied primarily on the third paragraph of Clause 301 of Article III of CAPL 1981 for information as to the amount of the screw pump costs incurred. It was not necessary to decide the issue as the Court was satisfied that the defendant approved of and consented to the drilling of both leg one and drilling of leg two and that the plaintiff was negligent in conducting the drilling operations or did it otherwise make improper charges in its accounting procedures. At the material time, the defendant never suggested that the parties pause to consider stopping at leg one. As the plaintiff had destroyed a perfectly good well capable of producing no less than 100 barrels of oil per day, its maximum liability for drilling and completion costs is 35 percent of the total costs referred to in the Supplemental AFE and it was not reasonable to assume that the costs incurred would result in the same amount being paid to the defaulting Joint-Operator."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a Bond contained in s.55(1). Almost every application would so qualify because in most cases the nearest relatives and public trustee consent in writing and the court could then order a fee for service to be paid from time to time to the property guardian out of the estate of the adult. 2) The applicant did not have adequate assets to administer the estate. The four children who were not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of bond.  3) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. The plaintiff's passenger was knocked unconscious and received cut to the head requiring three or four stitches. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty on all charges.  1)The court found that the defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded by ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failing of yield, the defence of due diligence has been established. 2)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."

To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Neither counsel for the respondent nor the petitioner had canvassed the financial records of the numbered corporation, owned by the petitioner's husband, to be disclosed. Counsel for Mr. Overs also sought financial information pertaining to the ranching operation where the petitioner looked after the cattle while the father was operating the truck. HOLD: The Court dismissed both applications with costs of $500 to the petitioner.  1) The Court would not require the petitioner to produce any of the company's financial records in order to determine the child's income. Whether the petitioner canvassed for the records would not have the slightest merit because the parties could ill afford such expense and they would be poorly advised to pursue such a course.  2) The respondent's assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce her father's farming accounts was not supported by the evidence. The fact that the respondent's income is deposited into a joint bank account does not justify imputing portion of that income to the homemaker spouse.  3) The petitioner did not provide any farm income or expense banking accounts of her own, she had no permit book and offered nothing to substantiate her annual income from the farming and cattle operation with the father other than her annual tax returns. The petitioner demonstrated that she devoted but 1 hour per month performing such duties. When one considers that the corporation owns but one truck, operated by Mr. Petersen, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that the Court would require an examination of Janice's father's books of account would reveal which would assist the Court in establishing that Janice Petersen has earned more income than the amount revealed in her income tax return. Although the respondent stated that he would continue to canvass for financial information relevant to these proceedings, there is not shred of evidence to support that statement. It has also been submitted that the financial files of the trucking corporation owned by Janice and her husband should be disclosed as they are confidential. Although it has been asserted that"
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry. Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but required an adjournment as that witness was not available to testify on this date. The Crown opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of the accused. The Court held that there was a reasonable expectation that the accused could be called as a witness for the preliminary hearing and that there would be sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial for the offences charged. The Defence was not negligent in not making arrangements to call the first witness available at preliminary inquiry, let alone their entire case.  1) Unlike at trial, justice conducting preliminary inquiry has no power to direct Crown counsel to call certain witnesses. It has an unfettered discretion to call whatever witnesses it requires. 2) When the Defence is advised that Sergeant Barbar is halfway around the world on a peace keeping mission in the middle of a war zone, do not think that they are negligent in failing to not going to the trouble and expense of preparing a subpoena that could not be effectively served on him in any event. 3) There is a reasonable prospect that he can be summoned on the July 26 preliminary inquiry date. There is no doubt that he will be called."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; there was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer did not satisfy the notice requirement. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)A person was lawfully arrested, detained and released on an Appearance Notice by the arresting officer. That Appearance Notice forms part of the court record and purports to be signed by the accused. On the date specified on that notice the accused was not present but his counsel appeared, waived reading of the allegation, entered a not guilty plea and scheduled a date for trial. This constitutes prima facie proof of identity and there is no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice is the same person who has stood trial. 2)The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible. The Court was referred to authorities to the effect that the Crown failed to establish that the accused had been disqualified or prohibited from driving and the accused is acquitted. 3)Section 260(6) does not apply to any proceedings unless at least 7 days notice in writing is given to the accused that it is intended to tender the Certificate in evidence. In the case at hand, the officer observed an individual operating a motor vehicle and properly obtained his name and date of birth. The officer warned him that if he lied about his identity, he could be charged with obstructing a police officer. No evidence was given as to the nature of that disqualification and the voluntariness of the statements were not in issue. The Certificate of Intention to Tender was also tendered for identification."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants based on allegations that one or more of the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants knew the helicopters were unsafe, and alleged that the Cameco group of defendants could not avoid liability by reason of having hired an independent contractor. The defence claimed that such a question was irrelevant as it was not in issue prior to the accident. It was pertinent to determine the date the helicopter was placed on board the helicopters. The Certificate of Analysis was prepared and the questions were asked were answered. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. The court found that the theories proposed by the plaintiffs were not relevant to the trial as they did not raise any issues of relevance and were not questions asked specifically about the safety of the helicopter. The Court found that by disclosing the theory, it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a particular issue in issue."

b_1999canlii12440.txt,"In the first application under the Family Maintenance Act the father sought to reduce child maintenance of $250 per child per month to an amount in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines; cancellation of arrears of $13,273.39; and increased access. In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the following relief: 1. Variation of child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable thereunder from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by The Act; 2. Cancellation of the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and 3. variation of the access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The Court was prepared to deal with the remaining $22,993.39 that were accrued during the 1993 to 1997 period by ordering that upon the payment of $5000 on account of $6,745.39 accrued prior to December 31, 1998, the balance of Arrears accrued prior prior to such date shall be extinguished. 2)The Court was not prepared to extinguish any of the other obligations of the respondent. With respect to the first issue, the Court ordered that he have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 3)The court also ordered that the petitioner should have access on a less-than-full weekend within the meaning of the Act.

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a member of the respondent union and had been employed at the time of the grievance as front desk manager for the hotel. She filed a grievance alleging that her work hours had been reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The respondent employer applied for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision, seeking to have it set aside under s.15(2) of the Arbitration Act. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 is wide enough to encompass the situation, and that its interpretation could not be said to be patently unreasonable. The appellant also argued that the arbitration provisions of the collective agreement which were effective October 1, 1999 and expire September 30, 2002 provide for an indefinite reduction of hours within the department. In issue was whether the respondent employer breached the provisions of s.9:01 (and the application of hotel seniority) so that it could apply to the situation where an individual employee's work hours were reduced due to a personnel change. HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis that the interpretation of the clause which applied to the reduction of the working hours by the hotel was patently unrealistic. It was also found to be inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties. The court ordered the interpretation and application of the arbitration provision to be set aside."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. HELD: The Crown appeal is dismissed. In this case the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. While the Crown's case was built around the issue of speed, the trial judge did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant's speed with either the mens rea or the actus reus. The court was not satisfied that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the speed of the accused's vehicle was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances. The trial court erred in law by not considering that the appellant admitted he was speeding in a construction zone. It is an error of law for a trial judge to confuse an issue of fact with either an element of the offense. In R. v. Morin, [1988] S.C.R. 345 at p. 374, the Supreme Court of Canada held that a significant fault element is required in order to establish dangerous driving for the purposes of the imposition of criminal punishment. Here, the Crown failed to show that an error in law could have a material bearing on an acquittal. The Court was prepared to accept that the accused’s speed was not the only circumstance to consider. However, not so much as to mistake the facts."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The first motion was brought by the former police officer who was charged with serious criminal offences. He was detained in custody for 4 days and suspended from his employment as a police officer for 5 months. He commenced this action fifteen months after the stay of proceedings was entered. The remaining motions were granted summarily and one was adjourned sine die. The defendants then applied for an order pursuant to Rule 188 extending the limitation period to a further year. Dismissing the applications, that even though there was a factual component and an agreed statement of facts, there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. With the consent of the plaintiff, the application to dismiss the claim was dismissed. There were a number of substantive issues to be determined, including whether the action was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc, whether a portion of the claim disclosed a cause of action, and whether the plaintiff had a prima facie case."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one and therefore was not garnished."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were whether the mother's failure to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refusal to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of its original judgment had been grounds for the application. HELD: 1) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The increased contact with his extended family in the Yukon, including his grandparents and his maternal grandparents, provided an increased social network that would be in the child's best interest. 2) There had been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary, was possible. The mother now opposed the application for the grant of sole custody to the father but stated that she hoped to move away from the current arrangement and would be more secure in Whitehorse once she demonstrated that she could be trusted not to attempt to abduct the child. 3) There was no evidence that the mother had stopped the father from exercising the shared parenting which he had previously been granted. The evidence at trial was positive. The father had taken the child out of the province and it was not in his best interests for him to be granted sole custody. The custodial parent's reason for moving was not supported by the evidence. 4) The child was too young to take into account the views of both the mother and the father. The decision of the SCC in Gordon v. Goertz was based on the same principles as that in Allston v. Kurz. 577 (CanLII), 2004 SKQB 275 (6th) 372."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders of the Board made in May 2004 and June 2004. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the union. The applicant brought an application for judicial review of the May 2004 orders, arguing that the orders infringed the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Charter, the meaning of employer influence and the Charter rights of the parties who were designated by the Board asInterested Parties. In its amended notice of motion and detailed legal brief, the Board acknowledged that the Board had limited jurisdiction on a judicial review issue but asserted that it had the authority to compel the applicant to produce documents in contravention of previous rulings it had made. It also acknowledged that some of the documents sought might well enjoy solicitor-and-client privilege but added an additional requirement of its own: as well as any other documents that clarify the job functions and duties of the department managers. The interested parties submitted that, depending on how the hearings progress, they may be before the Court on similar issues, including the constitutional issue. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board ordered that the applicant produce the following documents: a copy of the first affidavit submitted by the applicant, copies of the applicant's application and submissions, and a written decision respecting any document discovery or production order that it might make pursuant to those orders. In this sense, the order was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record.  1) The Board conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. It has placed little reliance on the affidavit evidence. These portions would normally have been struck. 2) It is not in dispute that the board had the jurisdiction to order documents respecting communications to employees regarding trade unions or unionization as have emphasized as important the documents are clearly relevant to an issue before the Board. The Court will not intervene unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them into its order.  3) There is nothing in the decision to indicate that Wal- Mart Canada was relieved of compliance with any aspect of the subpoena or that it no longer required. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy or privilege respecting each document. 4) The application for"
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated using average renewals for the prior two quarters. The plaintiff, who had been employed for 26 years as a sales agent, claimed that since compensation is calculated in part on the basis of the prior month's sales, the length of service of the contract and the relocation counselling services were all factors in determining the appropriate period of notice. Awarding the plaintiff one month's arrears of salary, that the defendant failed to mitigate his damages by making reasonable efforts to find alternative employment. The court distinguished between the claim of reasonable notice provided by Allstate and that of a dismissed employee. The dismissed employee had worked in the insurance industry for 25 years and was regarded as one of the industry's top sales agents. Although his compensation at the time of his termination was $1,800 to $3,000 per month, he experienced difficulty in obtaining new insurance when he was precluded from soliciting or selling to persons he had previously known to him for two years. However, his difficulties in obtaining employment were not caused by this clause."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties had been in a relationship for approximately thirty years and had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement and alleged that the husband was abusive of her. The parties had little face to face communication and the wife frequently did not respond to the husband's reasonable requests involving the children. The husband requested that the children be placed in his sole care and custody, although the wife had indicated that she would not cooperate with his requests for the children's care. Joint custody of the children was granted, with the order that all assets be divided between the parties, and that all children be parented by one parent for an equal period of time. However, joint custody was not granted in the best interest interest interest because of the wife's allegations of abuse and neglect. Children do benefit from joint parenting because they will have the benefit of the expedience, knowledge and analysis provided by each parent. However an appropriate consideration of each parent's viewpoint may not occur if there is a power imbalance. The evidence showed that the wife was not a credible witness. The children had been exposed to the effects of domestic violence on their relationships with their parents. The Court was satisfied the parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing until November to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. There was nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission's consideration of disqualification of the appellant's application if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective assistance of his non-lawyer agent on the assault charge. The Office of the Queen's Bench President was awarded $2,500 to represent the appellant at the criminal trial on the grounds that there was a miscarriageof justice arising out of the conduct of the trial. The officer’s lack of ability by itself was not a ground for determining that a miscarriage occurred. There was no unfairness to the appellant in the trial process. The decision to not testify was made freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. The accused was in no position to review his reasons to determine if the appeal should proceed.

The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits. Since there is nothing in the Act that allows the court to extend the time for filing an appeal, to deny the application for judicial review would deny the applicant an opportunity to pursue her only remedy in the circumstances.","This was an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664(1) and 674 for an order quashing a decision of the Office of the Rentalsman.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff and his insurer, ING, signed a Statutory Declaration confirming that the plaintiff had sold the van to the woman he had seen in the mall earlier that day. The statement purported to show that the accused was the driver of the vehicle that had struck the plaintiff and that he had then proceeded to purchase a second vehicle from the same woman. Although the plaintiff testified that he only stayed 5 to 10 minutes in the security office with the police during which time he said that he heard the man identify himself to him as the driver, he testified at trial that he admitted to having no idea who the second person was. HELD: The plaintiff's version of events began to unravel. His evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court could not find either of the defendants or any of them on the stand. It will have to decide whether the sum is to be paid by Allstate or by ING. 1) The facts in this case are very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially relate to the issues of the identity of the van and the driver and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it when the incident occurred. Since the defendant did not reach the parking lot until after the van had sped away, the only clear evidence before the court on the identity was that of the plaintiff himself. It is pertinent to note that prior to trial, the plaintiff acknowledged that he was doing both alcohol and drugs in that time period and had cocaine addiction. He admitted that he traded the van for drugs, but had no record of it. 2) The plaintiff was awarded an all-inclusive sum of $162,500. The figure agreed upon was the all inclusive sum. What remains for the court to decide is whether that sum should be paid either way."
9_2003skqb459.txt,"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to traffic in a motor vehicle with a significant amount of marijuana. The evidence was obtained after the initial stop with the assistance of a flashlight. At the outset of the trial the accused took the position that her rights pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all evidence obtained post-stopping should be excluded pursuant to s24(2). HELD: The accused was found guilty of all counts.  1) There can be no quarrel with the visual inspection of a vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to check for sobriety, licences, insurance and the mechanical fitness of cars. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the vehicle. The accused's words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. 2) The Court was not persuaded that the accused's testimony that she was able to smell marijuana in the interior of the vehicle would constitute reasonable grounds for lawful detention but it was entirely reasonable to conclude that there were reasonable and probable grounds for search. The strong odour of raw cannabis in the vehicle could have been the result of a trafficking offence. The presence of a small child in the back seat with a blanket and a red bag with a red stain on it provide reasonable grounds to inquire as to whether there could possibly be a hidden weapon. 3) The evidence did not raise any particular issues with respect to the presence of evidence in relation to the search for drugs or alcohol. The search was incidental to the check stop program carried out after dark. The police need not ignore other legitimate aspects of their general duties and powers when manning the check stops. In the circumstances, either officer had every right to open the car door and speak to the passenger."

This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have a solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving a previous attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of solicitors. The solicitor had been active in representing the defendant Crown corporation during the years prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. 1)Much was made by the applicant of the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigating of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. By reference to strategy counsel the applicant seems to suggest that the company has such litigation strategy and internal policies and procedures of confidential nature that could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. A review of the file suggests that no such strategy existed. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 2)The applicant was attempting to discredit the plaintiff's claims with respect to its own statutory and contractual affairs. It had been referred to in previous decisions involving similar moves by previous solicitors but this one was different because the applicant was relying on strategy counsel."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.",The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.",The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02) because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule.  There was also insufficient evidence before the Court to consider whether the motions should be heard individually or in sequence.

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused sought to exclude DNA evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter rights were breached when the police took a sample of his blood. He appealed the voir dire decision.

The Court found that s. 487.05 of the Code contemplates analysis of a sample taken from a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance 'found' in circumstances described in s.485(b) and that because, in this case, no such bodily substance was 'found', no blood sample could be considered part of comparative analysis if he consented to such."

They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred.

6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. The convictions were set aside and the fines and surcharges were restored. 1)The circumstances in this case were such as to bring the case squarely within these provisions. The matter need not, and should not, have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not to the extent and to the effect the judge thought appropriate. 2)There is nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they too must stand."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The Director argued that the Chambers judge had overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court held that it was not appropriate to grant leave to appeal under s. 3 of The Act. With respect to issues (a) and (b), the Court was not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court. There was no exceptional circumstances in which the Court could have taken the position that the judge had made four errors in coming to his decision.

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant, aged 34, sustained injury to his lower back in an automobile accident. The back injury resolved within 10 days to 2 weeks. He applied for income replacement benefits contending the accident did not cause the disc herniation. He appealed to the respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denying his claim for benefits. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on the basis of two family physicians. The first was his family physician prior to the accident. Up to October 1994, he was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no evidence of any back problems. A review of all of the evidence showed that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the hernaiation was caused by the automobile."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood while awaiting to provide a sample into the approved screening device, find that he was not. The observation period was not conducted properly as the police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussed on the accused. The video had no audio component and it was not necessary to look 'eyeball to eyeball' at the accused for the entire duration of the observation period as that is viewed as a reasonable limit prescribed by law and justified under s. of the Charter. There was sufficient factual similarity between the accused and this case that it could not be distinguished on the facts. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By does not stand for the proposition that an accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights must be implemented at roadside during the screening techniques in every instance. The facts in An are materially different from the facts in this case and are clearly distinguishable. The accused did not attempt to call counsel nor did he ask permission to do so. When he was advised of his rights to counsel after his arrest and demand for breath sample he declined the opportunity to call a lawyer on two occasions."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The next day, the plaintiff suffered a sudden and massive hemorrhage. The physician who had performed the caesarian section failed to remove the bleeding from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure. HELD: The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were not proven. The medical evidence showed that the likely cause of the bleeding was retained products of conception. The surgical care provided by the physician was not the only method used to remediate the bleeding. The failure of the physician to perform the D & C was considered. The plaintiff was awarded judgment for general damages of $50,000.00.  1)The Court held that it did not believe that the specific determination of that point would affect or change the resolution of the causation issue. 2)There was no evidence to suggest that the operating room nurses' notes were a fabrication of something that did not happen. The doctors were not called to explore any possibility of error. The report of operation was both realistic and reasonable. 3)The female plaintiff had the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the physician failed to perform C. The Court adopted the reasoning in Ares v. Venner (1995), 107 Man. R. (2d) 225 in applying Ares v., which held that if there was a miscarriage, it should be found to be a miscarriage. 4)Although there was some evidence that the surgical care offered by the defendant was inadequate in preventing the bleeding, it was nevertheless a clinical decision to proceed with a hysterectomy. 5)Given the advanced stage of the necrosis and degree of deterioration in the cervix, it is readily apparent that the condition had been in existence for some time. However, the Court was unable to determine whether the physician actually performed the D& C, aprocedure which would have remedied the haemorrhaging which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the Hysterestomy."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was convicted of failure to provide a sample. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain a sample and that the intoxilyzer did not register because he was not blowing properly into the mouthpiece."

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)A mandatory injunction can only be granted where the plaintiff shows a very strong probability upon the facts that grave damage will accrue to him in the future. This test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong prima facie, case that must be proven in a negative injunction application. 2)The applicants failed to meet the first and second tests of the test. They failed to present evidence of the harm predicted by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the inevitable decline in value. 3)If the plaintiffs' application was successful, they would be required, under Queen's Bench Rule 390, to pay full compensation before the order sought was issued. 4)The Court had already dealt with the considerably greater inconvenience to the respondents should the desired order be granted, than would be the inconvenience if it were not granted."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08) and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: 1) The accused's evidence was not credible as it tends to show that the alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment.  2) The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was impaired. It was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption this evening and early morning (where he said he wanted to avoid seizure of his truck on the highway but was concerned about losing his Class licence) and that his belief that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway was a mistake of law because what accept was this officer's power to stop the accused under s. 209.1 of that Act taken together with the Court's interpretation of the extension of that power from public road to private road in Anderson[1] was a reasonable excuse for not stopping for police officer. 3) There is no doubt that Mr. Lehman was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that this factor, taken togetherwith the time since this day, has effected his recollection of this day and what he drank. However, given that finding, where the evidence of Cobbledick and the accused is at odds, the Court rejected the evidence and accepted the evidenceof Cst. Cobbledicka."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused is charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The Crown cannot demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the wall in the minute following the transaction with Mr. Burke. HELD: The accused is found guilty on both counts. The court accepted the Crown's evidence that the transactions between the accused and the buyer were regular street level drug trafficking and that the encounters between the buyer and the accused were consistent with these drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in the crack cocaine as an explanation for the absence of the agent benedryl was not supported by the evidence as it was not made as part of the analysis of the transaction. Although the accused's description of what he saw in the street was obscured by the trees, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to purchase more crack cocaine was consistent with the behaviour of the accused during the purchase and during the sale of the drugs. The encounters were not directly with the buyer but with the accused making an effort to observe the transaction from a different vantage point."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and (2)having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1(b) of the Criminal Code and (1) operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to Motor Vehicle s.249(1)). The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There will be no costs. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge committed no error in finding and finding a breach of s.10(b).  1)The trial judge did not fail to consider the various indications set forth in R. v. Grant, [2009] S.C.R. 353. 2)The fact remains that when the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned. The accused was not provided an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice.  3)The respondent's attitude was not one of indifference, but of indifference. Rather, it was an indifference to the situation which rendered any wavier ineffective."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the 'City') with certain conditions. Although the demolition order was dated November 18, 2004, legal proceedings had extended the life of the building at that time. The building inspector at the time of the order advised the respondent that he should apply to the court for an adjournment to allow the appellant to remedy the underlying problems. The respondent sought leave from the Court of Queen's Bench to bring forth his written proposal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. 2) The Board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. In this way, the board has ensured that the plaintiff knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed.  3) There is no merit to the contention that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide on the disclosure of the police files. It would be incumbent on the applicant to pursue other avenues including application to the Court for subpoena or other Order directing production of documents."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied under the Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The Director's application was granted.  1) The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is an in rem remedy. 2) There is no retroactivity problem. The evidence on when the Director 'became satisfied' the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activity is found in the Affidavit of Tammy Pryznyk sworn December 15, 2016. She deposed to having purchased a truck from Butler in 2007. The RPS executed a search warrant in July 2008 and discovered that none of the items were in fact stolen and all were returned to him. The Director indicated that although the police seized a number of items which were allegedly stolen, it was subsequently established that none had been returned. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. He was ordered to pay $600 per month as support for the child. The mother was underemployed and, if returned to school, her payments would be taxed on a net of tax basis. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and/or return to school will not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  2) On all of the evidence it is obvious that the father's financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has been successful on this motion. 3) The mother's decision to work minimum amounts each year (i.e. to work 3 months of the year) is not a rational decision when his child is not attending school and will severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It is also likely that he has not made an aggressive decision to terminate his employment within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.",The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of Queen v.

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: break and enter a dwelling house; theft; jewellery; theft. The sentencing judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999. She also considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. The community support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training is likely to be more effective than the one imposed for offences of this nature. 2)The respondent is 38 years old with 49 prior convictions.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.

HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. Moreover, this is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as it did to be applied by local people with no special training, except for the administrators. 2)There was no prejudice in the way the Committee interpreted the provisions of s. 303(1) of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board Act, which provided for a 20 day appeal period. Rather, the word give was imported the necessity of receipt, just as the Committee did. 3)At best, this amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort, as was the case here, where notice was mailed on the day before the period expired, was being delivered (the day after) and was delivered the day after. As might have been expected, nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the requirements of the legislation. 4)Wascana Energy exercised its right to appeal properly or at least effectively, requiring the board to entertain the appeal.  5)The appeal would be allowed in the form of a written notice submitted by registered mail within 20 days of the mailing or publication of the notice.

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg.

He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The respondent then applied to the court for an order of prohibition.

The parties conducted their business together according to the terms of the 2004 agreement with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to sixty cents per day per cow. Another sixty calves were delivered to Dobson's pastures in the spring and summer. Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be. He testified that he had heard some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he had never received a bill from them. HELD: The Court dismissed the claim.

To refuse the application under s. of the Contributory negligence act would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. The applicant also referred this court to the case of Truong v. Saskatoon (City), 2001 SKQB 419. There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for a local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of The Urban Municipality Act states that no action may be brought pursuant to subsection (1) for the recovery of damages caused by the presence, absence, or insufficiency of any earth, rock, tree or other material or thing adjacent to or in along or on a street that is not on the travelled portion of the street. There was no causal connection between the cause of action pled in the statement of claim and the plaintiff's claim."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","A young offender pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and two counts of dangerous driving prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation.

He used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA], in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The issue in Andrew (CA) is whether or not the trial judge considered Hrynewich Holdings in its entirety. An application of the principles set out in Andrew leads to the conclusion that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675.99. The respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellants in that amount as at March 23, 2016. HELD: The appeal is allowed.  1) The portion of the loan attributable to the purchase of the land is 64.03% (64.03%) and is credited against $66,770.48 leaving a balance of $18,770 to be paid off. The purchase money portion is $536,186.72. 2) The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. However, these proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan and the respondent then sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.  3) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding. 4) The portions of the judgment that are owed to the mortgagee are reduced to $132,582.48 and are protected by s. 25 of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act. 5) The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to taking out the deficiency against the appellant in the amount amount of $31,160.23. 6) The Court will look at the extent to which s. 2 of the LCRA should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to both the purchase money debt and the non Purchase money portion. In the absence of such a provision, neutral approach involves allocation of the payment on a pro-rated basis to debt affected by section and nonpurchase-money debt.

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The respondent applied to vary the terms of the consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody of their daughter and the alternative was that the respondent sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the respondent's care since that time. The mother had been a stay-at-home mom and raised the daughter with the respondent. She had advised the applicant of her intention to move to Kelowna in early June and discussed the possibility of the applicant selling the furniture that she did not need and allowing the applicant to move back into the matrimonial home. HELD: 1)While there is no legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, the views of the child are entitled to great respect. 2)There has been an existing custody arrangement for almost 3 years. The applicant concedes the respondent is a good mother and there is nothing to dispute the close relationship that exists between her and the child. However, there was nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have beenreasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. 3)It appears the child has a close relationship with both parents. The only issue is the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal from the community. As a result the trial of an issue will be required. 4)As the applicant is seeking interim relief without determination on the merits, feel compelled to consider the context in which the request for interim relief arises. It is clear that the child became aware in June of the respondent moving to British Columbia and that discussions took place. There was no evidence that she raised any objection to the move.

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered as a result of the unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras for services it had never been paid for. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the tender, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender was inconsequential. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and thereby reduce the build up of methane gas and the risk of fire within the banks. The equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender and was used to lift coal from various stock piles to the VJCPP. When fire occurred in the bank the equipment was loaded into railcars or trucks for delivery to the customer's customers. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement was dismissed. The court found that although the plaintiff had accepted the scope of the operations contemplated in the purchase order, the contractual obligation for maintaining the banks was not as extensive as it would have been if the tender had been used. As the nature of the work was different from that of the previous contract, the plaintiff's responsibilities were not as detailed as they would have otherwise been. Further, as the plaintiff failed to comply with the terms and conditions in the previous tender, it was unable to provide the services it requested and relied upon for which it was never paid."

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child.

The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and the mother was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child. The parties agreed that a gradual reintroduction of the child into their home would be best, but both parties had an opportunity to prevent escalation. The mother could have allowed the father to take the jacket and leave without getting into a tug-of-war with the father. HELD: 1)The evidence did not support the mother's allegation that the father had threatened her with removal or that he had placed the child in situations where there were peanuts present. 2)The father was not to be under the influence of any non-prescription drug 12 hours before and while he was in his care. 3)The child was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent. 4)The court reviewed the history of spousal abuse and concluded that it did not necessarily mean that joint custody was inappropriate. The court found that although the father loves the child and would do no purposeful harm, he still has family in Egypt and Kuwait and there is a real prospect that he could obtain a passport there. 5)The mother was to have supervised access for two weeks at a time.  6)Both parties were urged by the mother to accept all of the evidence she had provided as reliable and to reject the evidence of the father about threats to harm the child or about his placing the child with someone who is not a custodial parent. The evidence was inconclusive as to whether he had made any threats.  7)There was no evidence that the Father had physically or verbally abused the child nor was there a realistic likelihood of him removing her from her current residence.  8)The respondent was directed to take appropriate steps to ensure that his access was uninterrupted for at least two weeks.  9)The applicant was not prepared to participate in any sort of supervised exercise.

The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.

e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of Constable Power, who was charged and convicted in the Provincial Court of committing an assault causing bodily harm, pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant had used more force than was necessary to either defend himself or effect the arrest of the complainant under s. 25(1)of the Code or by applying the new self-defence provisions. The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court. HELD: Leave was granted, the appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the provincial court. The conviction was reinstated. 1) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the evidence or in his use of force. There were a number of factors that must be considered in assessing whether there is an air of reality to an accused's claim that the force used was objectively no more than necessary for the purpose of making an arrest. 2) The jurisprudence regarding s.25(1), s.34(1)(a) and s.35(2) was well established and the principles to be applied are fundamentally the same for both provisions. In dealing with s.33(1)) of the Code, the Court held that the test to be objective was flawed. It was open to the appellant to assess the evidence and to apply the correct standard of appellate review. However, it was not open to him to review the video in detail and draw his own conclusions."

The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was subject to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of breach of his rights under the Charter. The primary defence was that the police officer who detained the accused did not inform him of the reason for his detention and had not advised him that he could consult counsel. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1) The police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused. However, they did not have the means to detain him. The police officer, who had remained with the accused during the alleged operation of the vehicle, was not aware that the accused was the driver. When the police arrived at the scene, they approached the accused on his lawn. They believed and it was reasonable to believe that the complainant had positively identified the accused as the operator of the motor vehicle. Once detained, police officers may detain an individual if there are reasonable grounds to suspect in all the circumstances that the individual is connected to a particular crime and that the detention is reasonably necessary on an objective view of the circumstances. 2) The defence sought to exclude the evidence of the fob and keys which was a significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused, which was not supported by the physical evidence. The search and seizure of the keys and fob had no particular reason for the officer to be concerned for the safety of himself or others when he did the search. Applying the Grant analysis, would not have excluded any other evidence. 3) The Court was faced with a case where the defence breached the accused's rights for about 11 minutes, by not informing him of his detention or by not giving him his right to contact counsel without delay."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal listed in the notice of appeal are that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ply beam, notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete Grade beam was not established at trial. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the ground, could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector. The respondent may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward. There is no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. 2) In the case of Kitzul v. Ungar, [1991] SCC 45 (CanLII), the court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. These questions are to be answered upon an examination of the proceedings as a whole."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. It was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. 2)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate either party. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found. However, the argument that the Crown failed to present sufficient evidence to present an offence or indeed an offence of any kind was not supported by this evidence. In either case the 'circumstantial evidence of opportunity' was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond areasonable doubt. 3)The entitlement to address a jury last, contained in s.686(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, applies without a substantive curbing of the entitlement in this case."

The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with their mother, decided to buy and operate a coffee and donut franchise. Although the parties had agreed on the valuation and physical division of the matrimonial assets and debts, the physical division represented an unequal division in favour of the respondent to the extent of $16,868. The respondent sought an order specifying the terms and conditions of a deferral of the business loan, including an interest rate or return on investment, and sought to have life insurance at least at its present level and sufficient to produce an income stream equal to the support payments ordered. HELD: 1)The court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the divorce. There was no possibility of reconciliation. 2)The trial judge was left with exercising her or her discretion to determine the effect of the marriage in impairing or improving each spouse's future economic prospects and attempting to achieve an equitable sharing of the economic consequences of their marriage breakdown. In exercising her discretion, the court will consider the specific circumstances of the case before the court. 3)The respondent was to continue working with the franchise and to assist in the management of its business. She was to take some time off to retrain. 4)The courts were of the view that the 'needs and means' test is not the exclusive basis for determining spousal support under the 1985 Divorce Act. The principles of support espoused in Heinenann were not altered. The court reviewed the diverse set of authorities and applied them to the present situation."

HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed.

The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsman heard the tenants' applications in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.'s written judgment. In the third hearing, the landlord in the second hearing wanted a writ of possession so as to assist with relocation costs. The Deputy rentalsman granted this order and the tenants appealed it. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman was restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs. 1)There was little or no chance for the parties to reconcile their differences whatever they may be. The differences between the landlord and tenant did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by the tenants. Some deference must be shown to those aspects of the landlord's decisions which reflect an exercise ofretion. 2)The deputy rentals was exercising jurisdiction under s.47(4) and it was possible for him to so exercise that jurisdiction. 3)Where an application is made to the courts, the appellate jurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction. 4)The Court's function must be limited to determining whether Sirois J. erred in so concluding."

Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",A medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The medical doctor argued that the Committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the investigation of him. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. 1)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and acted on inadequate materials. There was no evidence to support the Committee's determination on this basis.  2)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that Huerto's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee committed an error in law by undertaking a review at the request of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and not the Director of Medical Professional Review Committee. 3)It did not abuse its discretion or exercise its right to determine what was acceptable medical practice. 4)No error was made. 5)Costs were recovered by the Committee.
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: This is an application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993.

At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000 and by 1993 the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income.

b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties were agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. There remains for determination the quantum ofmaintenance for the children, spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property.

If indeed Mary did receive the greater share of the pension, it could be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. However, fairness and equity required a combination of both approaches to be used. 3)The evidence showed that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-point) the termination and retirement method was the route to go."

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to consider that the complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood to have been made about another man. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 2)The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility.  3)The appellant had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. The trial judge should have been directed to allow the complainant to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of her previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault."

Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in a 40 km zone. Upon arriving at the RCMP detachment at 2:12 am, the officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. The roadside screening test was performed and the accused failed the roadside test. As result the officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample as requested by the defence. The officer read from his 'card' when making the screening demand and then read those demands from that card when giving his evidence. He offered no information about the ability of others in his company to observe the accused's drinking and driving behaviour. HELD: The defence application was dismissed. 1) The accused's evidence did not have an air of objectivity to it. There was only vague explanation of the time from 11:00 p.m., when they quit work at the shop, to 12:30 or 12:45 a.M. If the solution was deficient it would produce an inaccurate reading. 2) The defence had no reason to demand production of the standard alcohol solution. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with a genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The failure of the Crown to produce representative ampoules to the accused constituted a violation of s. s. of the Charter. 3) The Court was not satisfied with the defence's application once it was established that the request was unreasonable. 4) There was no evidence to the contrary that the defence sought production of representative ampounles once it had been established that they could not be produced at the detachment due to the high alcohol content of the breath sample and the absence of a breathalyser."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of using a weapon in a sexual assault contrary to s. 246.2 of the Criminal Code. He now applies for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order made by the trial judge. Allowing the appeal and ordering a dismissal of the conviction, that the appellant had failed to show that the complainant's evidence would be reasonably capable of believing and in addition, that his evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction could be entered. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable error of fact on the trial judge's part. Findings of fact are not made with respect to this kind of assessment unless and until an independent investigation is made. 2)The trial judge was unable to say beyond any reasonable doubt that A. M.'s ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol on the date in question."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which was not covered by the original policy. The Homeowners were awarded recovery against SGI equal to 50% of the judgment.  1)The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary SGI, which the insurer agreed to undertake. SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. It was clear that the trial judge relied on that portion of the application form where the previous McCallum Hill policy number was stated together with the reference to the support document SF 222. The question is whether these references provided an adequate direction to the insurer about the coverage that was to be procured for the homeowners. 2)SGI is not a third party to the Contributory Negligence Act. In practice, SGI does not compare a previous policy with a new policy application to make sure that any changes in coverage are intentional. There is no such general duty on the insurer.  3)There are a number of issues on which insurance intermediaries may be found liable to insurers or customers and the nature of the duty that liability implies. In this case, the defendant insurer held SGI liable for the accidental breakage of its Swarovski collection, which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the policy. It is clear that TWC and SGI are intermediaries within the meaning of the term 'facilitator'. SGI were not the exclusive agent for one insurer."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. As the CBA provides for wage adjustments going back to 2008, it requires substantial lump-sum adjustment payments for many of the employees.HELD: The motions to strike were dismissed. It was necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs were entitled to mandatory injunctive relief. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which were beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiffs presented abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now could conceivably be met. They were unable to quantify, for the purposes of assessing damages, the monetary value to some of the 2011 retirees of imposing practical limits on their choices of when to retire."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 753(a)(i) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying against him. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove that the offender exhibited a substantial degree of indifference respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to others of his behaviour. It did not have to prove either of those things. The accused had met the onus of proving both patterns of behaviour in R. v. Lemaigre (2004), [TWLII], [2003] SCC 46. HELD: 1) The accused is a long-term offender and the Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. 2) The facts of this offence leave no doubt that the Crown has proved that the indictable offence under s. 267(b) involved the use of violence against the complainant. Furthermore, this offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 3) There can be no burden of proof on the Crown to negate the third criterion contained in s753(1)(a). The Court found that it has a duty to be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the offender's risk in the community. This is not a question of satisfaction based on a proof beyond a reasonable doubt or any other standard of proof. Practical considerations will play a role in motivating both the Crown and the defence to provide whatever evidence will assist the court in determining whether a long term offender designation could be imposed."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to clear lumber for a job at the defendant's warehouse when the accident occurred. He entered the building from the back of the building intending to walk towards and through the glass doors to the lumber yard. However, when he entered the premises, he did not see anything located on the side of the desk, nor did he observe anything in the manner experts had described. As he walked along the front of the front desk, his knee became swollen with infection and he had to endure considerable pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident. He suffered a knee injury that restricted his activities for the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent, the following year and, to very limited extent, continues to the present. Awarding the plaintiff $8,500 for general damages, that there was nothing to indicate the defendant had implemented an adequate system or used reasonable care for his own safety. In the context of the present circumstances, it is clear that the presence of a 'cart', a dolly' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of the existence of such dollies within the premises. The defendant's premises were described as a commercial warehouse from which building supplies were sold. These circumstances were known to the plaintiff and as such he should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path as he proceeded towards the sliding glass doors. He did not use reasonable care."
c_1993canlii4476.txt,"The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them. Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","Plaintiffs and employees suing the former employer for breach of contract and/or misappropriation of pension funds were to be identified. The court found that the former president of the employer, under a very general retainer, acted as general counsel to the employer and was not related to any activity that occurred while he and his present partners and associates were involved. The latter was not the employer's client. The retainer alone did not create a conflict of interest. The applicants should have given the court some hint as to the type of information sought to be protected, without exposing the client to the dilemma described by the plaintiff."
9_2002nssc264.txt,"The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff company applied for a permanent injunction against Sobeys and a temporary injunction restraining its operations in the Shoppers Drug Mart shopping centre. The latter had a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the store. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the formation of a lease. Sobeis opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunctive relief at the required threshold, that neither the plaintiff nor the lesee had established irreparable harm. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than that of an interlocutory injunction. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), [1991] W.W.R. 712 (SCA), and Canada v. LeBlanc (1991), 1 S.C.A. 179 and 4C Concerned Citizens v. Cumberland (1997), S408/26 (NSSC). Both applications were brought in chambers. HELD: The application for the permanent injunction was dismissed on the ground that there was insufficient evidence for a final determination of the issues at trial. There would be no remedy for the plaintiff until the balance of convenience and convenience have been met. The factual complication of the receiver's case was to be assessed simply in light of the underlying lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms. 1) This is not a case where there is too little or too little of a procedural fairness for the average judge to take the final decision. 2) Rule 9.02 (b) is preclusive of an application where there was likely to be a substantial dispute of fact. 3) The Court has a discretion to order final judgment"

The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.

The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas, was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in terms of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of 5 years. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence: 1) she had no criminal record; 2) she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers; and 3) she seemed to be doing well in all programs in prison."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to comply with two provisions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and he fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was given a global fine of $1,000 to $2,000, which he was fined in the amount of $8,050. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the Court was required to take into account the defendant's own actions, which contributed to the hazard of working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. It was also required to consider if there were other mitigating factors which could be considered by the Court to consider in determining a fit and proper sentence. The defendants were fined $28,000 for failure to properly supervise, inspect and inspect the guardrails before work was commenced in that area. The fines were set-off against the defendant based upon the failure of the labourer to ensure that a mid-rail was constructed or installed as required by s. 7(1), 9(1)(b) and 9(2)(d) of the Act and in both cases, the defendant thereby committed an offence contrary to s. 74(1(a). The principles of proportionality and parity were examined in R. v. Eagles (2009 NSPC 49), which examined whether the defendant had any prior violations and whether he made an error in judgment in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof abovehang could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case."

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment deprived the accused of his right to make full answer and defence and to fair trial. It also found that, in the course of the trial, the defence counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving the accused to conduct his own defence. The issues were whether the judge's decision was based on reasons not wellfounded in law, whether the decision affected the accused's right to a fair trial and whether granting a trial adjournment would negatively affect the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice. Regarding the adjournment request, the Court found that there was nothing in the record which could legally support the presumption that counsel's absence was a premeditated scheme in complicity with the accused."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had taken parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling, and had placed the children in different adoptive homes because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency and that they had supported the applicants' aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the evidence presented was not sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order for the permanent care or to make a change in the children's lives. The children were placed in one home for adoption, and their parenting was abysmal. The parents had completed 35 sessions of anger management management training, which was not available through Family Services. The mother had completed nine parenting courses and had made significant improvements in the cleanliness of their home, including taking parenting courses. Although other parenting services were available, they were unlikely to benefit them sufficiently and the mother had not completed the program herself."

HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. The defendant argued that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen’s Bench Act, 1998. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant was to pay $20,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 2)The plaintiff did receive the first installment of $5,000 from the defendant. The remaining $15,000 was not paid to him nor had it been paid to his lawyer. 3)There was no suggestion that the settlement was amended or altered at that time. Nor did he suggest that the balance of money did not remain owing. 4)The enforceability of the settlement agreement can be determined by reading and interpreting its terms.  The defendant opposed the application solely on the basis that the plaintiff opposes the application.  5)Settlements of actions are encouraged in our courts for a great many years and it appears to me that the courts should be hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of settlements unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of a party or the minutes are too vague to enforce or are obviously incomplete. There is no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settling. There may, in certain circumstances, be exceptions where court will allow reference to be made to discussions, conversations and the like where such allegations are raised. do not have to decide that issue in this case. Nor is there any suggestion the signatures are not those of the parties' solicitors."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3(3(1)(d)(i) or the Survival of Actions Act as amended.  2) The plaintiff's claim of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty is equitable subject to the 6 year time limitation period prescribed by s3.1(h). 3) In any event, the limitation period stipulated that the claim should be struck on the basis that the claims relate to internal management of the Residential Schools and acts that were 'distinct and separate' from any public mandate. As such, the 12 month time limitation time is not applicable to these claims. 4) The plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the Crown pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada and Missionary Oblates-Grandin Province, 2002 SKQB 405 (Q.B.)."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and the Executive Committee of the League which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee also found that the appellant had misrepresented the substance of a report prepared by the former principal of the school, which was critical of his leadership. The latter was recommended to be transferred to a different school. The discipline committee imposed a fine of $2,500. The appellant was found guilty of one count of misrepresenting the report, of threatening the principal of another school and of threatening to fire him if he did not submit to a transfer request and resignation from the principalship. He received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) for professional misconduct and one count for threatening to shoot the principal and himself. The issues were whether the Committee erred in its finding of fact as set forth in the grounds of s. 3, 4 and 6 of the notice of appeal, if the facts were true, whether the appellant committed professional misconduct as set out in the relevant grounds of the claim and whether the imposition of a penalty was excessive as alleged in the ground of 7 of the Notice of Appeal."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant, who was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to confront the respondent. At that point the respondent pulled a knife and threatened the complainant. Eventually the respondent found the money underneath the complainant's bed and took it, taking the money with him. The appellant was 32 years old and had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for his conviction of 1992 for robbery, his parole was revoked, his service ended in 1995 and he was held on Remand until the date of sentencing in September 1995. HELD: Appeal allowed. Two years less one day concurrent on each charge was a sentence of more than the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences. Taking all of the factors into account, and even allowing some discount for the fact that the robbery occurred during the course of an illegal drug transaction, the sentences for each offence should be increased to three years imprisonment, with the sentences to be serve concurrently."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued the issuance was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant, arguing the issuance of the subpoenas was an abuse of process. The parties had agreed to a number of conditions, including that the defendant's representative be excluded from the discovery hearing and that there would be no communication between the plaintiff's witnesses and their solicitor. Further, the defendant argued that it had no control over the order in which the parties would be discovered as a result of the delay between July and September, when the proposed discovery dates fell through. Defendant sought to increase the tariff for party/party costs by $500, based on two factors: 1) the defendant had misrepresented its position on the discovery dates and there was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 2) the issuing of the discovery subpoena, which in effect dictated the order of witnesses, made exclusion a mute issue. Both parties agreed initially that Rule 18.16 was applicable. The prevailing practice is different (in the view of the Plaintiff's counsel) than what was suggested by the Defendant's counsel. There was no material delay by the defendant or its counsel in moving to discovery examinations. The use of discovery subpoena for this purpose was frowned upon and the appropriate practice would be to make motion to have that order determined or the exclusion of witnesses determined. In this case, the parties were trying to make arrangements for discovery in good faith and the plaintiff had taken the necessary steps to avoid conflict of interest by issuing the subpoena."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp) and the Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: 1) The application was cast as a request for restraining order under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of the Children’s Law Act and (f) that an order substituting a completely different parenting regime for the children would be in effect. 2) There was no evidence of alienation between the petitioner and the respondent. The children had primarily resided with the petitioner for the past four and a half years. The respondent had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order, given the short notice. The petitioner had little opportunity to do so. One option would be to adjourn the petitioner”s application to enable that to be done. There is no reason to believe that the children will be at any risk in the meantime.  3) An adjournment at this point would simply add to the time and cost of dealing with the problem to no particular end. It would be inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen‘s Bench Rules.” 4) The petitioner was granted interim parenting time on Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 pm and alternating weekends from 5:20 to 7:30 pm. 5) The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order. 6) The children were awarded interim primary residence with their mother. The mother was granted sole custody on alternating weekends. 7) The Court declined to grant an order respecting the interim parenting arrangements made by the parties. 8) On an interim basis, the application was adjourned. The Court was not able to find that the petitioner was attempting to “alienate” the children. It was not intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence available at trial."

He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand and gave him the usual Charter of Rights warning. The next day, the accused was observed entering a nearby building and driving off with his wife in his vehicle. At trial, the Crown argued that the accused had had two drinks at another location prior to entering the building and that he had taken some mints and cough drops while at the police station and before he took the two breathalyer tests. The accused appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the arrest was not random and was not made in good faith and was a deliberate breach of the accused's rights under s. 9 of the Charter. The police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion. They had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.

The accused had much different story. For example, he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge, even though he appreciated the candid evidence he gave, clearly understood that the accused's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.

c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.

The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that their motivation was financial gain and the fact their motivation were financial gain. HELD: The sentences imposed were 30 months, 5 months having already been served. 1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the “deal” phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. There were more extensive reasons to follow.  2) Each of the respondents was a high school student, had a broken home, was homeless and had no means of support.

d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants.

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)It is repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an interest which has heretofore been freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2)The plaintiff has been at a risk of being sued by the defendants because of the indefeasibility provisions of the land.

No reference to rent was reserved. 5)The option agreement was never intended to confer indefeasible titles on those who deal with the registered owner and deal with him on the faith of his registered title. It was apparent in this case that therent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years.

The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent incarceration was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included not only making sales contacts but co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in her employment contract. HELD: The appellant was awarded $60,000 for mental distress and $50,000 punitive. The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. The damages must flow from the inadequate notice and not from the act of dismissal."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant had made use of United States postal facilities and had to comply with postal regulations which required an address in the United States. In order to comply the defendant arranged for an address at 701-4th Avenue South in the City of Minneapolis. An address of this nature could be understood as connoting either residential or business address. But because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say, its activities in sales, the logical conclusion that it is a business address, the court found. 2)The case law have reviewed convinces me there is a real difference in the meaning of these terms and that the Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the plaintiff was carrying on business in Minnesota that same evidence does not support the conclusion. 3)Saskatchewan was not the only province where the word 'ordinarily resident' used in the Foreign Judgments Act. It was not suggested that s.3(a) or (b)(c) had application in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce a foreign judgment.  4)The plaintiff was served in Saskatoon with notice of the plaintiff's claim but didn't appear and defend the action or in any way submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court. The authorities have quoted support that approach. 5)Section 3(a)(b) has an application to Saskatchewan because the defendant manufactured solarium in the province of Saskatchewan which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota.  6)The court in Minnesota had jurisdiction in the following cases only: (a) where the defendant, when the judgment was obtained, is carrying onbusiness in that country; (c) where he submitted to jurisdiction of that court; or (d) by voluntarily appearing as defendant in the action without protest; (e) by having expressly or impliedly agreed to submit thereto."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer. The issues of liability and damages were severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants 57½% of the damages to be assessed, an amount which was not yet been determined by the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures. The defendants offered the services of rehabilitation specialist to the plaintiff in the amount of $168,000. This was predicated on the plaintiff's counsel's projection that his damages would likely be assessed in the final analysis at something in excess of one million dollars (less 42½% for contributory negligence). The plaintiff's actuarial report quantifies the past loss of income at approximately $216,000 using a valuation date of June 1, 2000. This head of damage has a much higher degree of certainty of recovery, subject to any arguments of mitigation which the defendants might develop. The evidence to support the validity of this claim was far from complete at this stage and the defendants had offered the rehabilitation specialist a sum of $20,000, which was incorporated into the order accordingly. The claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the plaintiff did not yet even form part of the pleadings."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction on a charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the trial judge in Colonsay misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The only reasonable inference that can draw is that the stolen that the accused stole the generator. 2)The conviction was properly supported by the evidence. The fact that the respondent was an employee of SaskPower does not necessarily make the conviction unreasonable. However, if recent possession is not relied upon as the sole evidence connecting the accused with the crime, then possession should be considered as circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly.  3)The trial judge did not provide adequate reasons for the conviction. He relied on the case law of R. v. Sheppard, [2002] S.C.R. 869, decision of the Supreme Court delivered by Binnie J. In this case the procedural irregularity is not subject to s. 822(7) pertaining to defect to which the accused has not objected."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The parties were married in 1994 and were university graduates and teachers. The petitioner had been employed as a substitute teacher in Richmond until the time of their son's birth when she became a full-time homemaker. The mother had been residing in Regina for three months during which time she moved on two occasions. The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia, and the substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in that jurisdiction. HELD: 1)I was not satisfied that the children were habitually resident in Saskatchewan. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. He delayed in bringing an application for custody in British Columbia because of his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation, although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home. On the other hand, the children have only been resident here for approximately 3 months, duringwhich time they have moved on 2 occasions. There is no evidence about the schooling of the son, nor of the career plans of the petitioner, and of the care to be provided to the two children while she may be out of the home working. It is likely that his teacher, playmates, aunts, school professionals and others, including the petitioner's psychologist, may be called to testify about facts and circumstances bearing on the best interests of the young children. 2)There was no evidence of schooling or of the professional, social and family circumstances of the child particularly those of Saskatchewan, except that the mother had moved with the children to her grandmother's residence several weeks ago. It would be appropriate to require the petitioner to travel to Ontario to provide that evidence."

The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available. Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","The appellants sought better particulars of general damages (Civil Procedure Rule 14.24) in an interlocutory order dismissing their application for further particulars of the general damage claim. The respondent had purchased the property in 1996 and used it for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation. The appellants claimed that because the property was materially less than the size represented in the notice, its plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected. The respondents claimed a breach of contract because the appellants misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property they sold to the respondent. They applied to a Chambers judge for an order compelling a substantive response to the demand. Dismissing the appeal with costs of $1500 inclusive of disbursements, that the Chambers judge erred at law. When particulars are demanded before a Defence has been filed, such are generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed with costs. Both appeals and cross appeals are dismissed. While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and at the same time, recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major cause of his present medical problems, the trial court assessed the appellant’s evidence to be lacking in credibility. The medical evidence, she determined, did not support the appellants position that there was no other reason for his present problems but the accident in question. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. HELD: In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court (1) that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; and (4) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on a balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief. In the circumstances, the parties' agreement may give to a decree of specific enforcement an effect that had not been anticipated and might be oppressive and consequently the court, which has to make and enforce the order, can never relinquish ultimate control and responsibility for it."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims that he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) On the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that the Longard brothers divided the land and each occupied their respective lots, they both knew that they were using the driveway and the garden with their consent and that the property belonged to them. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as the driveway running proximate to their residence and accessing the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds. There was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff as to its use. Roy Longard did not show that the reservation contained in the 1942 deed to the extent that it incorporated the driveway. He claimed that the plaintiff had a 'prescriptive right of way' within the meaning of the Act. 2) This permission extended by Borden to Eldred and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross 'the Borden road' created by a prescription or lost grant. 3) The defendant's claim that the right of access to the existing driveway was not expressed in the deed was not rebutted. It was accepted that the defendant had a reasonable and consistent track record as to access the property from the highway. 4) The plaintiff was not able to locate the respondent's residence or contact him at times proxim to the signing. The Court found that it would be impossible for the defendant to locate his property."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. The Court found the accused not guilty of the offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act, which is a strict liability offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highwaymen or highway equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour.

One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator, and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act.

His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form with handwritten portions indicating the disposition of his assets.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This is an appeal, pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997.

The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the applicant received an accident injury settlement from SGI. In the alternative, the plaintiff Bankers' counter-claimed against the Royal Bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. HELD: 1)None of the counter-claimants' claims were upheld and they were dismissed in total. 2)The plaintiff Royal Bank did not breach its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or its duty of confidentiality to Ronald Compain. It was not acceptable to the defendant with the result that he refused to pay his loans. 3)The Royal Bank expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement it authorized the Royal bank to release to Equifax the information which it did. 4)In the alternative the defendant Royal Bank was prepared to advise the Credit Bureau of Canada that the default occurred as a result of Mr. Compain's serious car accident, which resulted in his having settled his debt.

2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired operation of a motor vehicle. The court found as a fact that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 a.m. Both officers were adamant that they had the vehicle in their sight at all times, from the time the individuals got into the vehicle until they left the bar, at which point the vehicle started to back up. The entire incident took mere seconds and the entire charge was dismissed. 1)The defence did not accept that evidence nor did it leave the court with a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the defendant. The officer was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the defence witness caused the court to have considerable concern. 2)There were a number of inconsistencies in the evidence of the two police officers. The first officer, who was driving the police truck, was found to be somewhat evasive on the main points of the evidence. The time lines were considerably different from time lines given by the other officer. The police officer thought it was approximately 11:30 or 1:30 p.m., four hour difference from the police vehicle's first contact. The events of that night were a bit of blur.

His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. HELD: 1) The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 2) Kailey had settled in well with the parents and was doing well with school activities. However, she was separated from her psychological parent. 3) There were negative consequences involved in moving to the Archerwill district. Access to his father and his sister became more problematic and travel arrangements more difficult. The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. 4) The only viable options at this time are to permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to Archerwill or to place him in the home of Rocky. Shauna has foreclosed the option of returning to the Kindersley district. Too many irreversible events have taken place. In any event it would not necessarily serve Tyson's best interests to order that Shauna be entitled to retain Tyson's primary residence only by returning to that district. 5) There are negative consequences in changing Tyson's permanent residence. He would be separated from his psychological parent less able to provide for his special needs and away from his friends and family. That will be disruption to him."

He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system. What the appellant did was distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area designated as Hacker's Delight available only to persons granted special status and were not where any caller would become aware of them without J.PM's permission. It was clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner by which the users accessed their computer boards and providing the software to assist in the downloading by modem by those users, the appellant was also distributing, that is giving out, or sharing the infringing copy. The evidence accepted by the trial judge was that the programs were'scrambled' so that they could not be copied or downloaded by the callers, the evidence was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of transmission'. No error was raised in reviewing the evidence."

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.

Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

In an action for professional negligence against a solicitor for failing to obtain specific security requested in written instructions, the plaintiff renegotiated the deal and no longer insisted upon receiving the specific security. That the plaintiff was estopped from exercising any rights against the solicitor under the original instructions.","This was an action for professional negligence against the defendant, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. For the plaintiff, that the defendant had breached the terms of a mortgage loan by renegotiating a deal with the Langille farmers and giving up the original security. The terms of the loan offered were semi-annual payments of 1237 litres per day. The plaintiff was to supply the lenders with a valid milk assignment to repay the mortgage loan. At this point a new deal was made between the parties, with the loan being secured by a mortgage on real estate, and the lenders accepting the loan. When the loan was secured by the mortgage, the defendant and the plaintiffs negotiated a deal, and then several years later, held the defendant responsible under the original deal. The defendant brought this action against the plaintiff on the basis of estoppel.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 (the PST) on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties. The parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government of Saskatchewan to the extent that the PST collected and remitted by the plaintiff was improperly collected and paid. The applicant was awarded interest on the amount claimed. The court found that even if the Government was entitled to payment of the PST from the plaintiff, the third party contractors owed the Saskatchewan Government PST in undetermined amounts on materials supplied to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argued that the claim was barred by s.50(4) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and s.56(5) of the Saskatchewan Tax Act, as the portion of the claim barred by virtue of the expiration of the limitation period in the claim, the plaintiff is entitled to refund of the sales tax it paid to the government.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and for operating a motor vehicle when his blood level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. At trial the Crown tendered a certificate of analysis establishing that the accused was impaired by alcohol or drug, and an affidavit of service by Constable L. P. Weber was tendered in evidence establishing that a 'true copy of the certificate' had been served upon the accused. HELD: The accused was granted a new trial. 1)The trial judge had further advanced the law to a point where even when notchallenged there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison, etc. in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. 2)The Court was unable to infer that a true copy was served, failing the proof by the police officer by way of his testimony that he did compare the two. The Court held this to be an error of law. Prosecutions of this type are not infrequent and when a police officer completes the affidavit of a service his memory is fresh. As time passes between that moment and the trial of the action it is reasonable to expect his specific recollection of one particular set of copies may dim and so the affidavit must be at least as reliable as his recollection of the events some weeks or months later. It would not be unreasonable to require that if there is to be a challenge under this subsection orof the affidavit or of the copy supplied, it should be based upon a discovereddifference as between the copy and the original.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","Two female employees of a unionized employer filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in their employment contrary to the collective agreement.

During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.

They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The applicants had entered into a written sub-lease with VIP in 1992 which leased 8,787 square feet of office space to it for term of 5 years. By this time, the head lessee had defaulted on his rent and immediately sought to re-enter the premises. VIP applied for and obtained an order pursuant to s.21 of the head lease which bound the City with its terms of its sublease. Bennett refused to pay the outstanding rent and offered to rent the premises to the applicants for a term of less than one clear month, which would be for the shorter period provided in Golden Griddle's sub lease. The applicant submitted the application was properly before the Court because they proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos.3 and 4 could dispose of theapplication and perhaps the issues between the parties. Therefore, the court will address them. 2)The actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of s.4, regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine is applied.  3)VIP and the applicants fall below the essential requirements for valid renewals and subleases in order to comply with s. 4 of the Statute of Frauds. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this court than tenants concerning possession of demised premises. 4)The applicants were awarded costs."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in front of a mall when the officers approached him. They noted a strong smell of burned marijuana coming from the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and noted that he was smoking a cigarette. They asked him where the cigarette was and he told them that it was from the inside of the vehicle. The officer did not detect the smell of marijuana from her person and the officer smelled strong, fresh smell of the marijuana on the accused. They arrested him and searched him and found no drugs or alcohol on his person. They also found no section 10(b) violation prior to the accused giving his statement to the police. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marijuana will be present. The Crown contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the defence. The facts were not in dispute. Both the defence and the Crown presented evidence that, in appropriate circumstances, the Court may accept as a reasonable inference that the accused is in possession of marijuana. However, detention from the point of first contact has not been proven. There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative, the officer had no special training and she was able to distinguish between a smell of burnt marijuana and smoke, and the accused appeared tired, spoke slowly and was very quiet. The evidence did not establish that he had recently smoked a marijuana cigarette. Although there were other possible explanations, none of which supported the existence of a police duty to advise the accused of his rights at the time of the search."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and instead filed a requisition with the clerk of the county pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant was awarded costs of $3,000. 1)Armoyan was entitled to continue its ditch to a 'proper outlet' pursuant to the Act and required the consent of the adjacent property owners.  2)The applicant was not entitled to construct a ditch or drain across the Haverstock estate. Rather, the applicant was ordered to design, install, and maintain a ditch and drain. 3)Full compliance with the provisions of the Expropriation Act was required.  4)If the applicant has the means to take over the management of the drainage, the award of costs will make no order for costs either for or against the applicant."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the respondent's counterclaim is allowed. 1) The trial judge was of the view that the phrase 'farmout agreement' is equivalent to way of describing a'reversionary interest' and the parties reached an agreement in principle. The only matter to be resolved was for the parties to satisfy themselves that Tarragon had good title. 2) The lease was not void by reason of common law rule 21. Rather, it was best left to the legislature to decide whether the lease breached that rule. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3) The evidence established that there are hundreds of 'top leases' in this province. Tens of thousands of leases in various stages of development, from exploration to production, all of which have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to their vesting, to being retained within the meaning of the rules of construction. The phrase 'in the event' connotes time and condition and not property or an interest in property. That uncertainty precluded the parties from simply proceeding on their own. 4) In this case, the plaintiffs were awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the respondent and one half of the common law shares."

He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT.

The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386 which is what he had been earning. HELD: 1) The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s.19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175). 2) A trial of the issue was directed by the local registrar in consultation with counsel."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, they brought an amended motion for stay that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area and an increased seven year habitation requirement offended the sensibilities of the plaintiffs. They also brought a motion to compel the municipality to certify the coke ovens and steel plant. At issue was whether the municipality should pay the cost of the certification hearing. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs of $1,000.  1)This appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the municipality. Rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. If the certification is struck, the municipality will still face individual claims, first filed in 2004, involving similar issues. 2)Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court. Neither the province nor the plaintiffs had established their fourth assumption that there would be only one Notice, published after the Court of Appeal's decision. There is no evidence of how the Province would incur expenses for its pleading or document disclosure that would be significantly higher because of the points that are in issue on the appeal. 3)If the municipality succeeds in its appeal, the public would observe a decision of lower court altered by an appeal court. That is par for the course of appellate litigation, not irreparable harm. 4)The municipality would be able to assess the merits of the municipality's appeal and the costs to the province. 5)Costs to the municipality could not be determined on their face. The municipality would have incurred additional, wasted and taxable litigation expense that exceeds the plaintiffs' proven equity $373,400.  6)There was no evidence that the municipality would suffer the same embarrassment and embarrassment that would result if the stay were granted and, if the appeal was successful, the province would be entitled to an award of costs."

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada Inc. and experienced periods of layoff for as long as 2 years. In 1993, he was laid off full-time hourly employment. He was given part-time casual employment, which included one eight hour day per month. He sustained a back injury in which he was unable to continue with his caretaking duties. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision and order of the Chambers judge were set aside. 1)The interpretation of the Hearing Officer of s. 37 of the Act limited the Board's jurisdiction. The Chambers judge held that the interpretation by the hearing officer was one which was subject to review for correctness and the Board had thus exceeded its jurisdiction. 2)On appeal the Board was remitted to determine whether the Act limits its jurisdiction or if s.37 does not limit it."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. This contract was arranged to be performed by using the services of an individual he knew as a 'employer' who was hired to do the backhoe work on the excavation. The contract stipulated that the defendant was to pay wages on an hourly basis according to the defendant and had no prospect of making profit on the job. When the contract fell apart, the defendant, who had been the foreman of the contract, arranged for his nephew to work with him to assist him in laying the pipe. The nephew was not performing the job as the defendant intended but was responsible for the rest of the work. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility.  1)Once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure the usual protocols for job safety are met. At minimum this would have required the presence of an experienced person on site. 2)If the defendant did have an obligation to discharge it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to leave it to another court on another day when the issue may be central to the outcome of the case to carefully consider the matter and to rule in an authoritative and precedentially significant manner at that time."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, claiming that the applicant's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime. The applicant argued that to limit cross-examination in this manner would constitute a breach of natural justice. She also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a court order which granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and interim custody of the child of the marriage to her estranged husband. In issue was whether the respondent authorized the applicant to cross-examine her on numerous occasions during the course of her taxation hearing; whether the applicant authorized the respondent to make such an appearance on her behalf and, in particular, whether she was aware of the legal issues at hand. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The respondent was entirely unsuccessful in establishing any negligence on the part of the appellant, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, and focused on the reasonableness of her legal accounts rather than on vexatious questioning. 2)There was very little in the Small Claims Court Act that specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court. Section 6(6) of the Act provides that decision makers, when appointed, must take and subscribe an oath before judge of the Supreme Court whereby the Adjudicator promises to do right to all manner of people after the laws of the Province without fear, favour, affection or ill will. There is a strong presumption in favour of judicial impartiality and the presumption is that such an oath as that made by an adjudicator at the outset of his or her appointment will be respected by that adjudicator. Such prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension of bias."

The appellant contended that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to have affected the respondent's residence. He candidly conceded that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to add fresh evidence. 1)The tests to be introduced by the Court of Appeal were well known and the application was denied.

Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as a custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues arose in the context of a divorce action. 2)Each parent was a capable caregiver. 3)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for Sophie and exhibits a very strong desire todo so. 4)Each party was awarded joint custody with the express purpose of demonstrating that the child's needs require a better understanding of her needs and the world in which she is born. 5)Each child was to start the Buckwold Centre program in the fall of 1996 with the full support of her parents. The custody order was upheld and the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. 6)There was no convincing evidence to suggest that the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne had any bearing on the decision to grant custody to the applicant. It was only relevant in the instant case if it affected his ability to parent the child."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child, with access to her former spouse; (2) interim child support in the sum of $700 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006; (3) interim spousal support in $750 per month. HELD: 1) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. Therefore, child support shall commence in April 2006 inasmuch as the petitioner pays $625 per month and 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described. 2) The parties agreed that the need and corresponding ability to pay are predominant considerations at the interim stage, yet not to the exclusion of the statutory factors and objectives recited by the Divorce Act and Family Maintenance Act. However, the petitioner is no longer expected to contribute $80 per month to service family debt. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spOUSal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code; and with driving over.08, contrary with s.253(a). The accused was co-operative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. However, the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot was not reliable evidence of impairment. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. On the evidence, the accused walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. Therefore, he was not guilty of the offence of impaired driving.  2) In all criminal cases, the trial judge must be satisfied that, prior to convicting the accused, he's satisfied that his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug. If the evidence is so frail as to leave him with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, he must be acquitted. The accused's rights under s.9 of the Charter were breached and the evidence obtained from that breach should be excluded. 3) The nature and quality of the impairment assessed by the officer was so reliable that he was able to observe it in the absence of reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. In this case, the Court found that the accused was not in a state of intoxication sufficient to establish a breach of the rights of the accused under ss.8 and s.8 of the Code to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. The admission of the certificate of analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. 4) In respect to the admissibility of evidence, in v. Stellato (1994), [1994] 31 CR (4th) 60, in which the Supreme Court of Canada approved the following observations: 5) The officer was at the scene with the accused for approximately fifteen minutes and that ultimately the accused provided breath samples of 160 milligrams and 150 milligram at 2:56 a.m. and 3:17 a."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The husband applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Access Judgment in May 2001. The husband had initially applied for sole custody, but alleged ongoing conflict had adversely impacted the children. The wife had agreed to an assessment and to the assessors in February 2004. There were thirteen recommendations made in the assessment report, all of which led to the husband seeking sole custody. He relied on the assessment to implement the recommendations. The mother, who wished to continue the shared parenting arrangement, alleged she had been unable to relax into the children's individual needs and to fully adjust her principles accordingly. HELD: The children's best interests were to be placed in the primary care and custody of their father. 1)The father was to forthwith implement all recommendations of the Court ordered assessment.  2)The mother's position was that she wished to retain a child psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist who had been retained by the husband. 3)The assessment report reflected a different view on the parents' ability to be flexible in hearing, understanding and integrating the individual emotional needs of the children and was in no way impacted upon the credibility of the assessment or the assessor."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant applied to admit into evidence the transcript of the first trial and an affidavit of the appellant's former babysitter, which outlines discussions between the appellant and his counsel prior to and during the second trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in sentencing youth to a high sentence. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant, he has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 3) The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 4) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. A trial judge must establish the facts, including the acts or omissions of trial counsel, upon which the claim of incompetence is based. Second, the appellant must establish that the representation provided by the trial judge was incompetent. The appeal must be dismissed. 5) The evidentiary onus on an appellant alleging incompetent counsel was outlined in Short (2012 SKCA 85). An appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by trial level court in only two circumstances. The first is when the sentence is demonstrably unfit. The second is when it is unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA)."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman born in 1920. He lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan for many years and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with a Mrs. Essex. He now sought to have the land registered in his name. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The land was vested directly in the name of the petitioner. 2)The court found that the petitioner was capable of managing his affairs and that some of the proceeds from the sale should be placed in the hands of the Public Trustee as his property guardian. 3)As there were no facts in dispute and there was no other reasonably convenient remedy, the court granted the vesting order. The land was to be provided directly to the petitioner to be dealt with by him as he chooses. The public trustee was to administer the funds in accordance with the normal powers and procedures of the court."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) In its view, the applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Act. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. To read the word 'election' in the section as anything other than referring to the election of director or auditor requires interpretive contortions beyond my ability. 3) In Abrahamson v.

He complains about the manner in which the activities of the corporation have been conducted. The authority in s.225(2) gives the court the necessary power to address such wrongs and are sufficiently broad so as to subsume an order declaring a referendum of no force or effect. 5) In B.C.S.C.'s jurisdiction the court must first determine what approach it should take in the context of overturning a vote. In this case CFS was advised and at that juncture both USC and CFS assumed the table had been set for the Saskatchewan Student Federation to become part of CFS. 6) The respondent is considered to be the ultimate decision maker in this case.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs.

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had just bought pizza for the girls. The parties had retired to the living room where they all sat and watched television. During the evening, the complainant awoke and felt something in her pyjamas. She did not see the accused touch her, but rather heard him lean over and kiss her on the breast and then move to the window on the opposite side of the bed. When the girls finished watching a movie, the accused and the complainant retired to their respective bedrooms to watch television. He never entered the bedroom nor did the complainant's parents' home. Upon assessing the total evidence, it was concluded that the complainant could not, without doubt, state that in reality, what she experienced was the accused actually touching her vagina with his hands. HELD: The accused was found not guilty as charged. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the Court was not persuaded that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt, on the Information tried before me, that he sexually assaulted the complainant or for a sexual purpose, or at all."

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act.

It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between the child and the extended families of either parent. The father was not notified of the application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Act. The Minister did not make any recommendation regarding the adoption and did not conduct a home study. The chambers judge refused to grant the application on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with her father whether the adoption was granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R offered the plaintiff a car for his daughter. The plaintiff purchased the vehicle for $1,600. He was not satisfied that the vehicle was unsafe from the outset. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The consignee was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly was deemed to have given the plaintiff's vehicle a reasonable period of time. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and were properly recoverable. 2)The plaintiff did not reject the vehicle. The dealer was not negligent in failing to establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions.  3)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties applied to partition and sale of a lake front recreational property owned by them and their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another property that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed over and above the contributions of the others. Ronald claims that he has made improvements to the property that have made it more convenient for the parties to share in the maintenance and improvements. They also claim that they have received a fair share of the proceeds from the sale. HELD: 1) The Court's discretion to refuse partition under s. is limited. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious or oppressive. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons; the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the Respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%.  3) There must be a reasonable expectation that the parties will realize their capital value. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. It is precisely where an injustice arises without a legal remedy that equity finds role. 4) In seeking partition, the Court has discretion to grant an order which would cause inconvenience and hardship to the defendant but, if it thinks fit, to direct Sale of the Property. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of the property; and in the latter case, to order Valuation of the Share of the Party requesting Sale in such Manner as the Court thinks fit."

The reasonableness of the notice must be decided with reference to each case, having regard to the character of the employment, the length of service of the employee, the age of the person and the availability of similar employment, having respect to the experience, training and qualifications of the individual. Damages in this case were $2,946.00 per month, $1,325.00 for the period of 9 months and $310.93 for holiday pay 2,334.93."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 129 for an order granting the plaintiff summary judgment for the sum of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the court is in agreement that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in this case does represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. There is no dispute as to the nature of her investment in the defendant corporation and the amount claimed as due."
d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. It was at this time that the appellant began to become aware of the company's real financial situation. He had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. Consequently, he could not be placed in his original position merely by returning the purchase price. The trial judge determined that the trial judge had correctly calculated the damages, prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the business was less than what the appellant paid for it. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to $1,800,000, representing lost return on investment opportunities for 7 years.  In assessing the damages for breach of a contractual warranty, it is impossible to perform that reconstruction. There are too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence, presumably because the parties were satisfied that an attempt to unravel the transaction and establish the clients' position on the assumption that the transaction had not occurred was so complicated as to defy performance."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance under the Matrimonial Property Act, and custody of the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching business was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. In the meantime the respondent spent alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than should have been required. He was in arrears for the two younger children who were under the age of 8. HELD: 1)The respondent was responsible for the family finances and the finances from 1977 to 1981. He did not lose his licence and did not miss work because of his consumption of alcohol. 2)He was entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle and his tools in his possession as his own and to keep household goods and household goods in the possession of his wife in the amount of $1,800 for total of $18,240. 3)The applicant was to have her name and the address of the respondent for the purposes of the exhibit in her name.  4)Allowing the application and leaving the matter to the trial judge, that the respondent had not dissipated the property within the meaning of the Property Act and that he was to pay the Arrears of child support to the applicant and repay the half-brother of the deceased for the purpose of leaving the property to rot in the lot."

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator asked that a hearing be ordered to prove her last will and testament in solemn form. She also asked that an order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate of the testator without leave of the court, until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. HELD: 1) The testator was appointed as his personal and property Power of Attorney. The executor of the November 3, 2005 will filed his affidavit. 2) There was a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089. It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses. 3) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last Will and testament. The question to be tried is whether the defendant at the time of execution of the will was subjected to undue influence. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to have viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application. 4) The respondent shall be the plaintiff and shall bear the burden of establishing the deceased's knowledge and approval of the contents of the Will.

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was a 61 year old single male suffering from epilepsy who lived in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one of which was for a sexual assault which involved touching the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching the victim's spouse or common-law partner and touching her inappropriately. The complainant was on social assistance at the time of the offences and had a back problem which prevented him from gaining employment. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused's record at a low risk to re-offend, given his previous criminal record and the fact that the victims were children. HELD: 1)Three years was the appropriate starting point for the sexual assault as it was a singular incident and the accused was not in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. The fact that this was a single incident of sexual touching that occurred over a few seconds gave rise to the idea that the accused, who had two prior convictions for sexual interference, was a high risk to offend again, even where he was without a criminal record. The appropriate range of sentence for R. v. Revet, 2010 SKCA 71, is a comparison between a sentence for fleeting touching and one for sexual assaults upon women who were incapable of giving consent due to being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or sleep, or combinations thereof. 2)Three is the appropriate sentence in the circumstances. This case is instructive for cases involving brief sexual contact over clothing. The Crown and defence both filed cases setting out various sentences. At the time the accused committed these offences, he was sentenced to 14 months incarceration followed by 12 months probation. A conditional sentence order was not available in this case."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure of the complainant statements. HELD: 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of the respondent's failure to provide copies of certain disclosure material to the accused.  2)The Court was of the view that disclosure in criminal proceedings is now constitutionally required by the Charter to be done in a manner that respects the privacy and safety of the complainants. To do so would fall short of acting responsibly as an officer of the court. 3)The accused contended that his rights pursuant to s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d) were violated. The judge specifically contemplated the giving of an undertaking by defence counsel. 4)The respondent was restricted by the court to giving disclosure to the public. 5)The court was not able to determine whether the imposition of trust conditions would adversely affect the accused's ability to make full answer and defence. The fact that the accused had been charged with mischief did not affect his right to a fair trial."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer did not have a conflict of interest and that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because they had a mutual understanding of the terms of the agreement and that they would be unable to collaterally interfere with the plaintiff's attempts to sell her personal care home. There was no delay in the application.
e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, two counts of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented by the defendant, who was senior and more experienced in the trade, being at large on his recognizances. The defendant claimed the complainant had pushed him to buy cocaine, and that he had physically prevented her from doing so each time. During the events at the hotel, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant and the defendant was acquitted. The elements required for self-defence were not present on either charge. The accused was a large, very muscular man with a large build and was of the opinion that the complainant was the driving force in obtaining cocaine. He was described as being very level-headed and had a very muscular frame. His assertion that cocaine affected the complainant's behaviour makes little sense when the drugs were consumed the previous day. However, his repeated assertion that she was in 'cocaine psychosis' and his concern about same does not explain his reaction to her mental state. There was no requirement that the defendant measure his force to a nicety and the force used was excessive. On these facts, it is clear to the defendant that he knew she was trying to leave the hotel and that she had been savagely attacked by him minutes earlier. The Crown has proven each required element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","A motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness.

The actions of the corporate president and his supporters were directed to be set aside. 2)The applicant was ordered, pursuant to s. 234(2) of the Business Corporations Act, to remove the president and CEO of the corporation and to take appropriate steps to consolidate its operations and to prevent the directors from voting in any capacity other than those authorized by the shareholders' agreement. 3)The director was to be directed to withdraw from Saskatoon and any employees or contractors who had obtained written consent to move to or from the municipality may be compelled to conspire with him to prevent this from occurring."

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She refused to cooperate with the Trustee on this application and argued that they were assets of the estate and that she should be compensated for the loss of her household goods which were taken from her in the past. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. The evidence at the hearing was that she did not. 2)She had little time to make arrangements. She incurred expenses in moving. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. 3)There are other ways to determine surplus income, such as under the Judicature Act or under the Civil Procedure Rules whereby this information might have been obtained and possibly may now be obtained. There was ample time for this to have been addressed.  4)It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or character or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. It is not the policy of the law to convert into money for creditors the mental or physical anguish of the bankrupt. Put another way, the creditors are not entitled to benefit from that which the bankrupt receives to make whole her injured body, mind or reputation. 5)In the circumstances, the respondent's obligation to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months to 12 months is not unreasonable. The Court reviewed the various types of surplus income and found that most of the surplus income should be paid to the respondent. The respondent should be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible. 6)Costs of storage for sale would mean very little when one confronts the market. The pension should not be considered in calculating surplus income."

Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in order to quash the defendant's attempts to operate a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of driving while disqualified and failure to provide a breath sample. 1)The accused had been member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years. He was on general patrol duty in his police vehicle which was proceeding westbound on Broad Street against a red light. As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street, they observed a driver on a moped enter the intersection against red light and proceed towards the intersection. The motor vehicle was not operating as defined by the Criminal Code and the accused should be acquitted of the impaired driving charge. 2)The police officer testified that he saw the accused pedalling his bike with both of his feet close to the ground rather than resting on the floor as the motor powered the bike. He testified that the accused had appeared to steady himself, dismounted the moped and stumbled backwards toward a wall adjacent to the roadway. The Crown had not proven that either the accused or the accused were impaired by alcohol or drug. It was not established that the second opinion of the police officer was based on whether the third opinion was correct or whether the fourth opinion was incorrect."
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","HELD: The accused were released from detention after a show cause hearing. There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. The accused had been in custody since November 2004. Their detention at the time of their arrest was being held on outstanding charges and arrest warrants in Manitoba and Alberta and drug related charges in Alberta. Their release was denied because the judge refused to release the accused for the same reasons. Although only 21 years of age, the accused had a significant youth court record; six convictions involving breaking and entering and theft, one for failing to comply with a disposition and recognizance; one charge of being unlawfully at large; and one for being in the habit of travelling farther than 100 km from the City of Regina without consent in writing to the officer in charge or his designate, Drug Section, Division, RCMPolice."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. of the Charter. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the acquitted accused. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the ASD demand on the accused. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1) The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing it. 2) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion and the evidence was reliable, relevant and necessary for the Crown's case.  3) It found the officer, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand the accused provide incriminating evidence against himself' (R. v. Gunn, 2012 SKCA 80)."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","This appeal against sentence must be allowed. The offence is a breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.

The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The question is whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff, or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)In the event the mother is not liable, the school board is unable to find in favour of the father. In the event there is an apparent conflict between the two statutes the School Board is immune. 2)The mother's immunity under the Education Act extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 3)There is no apparent conflict with the statutes. The legislation provides that a negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity if the teacher has acted within the scope of s.228 of the Act. 4)The school board was not in any danger of being sued by the mother as long as the action is commenced by the employer."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent eventually countered with an application for variation in March 2004. The respondent seeks an upward variation of child support for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984. The parties agree that much of their income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. It is self-evident that the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the children than does the respondent."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.",This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. It was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal. There was no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process. The Tribunal has made an error of jurisdiction as to its powers on an appeal from the Hearing officer.

The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues.

Peter neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  2)In the circumstances the fact the plaintiff did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land on his behalf does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. By his own conduct he did nothing to obtain payment for his labour while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 3)The quantum of the damages was $6,500 and the plaintiff's costs against the estate on a party and party basis for the portion of his claim which was successful and for defending the counterclaim."
b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child remained in need of protection and the Minister ordered that the child be placed in the grandmother's custody as a person of sufficient interest for a period of 4 months. This was a sad case as most proceedings under the Child and Family Services Act are. We have two very young parents who want to care for their child. The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child and, if so, if physical or emotional harm is likely to occur to this child. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested in the Minister's report. Given the nature of the threats and the parents' failure to cooperate with them regarding when the baby was to be picked up, it is reasonable that the parents would have thought that this child was seriously abused by her youthful parents. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act for threatening to kill anyone who entered the home or touched the child or disturbed them while they were in the process of parenting. The mother's relationship with the father was poor and she did not have a positive relationship with him. She was unable to parent the child for long periods of time. There was no evidence that either of the parents were able to parent. The plan put forward by TK would have placed the child in the custody of the grandmother but for the fact that it would allow the parents to have more access to the child and to allow them to begin programming with the child, that would have resulted in a more positive relationship."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for two children. The father was currently employed as a roofer but was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at risk of exposure to violence and intimidation by the father as they were in the care of his current partner. As well, the mother's past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication has compromised his emotional bond with the children. HELD: 1)Primary care should be maintained for the children but with a change of primary care provision of the order. 2)The father was convicted of criminal charges and was awaiting sentencing. The mother's plan was well conceived but the execution of her plan caused concern for the court as it was unclear if the mother could withstand the daily pressure of raising two active boys, especially when this was coupled with the ongoing strain of poor relations with the father. 3)The mother's actions were found to have had an adverse effect on the children's short and long term care. The long term stability of the children could not be assured if placed back in her primary care and control."

The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial.

He had been given several accommodations by the court, including allowing his friend to sit with him, provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigant, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side.

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in Nova Scotia. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) To succeed on their survival of actions claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate and be enforceable by his personal representative against the defendant. The appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The proper remedy is for the estate to recover damages for loss of expectation of life. 3) In this case, the Court adopted the appropriate interpretation of the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act (which excluded causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his spouse).  4) In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these provisions, the court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation as well as admissible external aids."

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce.

HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. 1) Rule 62.15 has no application in this case because the decision of the respondent was merely declaratory and does not call for or contemplate any consequential relief or require the taking of any further steps to enforce his declaration. There simply are no 'proceedings under the order appealed from' to be stayed. 2) There is no comprehensive definition of 'exceptional circumstances' for Fulton's secondary test. It applies only when required in the interests of justice and it is exceptional in the sense that it permits the court to avoid an injustice in circumstances which escape the attention of the primary test. Here there are no proceedings that follow from the judgment of Campbell, J. which could be the subject of a stay. His decision is merely declarate as to the state of the law. There is nothing that has to be done to enforce or to give effect to the decision itself which has already been rendered. 3) The jurisdictional uncertainties and the child's best interests present exceptional circumstances. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice. 4) Costs of this application will be in the cause."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain.

However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The bankrupt and the bankrupt were both practicing medicine together in Wolseley and both had filed in bankruptcy in 1995. Each had a large unsecured creditor, Revenue Canada, which required payment of $1,250 per month to apply to the bankrupt. Both doctors were 51 and 49 years of age with seven children, all of whom were studying for undergraduate or post-graduate university degrees. The bankrupt had been poor business managers. HELD: The consent judgment option under s.172(2)(c) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they served. 1)The bankrupt's monthly family income after-tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $3,349 per month for the benefit of creditors. 2)If the bankrupt consented to judgment there would be ajudgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000 for a total of 36 months.  3)The judgment was not enforced so long as the bankrupt pays to the trustee the sum of $ 1,250.00 per month on the first day of each and every month for a TOTAL OF 36 MONTHS.  4)The trustee was to apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time among the unrepresented creditors.  5)In respect of the bankrupt, the trustee was awarded an absolute discharge."

Both parties bore costs, which included disbursements and pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. The defendant sought $10,000 in trial costs, $850 in previously awarded costs, and $5,092.57 in disbursement and prejudgment interest for total of $26,630.81. It was important that courts support Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial.

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were found to have either one or more bent web members or were not compliant with the National Building Code. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the mall. The defendant, based in Sydney, claimed that the repairs were necessary but the reinforcing of the joists was not necessary to repair the defects. Awarding the defendant $7,000 for the remediation costs, that the respondents had not been properly trained in the welding trade and that the respondent had not conducted proper quality control. The court was concerned that the quality of the work performed by the respondent was not satisfactory and that necessary repairs were not being undertaken to alleviate the danger. Regarding the respondent's claim that the building was in danger of collapse due to the failure of several of the respondents' windows, the respondent admitted that he had inspected some of the defendants' joists and found them to have cracked, broken or missing welds. For the plaintiff, that his first visit to the mall was in 1979 and he observed that many of the welds and joists had been covered with slag, which made it impossible to inspect for weld length and freedom from defects. When he visited the respondent again in May, he was unable to say how many times he conducted such an inspection. HELD: The respondent was correctly told that the slag deposits in the joints were the cause of the problems in the mall, and therefore there could be a real and substantial danger to the occupants of the building. Further, there was no evidence that additional remediation was required.  1) In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty or more years and had a failure rate of 1% or less, only failed welds or members would be repaired. 2) The respondent's failure rate was 8.3%. 3) The failure rate for all respondents was 7.5%. 4) There were a couple of incidents that were beyond the scope of this report, but overall the respondent did not conduct any type of inspection. The respondents were all concerned about safety concerns arising from the mall's collapse and did not inform their supervisors of this concern. The issue was whether there were any real or substantial problems that were caused by the defendant's negligence and whether repairs were being undertaken in the manner they were intended to alleviate this danger.  5) A number of subcontractors were hired to inspect the premises. Some of the subcontractors left over from the previous inspection did not perform their due diligence due to"

The fiat was granted beyond the time limit forty seven days later. The applicant argued the time limit did not commence until after the completion of the judicial recount provided by s126-128 of the Local Government Election Act.

b_2011nsca34.txt,". This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","Rule 4.07(3) assumes that a motion to dismiss must occur before the filing of a defence because it directs the judge to set a time for filing the defence. More than two years after the suit started, appellant applied for stay. The Chambers judge did not explicitly determine whether the applicant had attorned to the jurisdiction of the court or if a failure to intervene would give rise to a patent injustice. The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. Rule 8.02 for abuse of process is only available if the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a failure not to intervene. Rule 4.06(3)(d) assumes the applicant has not yet advanced the litigation process by agreeing to, attending discoveries and providing documents; Section of the Nova Scotia Arbitration Act is more specific than the Canadian Commercial Arbitration act; and, unlike the appellant, the respondent had taken fresh steps to advance the proceeding by producing a list of documents and providing additional documents and agreeing to discovery dates."

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: In early 2008, a major Saskatchewan hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. There may have been other sources of acquisition funding, such as National Bank of Canada. National Bank only been added as a party defendant to the foreclosure actions required by Rule 436(2A) because of National's interest in the equity of redemption (subject to the rights of National). National arranged for the appointment of a receiver. HELD: Both applications are dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 1) The present FCC claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective 3-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel.  2) National Bank's defences are so closely connected with National's that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National's defences into consideration. 3) There is no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the mortgagee's statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions without having to meet the more stringent requirements for injunctive relief. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases."

In this appeal the appellant argues that the trial judges failed to take into account the fact that the appellant was swaying on his feet, that his eyes were bloodshot and his pupils were dilated and he thought this other car pulled out in front of him when in fact she was slowing for turn. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. She did not err. 2)The words 'impaired by alcohol' in the Criminal Code raises an issue for the trier of fact in each case.

The executor had no clear understanding of the proceeding or his position as executor and appeared to have a weak grasp of how they were dealt with.

HELD: The Court's application was dismissed when heard. 1) There is no need to draw distinction between professional and alternative statutes. If this Court were to draw a distinction when the legislature has not, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s8(2). 2) With regard for the nature of general appellate legislation, it is necessary to consider the role of the legislature in The Registered Nurses Act in The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, 1978. 3) The legislature amended The Registered Nursing Act, 1993, by granting specific right to the discipline body and to the nurses to appeal from Queen’s Bench unless an enactment “confers only a limited right of appeal” (SS 1959, 12). 4) The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out, but that enactment must provide a 'providing' for that purpose, and that a further enactment confers a “confer only limited right’ to appeal. That is the general rule.”  5) It is an error to construe s7 by asking whether the legislature intended to give rise to a new era of clarity with respect to the jurisdiction that an appeal lies to the court of appeal in this Court from hereon.  6) There are no special circumstances in which the Court may rely upon the ability of an officer of the Saskatchewan College of Psychologists to exercise his or her discretion to refer an appeal to the Court as a matter of fact rather than an exercise of legislative will to contrary in any other enactment."

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: 1) The plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants. There were numerous breaches, both explicit and implicit, of the plaintiff's contractual right to bid on his behalf and for its own benefit. 2) There were a number of alleged breaches which raised the concern of breach of contract, but none central to the final analysis. 3) There are indications that the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserve auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid or for its benefit. There was nothing in the original contract between the parties that could have constituted binding contract. 4) In the interim, the plaintiff was approached by the defendants, who were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market already dominated by commodity-price competition. The defendants were determined to be the primary purchasers of the goods at the auction. They were also determined to have been the primary dealers of the equipment. 5) The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of plaintiff, purchased the equipment from the defendant in 2003 and intended to sell it to the highest bona fide bidder. He was concerned that if the plaintiff bid indirectly on an owner's behalf, or for his benefit, the defendant would void the contract. He sought to establish himself as the primary dealer. He refused to supply equipment to the plaintiff but offered to refurbish and sell equipment for resale. He also refused to accept a commission for"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, accountant and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were corporations in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors. The documents at issue were originally in the possession of the Melfort office of the accounting firm which acted as an office for all of the applicants. HELD: 1) The accountant was clearly acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking, receiving, or implementing legal advice from the applicant. 2) The letter and copy of the same letter were to be sent to the applicant's solicitor, who then forwarded those documents to the applicants' solicitor for production to Revenue Canada. 3) There was no privilege in the communications between the accountant and the applicants for the purposes of obtaining legal advice.  4) The description of the accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the applicants was clearly one of that of a representative for the client and not of a solicitor. 5) The parties' communications were privileged and the privilege extended to include remarks made by the applicants to the solicitor and to notes and memoranda of the accountants. 6) Correspondence and cooperation between the applicants and their accountants was strictly prohibited. 7) In this case, the accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant for obtaining legal advise. 8) The Act does not extend to communications between an accountant and a solicitor unless the communications are intended to perfect the legal advice given by the appellant. 9) There is a common law test for privilege which deals with the extent to which a solicitor's privilege can be asserted in communications between a client and its accountant. In this sense, this concept is explained in Susan Hosiery. The distinction between the 'litigation' or 'lawyer's brief' privilege and the 'Solicitor client privilege' was established in the cases of Wolch's Guaranteed Foods Ltd. v. Melfort, 1994 CanLII 8935 (AB QB), 84 SaskR 117 (Q.B.). In Bankruptcy it was held that the auditor was acting as representative or agent for the appellant claiming privilege in that it communicated with the appellant in the context of litigation.  8) It is common ground that no litigation was contemplated in this case."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was confronted by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation escalated to the point where the accused threw the knife at the complainant, who ran towards the vehicle, chased after him, and slashed the complainant's tire, and then ran into the back alley. The complainant confronted the accused in his dufflebag, grabbed a knife, and, in very close quarters, the accused and the complainant threw a number of bottles at the officer, who, in turn, saw the accused running towards him and, while he did not see the knife, heard the complainant shout something and the accused grabbed a large butcher knife, which he held in his hand and, as the complainant testified, the knife was still in the defendant's hand. At trial, the defence argued that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the two men and the words used by the defendant spoken to the complainant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. The Crown also raised the issue of self-defence in the context of several other cases. HELD: The accused is guilty of assault. The evidence established that the accused initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the complainant. The fact that the complainant did not further assail the complainant or touch him could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s.267(a). The Crown has established that by these actions the accused threatened to apply force to the defendant and that the knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code."

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. 2) It was reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the involvement of the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted by the Committee. The Committee made errors of law by improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist and by failing to take into account all relevant factors (i.e. its statistical analysis was more reliable than thestatistical analysis presented by MCIB); the Committee used and relied on the opinion of the director of professional review in preference to the Committee's and uncontroverted expert evidence. 3) There was an unreasonable apprehension of institutional bias which raised the issue of legitimacy.  4) It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose their fair share of costs on the public purse. It is impossible, if not impossible, for a cardiologist to perform as effectively as he did in his clinic without significant hospitalization costs or involvement with the medical community. It would be unfair and inexcusable for the Committee to abuse its discretion in refusing to advise the appellant of such things as to appropriate treatment for his patients."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent company, which contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, Jollymore contracted for the material as well as the services of subcontractors. There was no direct contact between the Appellant and the wife, and the purchasing of all the material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with the flooring manager. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. During the construction process, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by Jollymore or Maritime and the plaintiff did not receive satisfactory explanation from Jollymore as to where the money went. The flooring remained in the applicant's home, but the application for compensation was dismissed. The presence of a special relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim. After examining the evidence, it was concluded that there was a 'casual arrangement' between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it formally or clandestinely. This relationship in turn is usually, but not always, marked by two characteristics, firstly knowledge of the benefit on the part of the defendant, and secondly, either an express or implied request by the defendant for the benefit, or acquiescence in its performance. The same is not true in almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded. It is the essential nexus between the defendants' words and conduct and the plaintiffs conferring of the benefits. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The adjudicator did find that the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The adoption of such a view would mark a significant retreat from established principles of restitutionary liability. On balance the presence of such relationship will be persuasive but not necessarily conclusive in the fact-finder's analysis. The absence of a particular relationship willNot necessarily defeat the claim."

In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","Respondents: When the respondent mother died in 1999, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The appellant paid about $45,000 to his sisters as well as obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against the appellant for the amounts they, as the residuary beneficiaries, should have received. This appeal was against that judgment. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error and the judge made no such error. There is nothing more than the lack of consideration and the fact that the appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him.

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment, which provided that the husband would pay child support of $3,350 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, which was established when each of the children were born. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the spousal support order ended) and having him available for employment within months of that order. The husband asserted that he had no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would result in a different order of support. In addition, he paid the full table amount of child support payable by the parties in the amount of $5,000. The wife's application to vary support was dismissed. The parties made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The oldest child, who was 23 at the time of the order, had not graduated until October 2006.

8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana was not necessary or required in all cases. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra-vires. 1) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Court was of the view that the board's Interpretation that the Review of the Board's Decision to Denay reimbursement of Medical Marihuana was reasonable. 2) The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. It does not appear to be the case here that Board's reasoning that it cannot rely on blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of a particular drug is unreasonable. There is no evidence before the Board that it was required to determine whether or not to reimburse the costs of obtaining, growing, or using medical marijuana (i.e., the smoked form). The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of that Act. The respondent was awarded the application for judicial review. The Court held that the conclusion the Board had had exclusive jurisdiction to refuse reimbursement falls within the ranges of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. 3) There was nothing in the language of the statement that could be said to suggest that a determination that the medical aid is not 'necessary or necessary' or'required' is unreasonable but this is not the case Here. The decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is not proven and therefore not necessary (sic) and that it is not required or required to be reimbursed within the scope of the Health and Safety Board's discretion to determine all matters in questions arising under the Act."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant questions the term of the rental contract which stated that the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof and the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment was water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimer. 2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The defendant was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions in all the circumstances. In all, the defendant was only 20 percent responsible for $250,000 in damages. 3) The Court assessed the quantum of damages against the defendant and found mitigation of damages to be at issue. 4) The court found that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional 2 days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading."

Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff, Phoenix, applied for the dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, a vessel that would have made a significant contribution to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. Phoenix had been detailed to calculate the business loss resulting from the loss of the Sealife III. Phoenix called various witnesses on the basis of the application that the plaintiff had failed to make reasonable effort to produce the documents and to give full discovery to the defendant. Phoenix's evidence was unsatisfactory. It was difficult to understand why estimates of weight would be used when the fish is being weighed on arrival at the plant, unless, of course, the estimates were understated. There was also evidence concerning the use of truck scales, which were kept at the defendants' plant. HELD: 1)The plaintiff had not been properly informed of the use and validity of the scales upon which the calculations were to be made. 2)The defendant was not under any obligation to provide the plaintiff with the information requested. Rather, it was placed on the shoulders of its employees to filter the information supplied. The conflicting evidence and positions of the parties presented at this application make it necessary to make certain findings of fact and credibility. If find the defendant's evidence credible and acceptable, the matters may conclude that it had produced the information reasonably required of it and such other information was not relevant.  3)The court was unable to address the evidence presented by the employees of the defendant as to the methods to be used in calculating the value of the sealife III landings, or to conclude that the weight of the fish actually received was in relation to the amount owed to the fishermen."

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The Court sentenced the two offenders to 40 months concurrent for the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The Court was bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict. The sentencing judge must not accept as fact any evidence inconsistent with the verdict rejected by the jury, especially when the evidence is of a person who aided in the commission of the offence. It is with these principles that the sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence."

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded 80 milligrams. The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused, the police officer made the demand and she provided a suitable sample. This delay was not satisfactory to the accused and prejudiced her. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit. There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time from arrival at the scene to the time the tests were taken. The Crown did not mention the s. 8 violation in its notice and defence was not allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial."

Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001.

The wife alleged that the husband had failed to provide her with an automobile, and that under the terms of the separation agreement, she was to continue to receive spousal support for an indefinite period. She also alleged that he had advanced money to her during the course of the marriage. HELD: 1)The evidence supports a conclusion that the agreement was made only for 1 year. The Court found that the wife was entitled to spOUSAL support retroactive to the date the husband ceased paying it (April 2004). 2)The Court concluded that the entitlement to spousals at separation was continued and that her financial needs and needs require such support. It did not find that the evidence supported a conclusion it was agreed to be only for one year. There were disadvantages related to the husband's personal circumstances which must be addressed. The obligation to provide support was set forth in s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 3)The husband was to pay $1,000 per month until December 31, 2001.

Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The plaintiff was found not liable. The court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in a series of articles published on newspapers and websites. The plaintiff did not file any complaints with the hospital or any of the defendants until the very last day of her trial, which was at which point she went into cardiac arrest and had to be amputated. The articles caused irreparable damage to the plaintiff’s reputation and it was hoped that they would eventually be added as a defendant. The defendants opposed this application on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which could conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as result of the requested amendment."

Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.

The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application to confirm the sale must be brought by notice of application.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting portions of the University of Saskatchewan Act and the Act, particularly Section 51. 2. The Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation, including the context and purpose of the legislation, the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature, the contextual approach and the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result. Both parties relied on dicta from Dunsmuir in support of their submissions. HELD: 1)An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor the collective agreement. The right to grieve a decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board reversed a decision of one of the committees. The review decision left open whether the Board was bound by the president's recommendation or by the Agreement. 2)The Arbitrator found after reviewing the Saskatchewan Act, its provisions, and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the President in accordance with the terms of the agreement. He found that the Board may never grant person tenure unless and until they are 'nominated for the appointment' or'recommended for the promotion'. 3)The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  4)The dispute arose as a result of a dispute between the parties concerning the awarding of tenure and whether the president had the authority to appoint or promote a faculty member pursuant to the Agreement or, alternatively, whether it was an appointment or promotion within the meaning of that Act.  5)It was agreed that the parties would have to deliberate on whether the Act requires the president to appoint someone to a permanent position on the academic staff of the university or whether it is a power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. The arbitration decision dealt with whether a person can be appointed as a probationary assistant professor if that person has been nominated for the position by a president; if not that their employment expires at the end of a fixed term. 6)The arbitration decision was appealed. The parties agreed that a review of the decision would be necessary to determine whether a tenure award or promotion was appropriate under the circumstances of the time and place they were appointed."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then went to hold that the appellant was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. Appeal Allowed. From the outset, the trial judge distributed the value of the family property on the premise its distribution was governed by s. 21 and 23 of the Acts. The respondent, faced on appeal with the possibility the judge may have misapplied these sections, contended the matter was governed not by s21 and 23 but by s22. HELD: The appeal was allowed.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of s. 23(1)(a) and (c), which exempts property acquired prior to the commencement of spousal relationship from distribution. The definition extends to persons who have cohabited with one another as spouses for a period of 2 years. 2) There was a finding of fact, but it was not sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) There are number of facts that merit an exemption, even if it is unfair or inequitable to require a confirmation of confirmation of the debt or obligation to repay on numerous occasions. There are a number of exemptions which must be considered in order to give equal consideration to the loans. 4) The respondent's position regarding the loans and the mortgages in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions."
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, T.J.E.S., born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection and the Ministry has no legal authority to force a parent to do anything if there is no basis for apprehension. The Court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent that has occurred or is proposed, any plan of corrective action that is being advanced, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved. 2) There must be a reasonable prospect of change, within a reasonable length of time and reasonable use of resources if needed. Where, as here, children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. This analysis is supported by the Saskatoon Court of Appeal in S.F. (Re), 2009 SKCA 121 (CanLII). 3) In making an order under s. 11 of the Act, the court must do so on the basis of the evidence before it. The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant recognized her obligation to contribute to her own support and continued her efforts to find employment. 2)Plelech does not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. It is expressly agreed by the parties that this settlement constitutes a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. 3)The principles of Pelech should not be used to restrict the application and purposes of s.17 of the Divorce Act. Where a person has negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled, the Court may exercise its relieving power. 4)The appellant had established that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur. Such changes in this context could not be considered radical unless they were permanent or substantially long-standing."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","The medical doctor appeals from decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal). The original suspension was done wrongfully and precipitously, and ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to statutory appeal. The appellant's evidence is that all options were reviewed with CC, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. This was done appropriately, as during the treatment of the uterine rupture, requiring remedial steps to safeguard the mother's welfare. The respondent operates health care facilities including hospitals including the appellant's. To do so, those doctors must first obtain privileges under the respondent's Bylaws, which require every health authority to make a bylaw governing the practitioner staff covering, inter alia, privileges and the matters in issue in the within appeals. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo appeal hearing. It is not an appeal on the record. Curial deference is not owed and the tribunal may (indeed, must) take its own view of the evidence put before it and is not bound by the views of the Board. HELD: The Court finds that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant met the standard of care and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges.  1) This case cannot be taken to be supportive of the suspension of the SMO. 2) There is no real nexus between this rare condition and other situations Dr. Abouhamra was called upon to manage in the course of his ob/gyn practice. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal is that the responses were accepted by the Tribunal and satisfied any concerns he might have had. Accordingly, the Tribunal suspended the appellant on an interim basis.  3) The Court concludes that the holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, or how things could be improved. The hearing should proceed in the same fashion as it proceeded before the Tribunal."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the two children moved again to the respondent's residence. This arrangement continued to the present. In 2006, the respondent paid $300 per month as child support but made no payment for the month of June. The petitioner now wants to be compensated for lost wages and the cost of fuel. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is an ordinary, and not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. 2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. This is one further collateral matter. The respondent acknowledges that he has, from time to time, borrowed money from the bank accounts of the children. He was able to do this because he had signed authority. It may be that he had the consent of each child, but the fact remains that such conduct is wrong and should not be repeated. 3) The respondent was awarded one-half of the $4,237.16 payable for child support for 2005 and 2006 based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) There was no retroactive variation of the order dated June 29, 2004 which stipulated that the respondent pay monthly child support of $500 for three children commencing July 1, 2004. On five occasions the petitioner failed to attend as directed with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip. This amounted to material change and should be retroactive to that date."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his behalf in the event the prosecution insisted on proceeding with a trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to a fair trial. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged of possession for the purpose of trafficking and he has failed to meet the second criterion of being indigent. He has made no effort to obtain financing or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel. The Court found that the accused is unlikely to conduct his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. He comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel and, therefore, it is important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements.  1) The Court was satisfied from the information and material placed before the accused that he probably does not have the ability to conduct himself own defence given the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge or charges against the accused and the fact that he may not be able to pay his legal fees in the amount of $2,500 per month. There is a cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to the potential trial that will enable the accused, if he so chooses, to attempt to make arrangements for counsel making periodic payments over the ensuing months to defend himself. 2) There are two germane criteria an accused must demonstrate in order to qualify for a court appointed lawyer: that he is unable to afford counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer; and that representation is essential to fair trial performance. The essence of the application is that he wishes to have lawyer appointed by the court to represent him at his trial. It is my understanding that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1)of the Charter, in which the prosecution insists on proceeding in breach thereof. The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority"
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants sought a judgment in respect to a peer review of three individuals who had committed suicide at the hands of their own hand. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that they would be receiving an external review. The authors, being physicians with privileges at the Regional Hospital, were approached by the appellants to participate in the peer review. They were assured confidentiality would be honoured. They proceeded to publish the report, which was not to be released to the public. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that peer review is an educational tool and confidentiality should not be grounds for suspicion by family members or members of the general public. Here, physicians were to be the authors of a report intended to provide answers to questions posed by the families as well as to ensure the confidentiality of their participation in the process."

HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. The deceased had a small stroke which affected his speech temporarily few days before the will was signed. The doctor testified that in his opinion the doctor could instruct and complete last will and testament at that time. Evidence now before the Court by one of the witnesses to the will is that two and one-half years before he signed the will, he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will, which was never signed because of family pressure. The evidence is that the lawyer had instructed the applicant to draw the different will in order to better serve his family over charity. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. 1)There is a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors have provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the applicant. 2)There was nothing out of the ordinary about the circumstances surrounding the will. The applicant had given instructions for 1998 and then changed his mind. 3)Two and a half years prior to the signing of the last will, the applicant had instructed a different lawyer, who had received instructions for never-completed will in 1998. The propriety of such disclosure by the lawyer is a matter for another day, its relevance is far from clear. Two and one half years ago the applicant instructed the lawyer to make a very different will. This was a very important document which was kept secret from the Court for many months thereafter."

The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.

The respondent issued a formal judgment in July 2006 and the eight page judgment sets forth in detail the background to the disputed issue, canvasses the submissions of the applicant and the Trustee, and then provides an analysis leading to the registrar's conclusion. The registrar defines the issue in the following terms: 'Should the applicant be permitted to make a claim as secured creditor under the debtor's proposal?' Under the background assessment, the trustee's analysis that permits court to get to the PPSA is correct but the submission that section 20(2)(a) is applicable is not supported by the legislation.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain a Warrant to Search [ITO]. The accused disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, questioned the validity of it, and claimed his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Crown could adduce evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the warrant, and to countenance subsequent validation. There was no evidence before the court as to the extent that the ITO could be used to approximate or amplify the evidence seized by the search.  1) The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor or technical errors made by the investigators, but which were done in good faith and not with an intent to deceive or mislead. This practice has since changed. 2) None of the accused's testimony in the original ITO was admissible in respect of whether his Charter rights were violated. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be a countenance further validation.  3) The ITO is a separate proceeding from the trial proper and the evidence taken on voir net forms no part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. 4) In reviewing the sufficiency of a warrant application, the court must recognize (along with investigative necessity) the two principles of prior authorization and probable grounds, the verification of which may require a close examination of the information available to the police at the time of the application for wiretap, in considering the jurisprudence on which it was presented to the justice of the peace. The approach set out to erroneous information in an affidavit on a wiretap application attempts to reconcile these principles."

The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.

The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time.

Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend the children. The accused was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with the complainant. The defence argued that the accused was not in hot pursuit of an individual and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with Ms. Bigsky. HELD: 1) It was open to the Crown and the Ministry to establish that any contact of the children with Justin Lerat was harmful to the children and to infringe on their right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. The fact that the worker had directed the accused not to have any contact with her does not alter that situation. It is indicative that the officer did not believe he had authority under the criminal code to act, and that he wasn't attempting to act under the Charter.  2) The totality of the evidence was to the effect that the defence officer, who was appointed by the Minister under s. 57(b) of the Child and Family Services Act, was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the complainant's suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had cut down some trees on his property, by mistake. The defendant had been friends with the plaintiff for years and had offered to remove the trees when the weather improved. The plaintiff had not seen the defendant cutting down the trees, but had heard from neighbours who noted that the trees had been removed by the defendant. Defendant granted the plaintiff's costs in the amount of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $5,750. The claim against the defendant was dismissed. The court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach (it could be because the enterprise was itself unlawful, or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm). The plaintiff was awarded costs of $174.13 for the issuance of the claim, plus $100.00 for service on the claim on the two defendants. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant was clearly part of a joint enterprise to remove few damaged trees from his own property, which was a fully lawful enterprise. There was no reasonable foreseeability he would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. If there was liability on either or both of the defendants, what were the damages? 2)The plaintiff was entitled to costs of the action against the first defendant, given the uncertainty about the boundary, it would not matter whether he supplied the chainsaw or the gas. He could not have foreseen the defendant would be expanding his cutting to an area anywhere near the neighbours."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure, which would indicate that there had been an attack on the complainant. The Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the dog had been attacked by the complainant, and it was open to the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he took reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. HELD: The accused was fined $200. On the definition of attack, as understand it, the offence is an unrequested confrontation of human by dog made in circumstances where the dog exhibits loud and angry-sounding barks, snarls, growls and makes within close range of the human. The dog's actions might have justified a hearing under the other section of The Animal Disease and Protection Act with respect to detection and control of rabies, but in this case the accused did not take reasonable steps. There are seven specific pieces of evidence that back up the conclusion the accused failed to act reasonably on these four occasions. 1) the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady that was attending a garage sale. 2) the owner of the residence had either gotten the dog off its logging chain leash or had his daughter get into her vehicle and drove away before the dog got any closer. There was clear evidence that on the occasion when the complainant's daughter was in her back alley the dog escaped from her house and then ran through the garbage cans enclosure. The Court was of the view, in light of what the Crown had proved, that there were no reasonable steps taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) filed with the Court on the same date and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator issued an order for Substituted Service by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the defendant the new hearing date. This matter was to return to court on May 18, 2010. The applicant states that he was not in contact with his mother for an extended period months. He therefore claimed he did not receive notice of the hearing date and that he chose to ignore it. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of $139.35 to the appellant. 1)It is a breach of the requirements for natural justice not to have a mechanism in Small Claims court whereby, if defendant does not file a defence or appear at a hearing by mistake, but can show that he or she has an arguable defence that should be heard on its merits and he has a reasonable excuse for defaulting and is not just stalling, (emphasis added) and there is no prejudice to the claimant's ability to prove its case, the judgment cannot be set aside. In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse.  2)It does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he didn't attend the hearing. Natural justice demands that he be heard."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault, including touching a person under the age of 14 years with a part of his body contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and two counts of touching directly or with an object contrary to the same s. 151 of the Code. The accused and his family lived in the same neighbourhood as the complainant, which is not far from Dartmouth. The Crown argued that the four counts related to the complainant's reliability, reliability, impartiality or honesty. HELD: The accused was found guilty of all four counts. 1) The accused had been in common-law relationship with the complainant. He had been living with her. They would have been between 10 to 15 and 11 to 16 years old respectively during the most relevant time periods herein. 2) There was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where each household lived for what period of time, which has implications for where and when the alleged incidents are to have taken place. 3) There were a number of incidents that reflected the accused's 'ongoing sexual interest' in the girl. The essential elements of Sexual assault were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. In this case, the Crown sought to establish that the accused, who had been charged with the same counts, had intentionally touched the complainant and her sister, who considered him an uncle, by way of an invitation, incitement or counseling to do physical or sexual harm to her. The complainant had been 12 at the time of the alleged offences. 4) The Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any of the offences. The Court was unable to determine whether the accused intended the victim to receive a sexual communication as an invite, induce, induce or sexual gesture from him or her, or if he intended her to believe that he had a sexual relationship with her and, in some cases, to allow her to experience the sensation of being touched directly or indirectly by him."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. A temporary guardianship order issued in Alberta was revoked in 2005. The child was returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities. The parties then put themselves forward as potential adoptive parents. They temporarily re-located to Nova Scotia, where the order was terminated in 2005 and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order under which the respondents became the guardians of the child not in the permanent care of an agency (subject to limited exceptions). The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; certain portions of the appellant's affidavit and affidavit were admitted. Although the appellant intended to be at the adoption hearing and made reasonable efforts for legal representation, she was not present or represented at the hearing. She made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to represent her at the access hearing. The court would be unable to decide whether the reference to access in the private guardianhip order is an 'access order' or 'access provision' within the meaning of s.78(6) of the Act; the parties were unaware that the appellant wished to be heard. The due diligence requirement was not applicable in this case."
6_2007skqb111.txt,"FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure. The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles, it would not be appropriate to retroactively reinstate the caveat. The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Township Two (2), in Range Four (4), in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, were entitled to costs of defending the application.

d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned some $69,000 to the defendant, who she then husband Ken, into the auto brokering business known as Auto Brokers 1999 (E M). The claim went on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendant denied the loan was a loan and asserted that the plaintiff had not made a loan to either of them. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The evidence of the cross-examination by the defendant showed that she did not make a loan on the basis that there was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant's company and/or numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)There was no evidence of a loan by either party on the balance of the payments made. 3)The defendant had not filed any affidavit with the plaintiff on a monthly basis. On the basis of what she had stated in the affidavit and the discussion with her husband about the possible repayment of the loan, the plaintiff was not making a loan. However, she did make a monthly statement to the plaintiff stating that she had made a decision on her own regarding the amount to be paid per month. She stated that she was not carrying any material with which to make a written decision. On her written statement of decision to pay monthly monies, she stated that the agreement was not a loan as it was not supported by the documents filed with the court."
9_2003skqb481.txt,The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for the Attorney General to discharge under s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act. HELD: The motion on behalf of the accused was granted and the hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004.  1)The accused was entitled to disclosure of all the evidence in his custody or control except only the diplomatic note from the USA to Canada which initiated the process. There had been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The application for detailed disclosure prior to an extradition hearing was dismissed. The accused's motion was without merit and it was not expedient at this stage. 3)The issues with disclosure were as follows: 1)It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for a extradition hearing. The Minister has a role at the beginning and end of the extradition process. The judge discharges his or her function in the middle. Each operates independently of the other except to the extent that the Minister's final involvement is contingent on a judicial order for committal. Neither engages in the other's area of responsibility. Neither reviews the other’s determination or decision.  4)The Act is a modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extrad hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case. The extradition procedure is based upon a treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has a fair and just criminal system. Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the performance of our obligations under extradition treaties, is vested in the executive. The role of the hearing judge is modest one, confined to what is specified in the enabling statute. That role has not been advanced, nor is it expedient. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed in this Court."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 that alleged the application of a 'Torch on' air vapour barrier to the northeast corner of the Tower. The defendants had filed statement of defence against the City of Saskatoon, Fire Chief William Hewitt and numerous architects and engineers. In issue was whether certain documents (statements) referred to in the plaintiff's statement as to documents and for which the plaintiffs claimed privilege were obtained from the city. The plaintiff argued the question was too vague to answer. Objection No. 8-P. 317, Line 15 to P. 318 had no objection to the questions asked. The question related to the manner of the plaintiffs' investigation and was not proper. Both the plaintiff and defendant were entitled to know what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its occupants, the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working, etc. HELD: The questions can be asked of any third party. There is no obligation on the plaintiffs to seek information from third parties when the defendants are as capable of obtaining that information as the plaintiffs. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to question of this nature when reference is made to document. The Court failed to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. HELD: 1)The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger.  2)There is no doubt that the offender fits the criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time. The only real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than a more serious dangerous offender designation.  3)There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault against his estranged wife and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed. If he refuses to do so, his risk for future violence will be high. He appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and does not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life and in his potential for violent crimes in the future."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules were applied. The applicant had failed to meet the requirements set out in the Farm Land Security Act (SFSA). The land had been purchased by a developer for development and its focus and direction had been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. The proposed use of the land was described as 'farming' with livestock raising, poultry raising, dairying, tillage of the soil, bee-keeping, fur farming or any other activity undertaken to produce primary agricultural produce were not permitted. The redemption period was 90 days from the date of this decision. 1)No foundation had been laid to cause the applicant to deviate from the SFSA. The mortgage by s. 7(c) prohibited the mortgager leasing without the mortgagee's consent, however the effect of this provision on the so-called March 19, 2010 renewal of 'lease' was not argued or tested. 2)The fact that the applicant was owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale did not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties or at least give a preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure. The bidding process is more than a simple accounting device and consequently the fact that a particular bidder will be receiving funds from the property should not enter into the judicial sale process. This application by the applicant is dismissed."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. In all cases to which the Court was drawn by counsel, the children have been ordered returned. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the respondent and Joshua's prolonged absence in the former jurisdiction. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, the Court determined that the child must have been habitually resident in the Contracting State immediately prior to being wrongfully removed or retained. The Court concluded that the relief under Article 12 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 is not in conflict with the case law developed under the convention. 3) The petitioner obtained an interim order in February 2004 which, inter alia, ordered the respondent to return Joshua to the United States and granted him sole custody. It is an open question whether the return should be conditional upon the respondent having varying the order he obtained in relation to the child. In any event, reconciliation was attempted and the child was returned to the petitioner."

This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The plaintiff officers were reduced in rank to the rank of Sergeant. The issue was whether the two-tier system for a sergeant violated s. 35(1) of the Regulations made under the Police Act. HELD: The statement of claim was struck out. The court held that it had jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter. It held that, in determining whether the dispute arises from the collective agreement, a dispute arises out of it. The essential character of the dispute is not one of convenience or exclusivity. The issues are matters that fall within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the TUA. The Court of Appeal reviewed recent cases in Nova Scotia and held that the same decision was made in the District of Columbia, both of which dealt with the same set of issues. The Supreme Court of Canada adopted and held scrupulously to an exclusive jurisdiction model in respect to the interpretation and application of collective agreements and trade union legislation. The decision was based on the principles set out in the relevant decision."

The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was an appeal of a decision which overturned the respondent's decision to appoint an arbitrator to hear the applicant's grievance. Dismissing the appeal, that the Minister of Labour and Manpower had misinterpreted a point of law by stating that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition. There was sufficient ground to grant an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the Minister to exercise his discretion pursuant to s. 107(4) of the Trade Union Act as confirmed by the parties."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. The petitioner argued that his mother no longer available to provide child care during his access weekends. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)Once a material change has occurred in the circumstances of the children, pursuant to s. 14(a) of the Act, the issue of child support ought to be revisited. The evidence suggested that there had been some change in the respondent's circumstances. It did not satisfy the Court that there was any material change in his circumstances. 2)The respondent provided no evidence as to the amount, the method or when his father provided him with 'gifts' as he describes them. His father passed away prior to the pre-trial conference. The allegation is that he has received no gifts since then and his mother is not able to afford to help him. Without evidence of the earlier gifts, there was no means of comparing the present circumstance to the past. 3)The parties agreed upon the imputation of income (the respondent's income in 1998 was $43,209.40 and his income in 2000 was $44,386). 4)They agreed upon a specified access amount based upon his income. The parties each provided their own tax returns showing their taxable income at the time of the agreement. The material does not change the fact that there has been no change in their circumstances. The matter has been posed in a material manner in the manner requested. Once again, the Court cannot rely upon either party's ability to provide cogent and where possible, independent or objective verification of the change of circumstances."
e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst in the basement of her home. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. 1)The court could not find on the evidence that clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the likelihood of the plaintiff suffering damage to the proximate price point.  2)There was a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. The evidence demonstrated that she did not sign any authorization to disconnect. She did not request the water be disconnected and accordingly no signature was required or obtained on the back of the form. Neither did Ms. Isaac advise the power was being shut off."

The court found that a fine plus a court order with strict conditions could accomplish the principles of sentencing as described in R. v. Gardiner (1982), 68 C.C.

The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: On September 19, 2007, the respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agree that given the age of the children, and their change in the amount of support payable by the respondent, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for the two children directly to the respondent so that the children no longer qualify as a child of that marriage within that meaning. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the Age of majority. It can now be stated that the following three steps need to be addressed: firstly towards the ongoing child support for the children; secondly towards the arrears; and finally towards the total arrear.  4) In this case, the parties agree the respondent is not providing support to the children in an appropriate fashion.

9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The issue of whether the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with holiday pay was severed from the jury and left in reserve until the Court of Appeal renders its decision. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. Even if the plaintiff was entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct in this regard. 2)There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with. The first issue was whether the plaintiff could rely on the presumption arising out of the LSA, which is that holiday pay should not be based on his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. As such, it would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse his actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage, his salary and the truck allowance at the time of his dismissal. 3)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday compensation for the 10 years. It would be substantially prejudiced if the defendant was now allowed to assert that right. 4)HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $19,000 for bad conduct for the period April 1988 to October 1997. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination (which would have arisen within the statutory period of 6 years), the plaintiff also received $1,000 in holiday pay as a share of his salary."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, and s. 11(c) and (d) of the Charter. HELD: 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel and one count of publishing without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed toinsult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2)There was a rational connection between the objectives of protecting the privacy and reputations of persons in s.300 of the Code and the limitation on freedom of expression as guaranteed under s.2(b). The threshold test for the application of s. has been met.  3)S.300 is of sufficient importance to justify an infringement of s2(2). It is not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. 4)The impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern. There is proportionality to the legislation in that the measures must be fair and not arbitrary and carefully designed to achieve the objective and rationally connected to the objective. 5)Individuals are not faced with reverse onus if a matter published is of such trivial character as to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 6)Saskatchewan did not have a high threshold for application under s300. The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to free and democracy. The principles of fundamental fairness, decency and respect for the human dignity and worth of the person are at issue. The accused were accompanied by a number of other persons."
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","A tree fell on a half ton truck driven by the plaintiff, who was a paraplegic. For the defendant, that the tree had been in sufficient proximity to the plaintiff to come within the purview of his duty of care in regard to the removal of trees which were an immediate hazard to the public. The plaintiff sued the defendants, the owners of the property and the defendants' occupiers, for failing to provide proper maintenance of the trees. Dismissing the action with costs, that in order to establish whether a government policy to inspect exists, it must be open to the possibility of an expert being trained in tree pathology to detect the disease."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate a non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to me. Counsel for the appellant and SGI have agreed that the calculation is correct. 2) SGI has correctly calculated the respondent's net income when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. 3) The Act and Regulations contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. Because Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI."
4_2004nsfc6.txt,"The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The Agency applied for a finding that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child had stayed with the father when he was seventy-seven years old and had never been married or lived with a woman, just him and his dog. The daughter had sexual contact with him on occasion when she was eleven or twelve years old. These sexual encounters came to light when the daughter and her grandfather were watching a television program about sexual assault. The father was tried and acquitted of sexual assault in criminal court. The evidence of the complainant's alleged assault had more probability of truth than disbelief."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders since the separation, but all jurisdictional requirements had been met and a Divorce Judgment would be issued forthwith. The petitioner had received a substantial sum of money from his employer for medical and other benefits separate from the post tax deductions for long term disabilities, as well as some lump sum and periodic sums paid for directly by the respondent. The respondent paid an additional $1,000 in U.S. dollars for holidays with his sons. He received a bonus in the amount of $4,800. He was to apply for and receive a share of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. HELD: The court found that the respondent's income for the purposes of child support was fixed at $6,875 per month and he was to receive a bonus of $927. In addition to the monies paid for medical expenses, there were other outstanding debts which must be paid to the respondent in the event of a disruption in his income. It was an exceptional situation and the respondent must keep himself current with respect to child support. His use of credit card for access and other expenses is entirely his personal choice. It is very clear that these parties have never had an income stability sufficient to promote long term self sufficiency. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds. The corporate defendant solicitor had previously telephoned the plaintiff's solicitors to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. The plaintiff had previously been represented by his current solicitor. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The non-attendances did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence. 2)On the basis of their conduct throughout the whole of these proceedings, the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time they were permitted to file statements of defense. The defendants abused the discretion of the court that was exercised in their favour to set aside judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. It is inherent in Rule 231 that a person must be legally compellable to attend the time and place appointed for his examination before he can be found to be Refusing or neglected to attend. It cannot be used respecting the particular non attendances. 3)The defendants were awarded costs of the applications in any event of the cause."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period and is properly regulated through arbitration. The employer appealed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. At issue was whether the letter of July 22, 1994 was an ancillary document and whether it forms part of the collective agreement. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application; the appeal was directed to the arbitrator and directed that the action be stayed pending submission to arbitration as provided for by the in-laws. There were four considerations that supported the conclusion that, where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration."

He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1)There are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. These procedures were not followed. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts, he had evidence to prove his wife's perjury, it was not his intention to place that evidence before the court. He seemed to think all he had to do was raise the matter by way of argument, to warrant a fresh trial. 3)There were no precedents for this kind of conduct, on the facts as found by trial judge, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."
6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","One of the defendants in the main proceeding moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other threats and interfering with the workers conducting the harvest operation. The plaintiff argued the attachment order should be terminated because it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in Rule 49.01(1), and that the mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.  1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The witness did not say the contents were true. 2)The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. 3)The affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant on the issue of the alleged parcel changes and tax sale did not comply with the Rules 48.01 and 49.02. 4)There was no principled basis to justify the maintenance of a attachment order on the basis that the plaintiff had not established facts, not allegations or suspicions.  5)It was not necessary to establish either that there is an attempt to transfer property, and that there are other good reasons for termination (e.g. there were other reasons for the order), or that the defendant has dealt with its property with intent to frustrate justice."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at 2:40am. At 3:01 a.m. the accused provided a sample into an Alcotest 7410 GLC. The result was an 'F' indicating that the accused had blood alcohol levels of at least 100 milligram. The accused was transported back to the detachment where she was turned over to a qualified technician. The charge was dismissed. The court found that in order for a certificate of analysis to constitute evidence as set out in s. 254(1) of the Criminal Code, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. HELD: The accused's evidence as to the use of the model did not sufficiently advance the Crown's case and there was no evidence of blood alcohol content.  1)The accused's case was not properly characterized by the model, which would have been sufficient to identify the instrument by weight of the certificate, but rather by the fact that the technician described the model to the Crown in R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.). 2)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved instrument is a matter of law. If it were otherwise, no reference at all to the name of the instrument would be required, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose pursuant to s. 237(6) of Canada. 3)There was insufficient evidence to establish the accused’s level of impairment. There was no medical evidence that could be attributed to the model or to any other model. 4)Costs in the matter were directed to issues of evidence."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim custody with specified access. The petitioner requested that the child support be based on his 2005 income. Given the age and circumstances of the children and the fact that the petitioner had not seen the children for ten months, it was uncontroverted that the father had not been seen for the past ten months. 2) Retroactive child support was warranted. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties that the respondent would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. The parties based their verbal agreement on the petitioner's 2004 income. It is common for support provisions to be based upon the prior year's earnings. 3) The petitioner was awarded interim child support arrears of $8,107. 4) The court found nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. 5) The parties had discussed the adoption of a retroactive order pursuant to s. 18 of The Children's Law Act. The Court ordered that the retroactive orders be paid retroactively to January 2006. 6) The Court was not prepared to deduct the $9,600 from the respondent's 2006 income."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Allowing the appeal and declaring the tenancy had not been converted into a Month to Month, that the landlord had not withheld consent in a timely manner, for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant, and that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable."

At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002. He argued his income had decreased as a result of his being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing his lay-off was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage. She also opposed his application to increase his contribution for the child's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband was to pay child support of $534 per month for the two children and $60 per child support for hockey, golf and baseball expenses. 2) The wife's income had increased since the May 2002 order because he was laid off his employment. She had received employment insurance of $414 per week for the past 3 years. 3) The father's obligation to contribute to the children's riding lessons was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 4) The parties' current child had not taken any classes and the husband's contribution for them was not increased. The unreasonableness of the wife's position in determining child support based on her position in the marriage was grounds for a variation of the support order."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The issues relate to 15 properties. 15 properties were decided on one appeal and the issues were the same for each property. The test in such applications must be strictly applied when the applicant seeks to appeal an assessment. The door may still be opened but the key to opening it is a demonstrable case of concrete and material failure as it may relate to the general. The key certainly does not lie in speculative, abstract, or harmless failures of process related to the particular. The onus of establishing the ground is on the appellant.[4] Leave is granted to appeal on the basis of the sale and in argument the applicant said the impugned sale did not matter. Further on the record the Assessor was fully aware the sale was a portfolio sale, had contacted both the vendor and purchaser, and provided particulars of the sales verification form as part of the evidence to the Board. Leave is denied on the issue of standard of evidence and the issue has been decided by the Court. Leave to appealed is granted by reason of the two grounds listed above. 1) There is no evidence that the Committee made any error. The question of whether the Committee erred in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err. 2) The question must be one of law. It is the second prerequisite that causes the difficulty. The Committee made no error in failing to find that the application contravenes the Urban Municipality Act and the Manual by failing to consider the economic and political obsolescence for the purposes prescribed by the Manual. The method of analysis used in the assessment was not equivalent to the method used by the Committee in Shalk v. The City of Regina et al. (CanLII 4690). 3) Leave for appeal as to costs arising pursuant to the Court's decision to grant leave was denied."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender escaped custody following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. He was sentenced to a 5 month closed custody disposition concurrent to a 9 month open custody disposition previously imposed.

A police officer tried to stop the truck they were driving when they accelerated and hit the side of an attached garage. The Crown appealed the sentence.

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","Both litigants sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal. The wife took issue with the division of assets and alleged that the judge misapplied the value of the assets held by the parties in the sale of the Chicago property. The husband also brought an application to have the assets divided. Application dismissed; the evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant, or both; the judge found no palpable or overriding error in the manner in which he determined the amount owed. The evidence must generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. However, the Court would not permit any witness by simply repudiating or changing his trial evidence to reopen trials at will to the general detriment of the administration of justice; and it would not be proper for the Court to accept the wife's application to admit fresh evidence."
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","In dealing with the first application, the petitioner sought to vary the child support order granted by the court in 2005 by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wished to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 1990 CanLII 6863 (SK QB), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.)Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the court to the 'wishes of the children' issue is to take into account all the circumstances, including the child's wish to change from father to mother. 2)There was no evidence to suggest that this was no longer in the children's best interests. As no material change was demonstrated, the application must be dismissed."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed the Small Claims trial decision, which was found to be unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with one of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company. The essential facts are relatively straightforward. The contract was signed on May 29, 2014. The next evening, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff and asked if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to'seed along side us'. The trial judge refused to allow the plaintiff to refer to exhibit 5 and, as found by the appeal judge, asked if mitigation meant sitting by the phone and waiting for people to respond to his ads. 2)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep the plaintiff on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking Mr. Sheppard the same question multiple times. 3)The language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias."

The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike two affidavits it had prepared in response to a challenge to its authority to suspend and revoke the applicant's license. At issue was whether the affidavits were admissible on an application for certiorari and mandamus and whether the Court should restrict itself to considering the record as produced by the tribunal. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The affidavits filed by the applicant were not admissible. 2)There must be a real dispute. The Board's record shows an ongoing and clear dispute with respect to the authority of the Board to suspend, deal with and supervise the production and marketing of various natural products and certain regulatory bodies. 3) affidavits are admissable to complete the records. 4)If the court reviewed the present application as a jurisdictional dispute it would not find that affidavits, although always admissible, raised questions of jurisdiction or were merely an error in law. If it is to be denied on the basis of error of law on the face of the record, affidavit evidence is only admissible if the record does not provide enough information regarding the issues in dispute."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract. Roper appealed, arguing that the judge erred in finding that the defendant was in breach of the contract and in holding that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by not providing the approximate tonnages set out therein. The trial judge found that even if the defendant had performed the contract the plaintiff would have continued to operate at loss. As a result, the judge held that the plaintiff did not suffer any loss as a result of the termination of the contracts. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was awarded fair and reasonable compensation. 2)The defendant was awarded nothing but the sum of $10,000 awarded to the plaintiff for the costs incurred by the defendant in obtaining the substituted performance contract and the refund of overpayments made to Roper for the no work performed contract. 3)There was no loss of profits arising as a consequence of the defendant's termination."
c_2017skqb388.txt,HELD: The application was granted.

They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) The respondent is removed as an executor pursuant to the Grant of Probate ordered by Gabrielson J. in July 2016. This will give him an opportunity to bring his application back before the Court for determination. If he does not give notice by February 15, 2018, then, subject to a further order of this Court, this direction shall expire.  2) The Court has the jurisdiction to remove an executrator of an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. See Ocean Man Trust, 1993 CanLII 6781 (CA); Figley Figley, 2012 SKCA 36 (CanLII), 393 Sask 44; and Sinclair Sinclair, 2013 SKQB 123 (CanlII), 427 Sask 36. It is clear that this is a case in which the Court should exercise its jurisdiction. It ordered the removal of the respondent from the estate and ordered that the three executors be removed as executors. The direction for the Kent and Rodney Argue to take no steps to distribute assets in the estate until February 15 2018 is based upon the concept of 'other special circumstances'. It would seem obvious that the considerations respecting removal of an executorship under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court would be included in the concept 'other extraordinary circumstances'. 3) While there is dissension or disagreement within the executor community there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to do their duty. The Court reviewed the history of the executors and found that they all swore in good faith and acted in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. 4) There is no evidence that either of the deceased's sons or daughters acted in a fashion inconsistent with their obligations to administer the estate in accordance to the directions in the will.  5) There are no special circumstances within the meaning of s. 16 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, which directs that no person other than a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan holding a current practice certificate may enter or carry on or defend an estate.

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants.

Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property.

At the commencement of their trial in Supreme Court, after the jury selection, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police did not have reasonable grounds for their belief that the property searched contained narcotics, that the warrantless search was invalid, and that the respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their occupation and possession of the property. He held that the search was unreasonable and that there was no breach of their s. 8 Charter rights. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of that offence, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that it was too late to amend the Information. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered.  1) The Court found that the trial judge erred in law in that he did not adequately provide reasons for the decision of the Crown to grant the motion. 2) There was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. The date of the offences was not an essential element. 3) Section 601(4.1) of the Criminal Code lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on amendment applications, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice. If the reason for the denial of the motion was that the evidence presented at trial was not able to support the evidence at trial, that was also a reversible error."

Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to diligently proceed with its action. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its claim. 2) Mediation was concluded in February of 2000 and the defendant applied for an order pursuant to Rule 231 of the Queen's Bench Rules compelling the plaintiff to complete the undertakings given at the examination of Walter Guylas November 30, 2004 within 30 days.  3) The Court reviewed all the relevant facts, which it had reviewed, and sensitive to the on the ground realities of litigation with the aim of achieving a result which is just, the Court concluded that this was not a case where the application for dismissal for the plaintiff’s want for prosecution should be granted. 4) It was in the interests of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the delay. All parties were cautioned to now proceed diligently and without further delay. If the defendant will suffer serious prejudice it will no doubt cause the defendant to consider making a further application. 5) The application for the return of $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid and retained by the latter are live issues raised by the pleadings."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)Although the accused may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused and, in coming to his conclusion, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the potential seriousness of the assault, the head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and the length of time it would take to treat the victim and keep him under observation. 3)All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle pursuant to ss.255 and s253(b). 4)There was no evidence of impairment by reason of his physical condition which would justify a demand for a sample. The evidence established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. 5)The Court held that it would be unfair to deprive the accused of his s. 10(b) right to counsel in any way. Given the circumstances of the accident and the accused's condition at the scene, it was not unreasonable to expect the accused to sleep in the vehicle at the time of the demand.  6)The court found that there was no reasonable person's question as to his ability to operate the vehicle with respect to his health and safety. The only question was whether he was able to fully exercise his rights or fully exercise them when he spoke to a lawyer"

The default is deemed to be an annulment of the proposal and all funds received post-default must be distributed to the creditors.",The debtor made a consumer proposal which was accepted by his creditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was appointed Trustee under the proposal. At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted. The proposal was deemed to be annulled. PWC was taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount. The Superintendent objected on the taxation indicating that this court should review the trustee's fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. HELD: The court held that the fee should only be based on monies received from the debtor while the proposal was extant and that the fees should be permitted in the amount of $50 if PWC and the Superintendent cannot agree what should be done. The excess monies should be distributed to the creditor's who should be advised that their original debts remain receivable.

The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the ""Group Plan"") was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the applicant. Since the applicant has not retired and no pension refund exists, there appears to be no monetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by the applicant.(Emphasis added) 2)The applicant had not obtained a copy of the Plan Contract obtained by Revenue Canada and it was not known at the time of her termination if she had any assets under it. 3)The application for a restraining order was denied. 4)There was no evidence of the applicant having retired or of any of the other specified circumstances which would have resulted in a deregistering of the plan. 5)The loan agreement contained no provision enabling Crown Life with the limited right to realize on the applicant's interest in the group plan in two events. The taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(2). The provisions of sec.150 of the PPSA and sec.186 of the personal property security act are of no assistance in light of the provisions of this Act.  6)Since the applicant was not a bank director, Crown Life was entitled to deduct the outstanding loan amount from her account and to remit the balance to the designated Transferee. 7)Nothing in the plan contract or the Income tax Act prohibits the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it to her.

The respondent's primary residence was with her. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the future, the child was not allowed to relocate to Edmonton. 3) The respondent was allowed to have access to the child on one weekend per month even though his current residence was in the city of Saskatoon.

e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and the decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The mother, who had separated from the husband and was much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all of their children, had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) since the birth of the oldest child. She had been relying on the husband to protect the children from domestic disharmony and domestic violence that had been part of the pattern of living in the foster home for the past six years. The children had been and continue to be in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act. HELD: 1)The mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children. She was in denial of this or to excuse it. 2)The evidence showed that the mother was unable or unwilling to take action to protect her children. 3)The children were to be adopted. 4)The foster parents were to receive support from the Department in the form of parent aide. 5)The father was not in good health and the prognosis was not good. One of the foster parents was in poor health and there was no possibility of him being adopted. 6)It was difficult to know whether the mother's deficiencies were all to be found for the children and whether she had always been unable or unable to act on the recognition that she had failed as a parent."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and the court was of the view they had the opposite effect. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The tapes demonstrated the level of abuse in the petitioner's home. Only by hearing the tapes, could the Court truly understand the mother's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the brothers that they should become involved, alleged that the petitioner had committed an act of bankruptcy within the six months prior to their filing of the petition. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. It was common ground that the respondent had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation had been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his obligation. 2)As the petitioner was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as a professional hockey player in the NHL and had saved a total of $108,625.65 in personal tax liability.  3)It was Appropriate for the Bankruptcy Court to grant a receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner's partners as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. 4)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant such an order."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645 and costs of $1,500. The issues on appeal were whether the defendant had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order, whether the Court had the authority to order the payment of retroactive support both before and after that date, and by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The jurisprudence that questions the defendant is founded on case authority that predates such authorities as the Court of Queen's Bench. Given the wording of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order, which does not direct that an adjustment should be made as of a particular date, that issue does not arise in this appeal. 2) It is important not to confuse the two lines of authority. In Frey, it has become accepted that the Court in Frey held that there is no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order. The Court draws a clear difference between interim and final order. In Final Order, the Court held that a final order, issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement, could not be varied. The defendant has not shown that he has not been advised of changes in circumstances. 3) The defendant failed to find any unreasonable delay in his application. The court was not asked to overrule the defendant."

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car.

There was no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the defendant. This was threatening behaviour and the defendant said he felt threatened. As the complainant said in his testimony, the defendant was not there to apologize. The accused both admitted to breaking the front passenger window and breaking the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. There being no evidence of an essential element of the offence, the Court found the accused not guilty of the second count on information 24414281. 2) The Court found both the accused guilty of assault upon the complainant and wilful damage to the car. The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The court found that the first count was not guilty as the defendant choked the plaintiff at one point during the fight. The second count was found not guilty because there was no evidence that the parties were involved in any of the alleged physical or verbal fighting. The actions of the accused was aggressive. They both took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. This is not what either McIntyre or Graham used two by four to hit or kick in the window. The defendant said she did not know the plaintiff when she said that she felt threatened and that she put the plaintiff in a headlock in order to keep him around until the police arrived.  3) The photographs of the injured parties were filed. The doctor's examination revealed that the complainant had the following injuries: two centimetre laceration to his right eyebrow; two wounds on his chin; two centimeter diameter horizontal bruise and three centimetres post neck bruise on his scalp.  4) The injuries were not consistent with the actions taken by the two accused. The plaintiff was the main aggressor throughout and the actions of both accused were aggressive.  5) The defendant admitted to drinking alcohol in the evening. He admitted to getting involved in a fight"
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appeal was dismissed as there was ample evidence which supported the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the evidence of the appellant, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt."
7_1992canlii2622.txt,"The trial judge's decision fixing a retroactive effective date for child support was also upheld as there was no error on the part of the trial judge in fixing the date.,the Appeal Division upheld the trial judge's decision which did not include in the division of matrimonial assets a bank account held in the wife's name alone where the uncontradicted evidence of the wife was that the spouses had agreed when the wife went back into the work force that anything she earned would be hers. At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","This was an appeal from a corollary relief judgment dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to their effective commencement date. The appellant sought an earlier effective date so he could obtain income tax deductions for monies he said he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimony home in which he was living with the children. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in not finding that this spent money should be included in the division."
3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals the decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995. The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V.

b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The plaintiff was granted leave to appeal a decision dismissing its summary judgment application. The chambers judge found that the plaintiff had met the test for summary judgment and then that the plaintiffs met the onus on them to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident. The onus was also placed on the plaintiff to prove the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events, and if their evidence was accepted by a trier of fact, their action had some merit. The application for summary judgement was dismissed on the basis that the chambers judge blurred two parts of the test: 1) the first part was met; 2) the plaintiff met the burden placed upon him in the second part by establishing that the dog that ran onto the highway was the same dog as the plaintiff's; and 3) there was no arguable issue to be determined at trial based on the evidence attached to the affidavit. The Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test. All that was required of the plaintiffs was to show there was an issue of fact for trial and that there was credibility. The plaintiffs did not have to prove their claim was more credible or reliable than that of the defendant; and 4) the evidence was sufficiently presented through other affidavits so that a decision could be made at trial."

The respondent has costs at double Column V. The considerations to be applied in a leave to appeal application is 1)whether the issue raised by the proposed appeal is sufficiently important to the litigation before the Court or to the practice in general to warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal. 2)Whether the applicant's proposed submission to the Court of Appeal has sufficient merit to warrant the granting of leave. 3)Whether there is any delay in the proceedings which would be caused by the interjection of an appeal.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held"
b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers, including other traders or packagers, for the resale of the specialty crops. To secure the product for resale, the plaintiff entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same. The defendant attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff received a copy of the executed agreement. 2)The contract was legally binding. 3)The parties communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. 4)The impurities and hulled seed count shall be established in accordance with procedure and standards used by the Canadian Grain Commission and included as foreign material. 5)The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and confirmed that a contract did exist. The post office received the original signed contract in May 1993 and both parties considered that they had a binding and legally enforceable contract in November and in November 1993. The use of the word 'call' in the contract was not accepted. 6)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff for the costs of the sale of the canary seed."

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, Iissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. When the evidence concluded but before heard argument, issued the following fiat: order that there be nothing removed from the matrimonon home or any other assets disposed of until further ordered. The respondent did not want to cooperate with the court and sought an order pursuant to Rule 344 to prevent the respondent from violating my order of November that nothing be removed. HELD: 1)The court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications. 2)The law permits the court to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. This has long been the law in this province. 3)The prayer for relief sought a variation of the written judgment of December last. Counsel for the respondent took issue with the jurisdiction of the Court to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of the judgment had ever been issued. 4)An order requiring the respondent to return the list of items referred to above. 5)The respondent was ordered not to dispose of any of the said items without leave of Court. 6)The petitioner was given leave to exercise any legal remedy available to her to have the list returned to her including the issue of writ of delivery."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. They offered at their expense the use of their legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that there was a clear conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. HELD: The appeal was allowed and his conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. 1)The court found that the trial judge erred when he failed to strike the offending evidence, in allowing into evidence the opinion of the RCMP Traffic Analyst, the videotape re-enactment and the related still photographs. These photographs did not prove anything so it was not necessary for the defendant to object to their admission.  2)There was a lot to be gained by having the expert's report admitted into evidence. The evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court also found that some of the issues raised by the appeal court were not raised at the time of the criminal appeal. 3)A rational and justifiable choice was made to challenge the unhelpful conclusions in Cst. Thivierge's report through cross-examination rather than through an effort to have the whole report excluded from evidence."
c_2006skpc93.txt,"The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. HELD: 1)The restriction placed on the plaintiff by the defendant was not in her personal capacity. She was acting in her capacity and did not know if the work was outstanding at the time of the vote. 2)Even if the defendant's decision did infringe the plaintiff's right to expression to some extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the sections of the rural municipality act, the requirement has not been met. 3)The plaintiff was not prepared to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on her.

The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990. 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S., Ch. 11 as amended and states that the Plaintiff's only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCC. 3) The claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. 4) SaskTel was awarded costs."

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s.254(2). More specifically, whether the officer's determination that the accused motorist had 'consumed alcohol' was sufficient to bring it within the parameters of this section. HELD: 1)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2)Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. The wording of s. 254(2) is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. 3)There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, same is dismissed against the accused."

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent did not have to pay retroactive child support and that the petitioner’s position on the matter was not blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner category. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the tax returns. The respondent had been content to accept $380.00 as fair level of child support for both children.  1)There was no evidence that an agreement was struck between the parties as to the amount of support payable in the future. 2)The petitioner had no agreement with the respondent to reduce child support from $380 to $380, which represented a reduction of $80 from the table amount to offset access costs between Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 3)No written request was made by the respondent within the meaning of s.25. The petitioner was provided reasonable access. 4)Reasonable excuse for not seeking a variation was not sought. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that a petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 5)A material change in circumstance did not permit the court to pursue the same issues as the respondent. 6)The court was unable to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent failed to disclose her income tax return. 7)The respondent was not required to use tunnel vision when interpreting the evidence."

The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities.

The scales were evenly balanced. The plaintiff testified that he was driving in the turning lane and was waiting for an opportunity to make a left turn when the accident occurred.

The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the photographs were of the appellant and not the driver of the white Tempo, this would have been the situation six years earlier. It was open to the jury to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver. 3) The appellant's argument that the trial judge left the jury with an erroneous sense of their significance was undercut by numerous considerations. The R.C.M.P. sergeant who was in the patrol car with the appellant testified that he had seen the appellant driving the Tempo and that, just because the appellant did not know the appellant, it somehow followed that the driver was not called to testify. The judge's comments about the appellant's mental health and the significance of the photographs did not sufficiently neutralize the speculative aspect of her original comments."

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment, the Crown stayed counts and granted a credit of two for one for the full remand time. The accused pled guilty to three counts. The sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 incarceration for 2 years and 3 months consecutive to the preceding sentences; COUNT 3 Incarceration of 1 year and 6 months, concurrent to the previous sentences; and COUNT 4 Incorporation for 1 year, 6 months and 2 years, respectively, for the time spent on remand. HELD: The global sentence was reduced to 4 years and 9 months from the total of 9 months served. The discretion to grant the credit remained with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. 1) The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The dollar value of goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted were both aggravating. 2) There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. 3) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is that the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 4) The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served by the accused. 5) There was a further remand of 393 days in the years 2010 and 2011. However, that delay was largely the doing of the accused and that delay is largely the fault of the defence. 6) There were several other aggravating factors which must be emphasized and obtain a priority. 7) Denunciation and deterrence, both in the accused's and others' names, should be emphasized. 8) The Court must strive to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the objectives of sentencing. A fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. 9) The Crown must strive for rehabilitation. 10) There must be a high priority in the administration of justice. A credit of four years and nine months should be given to the global sentence. 11) The"
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Chambers judge arising out of an interpleader application by the respondent Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The learned trial judge held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. He also held that the respondent had priority over the rest of the claimants. Allowing the appeal and ordering the payment of the sum to the Eskasoni Band, that the appellant had failed to give proper notice of the assignment and that the subsequent purchasers were protected. The Chambers judge also agreed with the conclusions reached in Kozak that the assignment was subject to statutory disclosure and the return of the funds to the respondent would be in no higher or better position than if the Act had been passed."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location and destroyed the plaintiff's building. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the building in May of 2010 and moved to a new location. The plaintiff sought production of all documents relating to the second fire. Specifically: a complete copy of any investigative files prepared by government authorities including the Fire Marshall and the Town of Stellarton Fire Department; any photographs of the aftermath of the fire; any internal investigation, any of the file of any insurers who carried out investigations; and all of the relevant documents. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings 2 years apart did not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating the second blaze. To order disclosure of the documents at this stage of the proceedings without further evidence would only serve to sanction a fishing expedition, as stated by Justice LeBlanc in Murphy vs. Lawtons Drugs Stores Limited, 2010 NSSC 289. As a result the motion was dismissed. Costs to the defendant in the amount of $750 were awarded."
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift a stay, and to maintain the schedule existing before the decision under appeal. Accordingly, the parties are to be governed by the order of Wright J. unless otherwise agreed and until further order. HELD: On this application in the entirety of the Court of Appeal, the judge did not make the decision in light of the relatively short time period between the time the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, but because notice of appeal in relation to those reasons was filed almost immediately, Wright J.'s order came into effect and has been in effect for the past 2 weeks. The parties are now in week no. 1 of the court hearing the appeal.  1) On the application in this case the court referred to Gerwing v.A. who decided, on an interim basis, prior pre-judgment reasons, not lift the stayed, and that the final reason filed by the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.''s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Court of appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. 2) While there have been only two occasions when the children did not have access to both parents in any six-day period, there has been one occasion only during that period when the mother did not order either the father or the mother to pay maintenance.

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings committed in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006. The two accused remained in custody until October 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. HELD: The sentence is one of years, months incarceration.  1) An aggravating factor is that handguns were used in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar known as Vegas. Quite a few shots were fired and two persons died as result of the gunfire. The offender was acquitted of the two counts and he is not being sentenced for those offences today. 2) Another aggravating factors is that a bullet found its way into an occupied residence across the road from the after-hours bar. There was a serious threat to the safety and security of those living in that residence as well as those who were congregated on the outside porch of the bar shortly before the shooting. The accused had been prohibited from possessing firearms in the area where the shootings occurred. The evidence in the present case points to the presence of at least 2, probably handguns being fired at him.

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The first issue before the court arises from the voir dire and concerns whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant. The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the warrant to search for blood samples issued pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was invalid. The warrant was invalid and there was a breach of the accused's s.8 rights. The officer who swore the information to Obtains Blood samples was granted leave to cross-examine on the voiry dire. The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient grounds to admit into evidence. The Certificate of Analysis was not sufficient to warrant the admission of the blood samples but rather constituted a violation of the officer’s rights under s. 24(2) and s. 7 of the charter. The Lieutenant-Colonel was not required to provide sufficient detail to permit the justice to determine the appropriate statutory pre-conditions. The lieutenant-colonel knew all of the information when he applied for the warrant but failed to communicate it basic information to the Justice. The accused was not the only person at the scene of the accident who could have been presumed to be the driver of the vehicle. There were witnesses at the site of the crash and the Crown had advised the Justice that there had been a person fleeing from the vehicle when the officer testified. HELD: 1) The officer was granted fair and proper treatment by the court and the court found that the officer had grave concerns about the integrity of the police database, the reliability of the source of the evidence and the adequacy of the disclosure by the Justice of the Peace Boychuk in his analysis of the relevant information.  2) The information which the officer deposed in the Information To Obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under ss. 253 and 253. The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid because the officer did not depose that he believed that the sole occupant of the motor vehicle, who was not wearing a seat belt, was in good condition to consent to the taking of samples of blood and that witnesses had not seen anyone flee from the overturned vehicle.  3) There was a relatively narrow basis for exclusion as the officer knew all the information and communicated all of it to the justice. The information must be considered in light of the factors set out in R. v. Laporte"
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court, which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could be varied after payment. For the appellant and the respondent, that there was a jurisdictional question concerning the payment of lump sum in 1985 which had not been paid back. The respondent had made no further payment since that time and had not had contact with the child. In 1993 the appellant made an application for variation of this order pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses was a unique creation of the old Children of Unmarried Parents Act and was governed by the principles of that Act, which are outside the legislative scheme of the Federal Maintenance Act. The Respondent appealed the decision. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial de novo, that the order was not determinative of the issue but rather a finding of fact in the history of the court and the factors favouring the claimant."

HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care. The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT. Both parents wanted sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy had lived alternating weeks with each parent. HELD: The father's obligation under the Federal Child Support Guidelines was $226 per month. He asked the mother to share the extraordinary cost of $40 per month for the boy's horse lessons which were part of his school routine. She also asked the father to share $40 in the cost of horse riding lessons.

5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and did not make an application for a pension. In October 1996, DND, without the plaintiff's involvement, re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the government claiming that under s. 4(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act no action lies against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable' until the individual accepts the Minister's denial but believes for reasons unrelated to the pension application they are entitled to relief or remedy, and the Canada Pension Commission has granted the 'award' of pension in the applicant's favour'. The Crown argued that s. 111 of the Pension Act or s. 48 of the Liability & Proceedings Act could not be read having regard to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bringing an action in the civil action claiming that she is now entitled to pension. HELD: The action was allowed to proceed. The limitation period for appealing the Ministers' decision had expired and the plaintiff was not in receipt of pension benefits. 1)Section 111 is a statutory defence and the Crown could not meet that onus because the plaintiff had never made an application. 2)The Crown did not meet the onus on the admitted facts that it could not bring the case within the ambit of the Act. 3)The doctrine that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to court actions has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance. 4)S. 111 is not a bar to the proceedings in the sense that the plaintiff did not pursue the administrative process in favor of civil action and the Court held that they had to pursue the same process. 5)In the present case the plaintiff has not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or the Queen's Regulations the remedies provided therein and the court would not have any jurisdiction as result of s. 18 of the Federal Courts Act."

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded on January 14, 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. Dismissing the appeal, that the Act does not give the aircraft situs there to support tax which constitutionally must be 'within the Province'. In the case of aircraft operations, there must be substantial, at least more than nominal, presence in order to provide a basis for imposing tax in respect of the entry of aircraft into the province."" This is an appeal by the Minister of Finance under the Health Services Tax Act. The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon, 1943 CanLII 372 (UK JCPC), [1943] D.L.R. (4th) 218 (S.C.C.) and later generalized to include all tangible personal property. The primary purpose of s. 2(4) is to guard against the methods of avoidance of the purchase tax. It is a provision which, if enacted, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121. All Articles of Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall be admitted free into each of the other provinces. This predominant purpose, in the view of the Board, was to prevent the evasion of the tax and consequent loss of revenue by the simple expedient of consumer purchasing goods outside the province for his own consumption or use."
3_2003skqb257.txt,"The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan. He became ill while teaching a class. His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's claim for compensation based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s.30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had been performing work duties while on campus to attend class or to study. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The court considered the privative clause found in s.22 of the Act and concluded that the standard of review will generally be one of patent unreasonableness. 2)Section 45(1)(b) is not to be applied. Section 45 is to set out the circumstances in which the respondent died and the policies must not take the Board beyond the discretion afforded to them by the statute. 3)The respondent Board's decision to deny the application on the basis that the applicant failed to give notice was the correctness standard rather than the patent unreasonable one. 4)Section 7 of The Workers’ Compensation Act was amended in 1979 to provide for compensation to workers for injuries sustained in the course of their employment. 5)Section 8(1) was to be amended in 1981 to include the provision that allowed the Board to determine whether a deceased spouse’s death was a result of an injury. 6)Section 9(2) was not to bar the Board from making its decision based upon the circumstances set out in the legislation. 7)Section 11(3) is to be used where the board had complete discretion to make its decision. 8)Section 12(1), which provides for the equitable sharing of costs between the employer and the applicant, is to not bar the board from making their decision on a case by case basis. 9)In the case of the respondent Board, the decision to grant benefits to the applicant was based upon alternative grounds, which included the fact the respondent had not notified the Board of its decision in the first place. 10)Section 47 does not bar a person from compensation where the Board considers that the claim is just and should be allowed. 11)In this case, the reasons for the delay were the same as in the respondent board decision in November"

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program was able to accommodate such attendance.

He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused pled guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and was sentenced to a term of 6 months imprisonment and to enter into a probation order for an 18 month term of 18 months on certain specific conditions.

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between her and the husband in August 2004. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. The father agreed to the terms in order to keep his child in the home. He believed the agreement of joint custody would protect his interests. 2) There was no evidence to suggest that mobility would become an issue at some point. 3) The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 4) The father failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause. Instead of explicitly indicating his intent he assumed the joint custody order would protect him. The terms of their agreement clearly favoured the mother; the father gave the consideration required to finalize their agreement but did not ensure he was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. 5) The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances of the parties the court can review the terms of the separation agreement in this divorce proceeding and set an appropriate amount of support."

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate it was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence was to the effect that when stopped by the police he was suffering from a panic attack.

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation and certification of the 1,700 pages of transcript she wanted to put before the court on her 2nd and 3rd appeals. The respondents' motions to dismiss her Criminal Appeal and to have them pay to certify the transcripts were granted. HELD: The Court dismissed the appellant's two appeals and ordered the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcripts.  1) The appellant had not filed her material on time. The personal circumstances she describes are difficult. But there is no suggestion that she will change. 2) The Court dismisses both appeals for failure to perfect.

e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at or near.08. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he did not do. 3)Although the accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly, the officer noted that it was windy at the time, which may have caused him to weave somewhat in his lane and he was required to slow and pull over to the shoulder as he passed the vehicle in the immediate vicinity. 4)The court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused. 5)The Court found that the accused had not displayed any symptoms of impairment contrary to the Crown's standard of care and that his appearance was not affected by the alcohol consumption.

No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed.

When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The child protection proceeding in respect of the child who was under the age of six when taken into care was delayed for a number of reasons. The primary child protection concerns that were advanced by the agency were such that the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial date is after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. 2)The trial date was near the outside deadline. There was good reason for the matter to be extended for a trial beyond the date of the overall deadline. 3)Any attempt to make an order after trial that operates beyond any statutory time deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. 4)The Court has not lost its jurisdiction in this matter. The trial will commence tomorrow."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with a number of offences, including robbery with a firearm. The police stopped the car and found the accused in it minutes after it was stopped in Fairview. The accused pleaded guilty to the robbery and the possession of the gun and brass knuckles. At trial, the accused testified that he had not been in Sackville at all and had nothing to do with any robbery. She said that the police had stopped to pick up people from the house where the robbery took place and the accused had been picked up just few minutes before. The defence argued that the accused's failure to identify him during the trial resulted in a reasonable doubt as to his involvement with the robbery. HELD: The court found that the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious. He was found in the car with a hand gun under the seat and with the stolen property, and he was in the back seat with the person he described as the'mastermind' to the gun. The circumstantial evidence did not support the conclusion that the Crown had committed a robbery beyond the range of a few months. It was reasonable to expect the Crown to have a reasonable chance of proving the first two men were the same people who robbed the accused. The court also found that although the accused admitted to doing the robbery, he was not the only person who was involved, the crime was more than foreseeable given the time period between the robbery report being called in to the take down by the police and the police. The Crown should have shown the court the car that was stopped on Northwest Arm Drive and the statement given by the defence counsel that it was the one that picked up the accused and the two young men that were in the vehicle after the police stopped it in high risk take down and that their identities would be determined based on the descriptions provided by the witnesses."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was found not guilty on all of the counts. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood sold to the undercover officer was wood coming from Crown lands. Therefore, the conviction should be quashed. The Court of Queen's Bench stated that it was not satisfied that during the period the defendant harvested wood from Crown land and that he also sold wood from private lands, the Crown should not have taken this as an admission, as it was clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that the parties could appeal an arbitrators' decision based on the very limited nature of potential appeals. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that they cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)The use of the word 'arbitration' in the meaning of s.45(2) of the Act does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying', in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 3)The agreements signed with HAL did not provide for the right of appeal on questions of law. The terms of the agreement set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution, and the parties intentionally 'contracted out' of it."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The defendant engaged two experts who examined the piece of Metal and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The plaintiff argued that the experts' reports did not support the claim and that there was no issue to be tried. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The defendant failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. 2)There must be a real distinction or difference of evidence requiring the court to make a finding of negligence against the defendant driver, having considered the body of evidence that is before me. The court found that the defendant had met the threshold test and that he did not meet it. 3)The plaintiff failed to demonstrate a real issue for trial. There was no genuine issue for the cause of action. The pleadings and the expert reports were all bare allegations. 4)No trial date was ordered. 5)Costs of the application were left to the trial judge."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina, breasts and buttocks numerous times over top of her clothing. He also touched her inappropriately in the bedroom. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)There was reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The complainant's evidence was disbelieved. There was no credible evidence that he sexually assaulted or harassed the complainant. The circumstantial evidence was that he was drunk. He was not known to work outside the home. It was reasonable to expect that he would be guilty of some of the offences alleged. Although he did not have a criminal record, the evidence was not so reasonable that it would confirm his guilt. 2)The accused did not pose a danger to the public. The absence of any complaint by the complainant to her mother might be consistent with her fear that the accuse would leave and take the baby with him but the lack of complaint is also consistent with his innocence. 3)Although there was reasonable evidence surrounding his behaviour, it was not enough to convict him of his crimes. The Crown did not provide sufficient evidence to convict the accused of his most dangerous offences."

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. The evidence from the father's witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother. HELD: Custody and access were granted to the father with a review date. The information provided by the father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was credible. The court found that the information presented by the Mother and her witnesses was credible and the information would assist in determining the appropriate set-off amount. Decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their future were to be made by the Father. He was to pay $502 per month. This payment was to commence January 1, 2012."

He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences relating to careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy. He also contended that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. HELD: The appellant was released on terms set out in R. v. Renacci. The Crown opposed his release primarily on the basis that he was flight risk; that he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate. Allowing the appeal, that the appellant had met the onus on him to comply with his release terms. The circumstances that the Crown suggested made him a flight risk had nothing to do with the charges he had faced or the convictions that had resulted; his professional obligations had not resulted in his release."

The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application for exclusion was dismissed.  1)It is in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time.  2)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 3)There will be instances where defence counsel will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation. There will, however, be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  4)In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made in May 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991.

This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Michael resumed living with the mother and was supported by his grandmother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly causes their children. 2)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is necessary that there be a shared parenting regime in place, it is not necessary that the parties live together for the foreseeable future. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9. 3)Sole custody arrangements and s. 7 expenses are to be determined by taking into account the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses; the increased costs associated with the shared custody arrangements; and the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each parent and child for whom support is sought. 4)Discretion is given to review all of the relevant circumstances in an attempt to achieve a fair standard of support for the children."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment in September 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were: 1) the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count in convicting the appellant; 2) the trial judge failed to accept the evidence of the central Crown witness, who provided exculpatory evidence; and 3) the appellant did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence."

c_2005skpc55.txt,"The plaintiff student argues that she was unjustly dismissed and so sues the defendant business for wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She earned $657.83. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $2,083.73.","The plaintiff sought wages that she would have earned had she worked to the end of the term of her employment. The defendant, which operated a business and sold investments, argued that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. The employer sought to recover the value of the plaintiff's lost income. HELD: The dismissal was dismissed without just cause.  1)The plaintiff made a reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment. She received employment income in the amount of $2,592.00 and she received days of training as receptionist. 2)She was not advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in her dismissal. 3)The defendant did not provide the plaintiff with any notice that her employment would be terminated. She was only entitled to nominal notice which, in the circumstances, it could not be said that she was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of such a fundamental nature respecting office policies. There was just cause for dismissal without cause."
5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the defendant to withdraw his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and leave to him to commence derivative action in the name of the company for alleged misdeeds of the defendants. The defendant had previously been a director at the defendant company. He had left in 2003 and was involved in a cause of action in defamation against the defendant. At issue was whether the defendant had the right to commence a derivative action based upon the allegations in the statement of claim and whether he was entitled to copies of any offers made to purchase the plaintiff. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. 1)The court found that new counsel's need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts is a strong reason for concluding it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. There were no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the request.  2)The defendant had been a shareholder for many years. He led the company from 1985 to 1986. He was only a shareholder from October 1985 to July 1986. His rights as an existing shareholder were suspended by the consent order and not his rights as a former shareholder. 3)There was no temporal connection between the defendant's shareholding and the acts of oppression. 4)The judge did not apply wrong principle or make an unjust order. The parties agreed that a judicial admission should be allowed to be withdrawn if, in the circumstances, the court is satisfied it is in the interest of justice to do so."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Crown applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code. The Chambers judge granted the release with conditions, pending the appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. The applicant argued the judge misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application. He argued this is a case of first impression and raised issues that should be considered by a panel of the Court of Appeal. Allowing the release, that the decision of the Chambers judge was misinterpreted and that the issue of whether or not a person on a day parole is in custody would never have arisen if the appellant was serving his time in custody in Penitentiary rather than in custody. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that the appellant, who was on parole at the relevant time of his application, was not in custody, therefore, the court had jurisdiction to hear the appellant's application for judicial interim release (R. v. Wood). The Crown sought to re-open the trial on a parole board basis and sought a direction in the direction of the Chief Justice on the basis that the previous 679 decision had been misinterpreted. In a written decision, the judge concluded that the Crown had a first impression that the applicant was not actually in custody when the trial application was made and that he was not on parole when it was done. The Crown appealed that decision. In his decision, Judge Cromwell also stated that a review of the original decision could not be undertaken on the grounds that it was a matter for the court of appeal alone. In this case, Crown counsel raised a number of issues that he would raise if a review was ordered. The appeal judge's decision was appealed and the Crown sought a change in the circumstances of the trial to a different time period. In the appeal, Crown Counsel also sought a request for a writ of certiorari in order to determine whether the chambers judge erred in law in ruling that at the appropriate time the application for re-entry of the appellant in s. 670 of the criminal code was made, was in custody within the meaning of s. 779 of that Code.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been placed in the care of the psychological father because of instability in the home, the risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child, and that there was a risk of the child suffering harm as a result of the abuse. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b) and 3(1) of s. 45 for the purposes of protection finding. Testimony was received from the mother, child protection worker, the biological father, the mother's sister and a psychologist. HELD: 1) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this is clearly on the Agency. It is a civil burden that must have regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision. 2) The child was apprehended in April 2004 because of unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The apartment was in disarray and the mother was living alone. The parties did not cooperate in addressing the risk factors that affected the child's health and safety. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the extent to which the respondent's actions were in breach of the provisions of the Act. It was unnecessary to ask the court to return the child who had been removed from her care and who had not been apprehended by the Agency prior to that date. 4) Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent the respondent. The respondent's attendance at a risk management conference meeting was limited to two people. 5) The respondent was not prepared to participate in any counselling sessions. 6) Counseling was not available to the parties. 7) The court was unable to decide whether or not to order the respondent to pay child support or to provide counselling. 8) Counsel must consult with the Agency as to the extent that the respondent will be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondent in the event of an application for review."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established by the Supreme Court of Canada. 2)The applicant waived or part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable. 3)There was no evidence that the accused waived any of his rights, explicitly or implicitly. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of a breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss.8 and s9 charter motions and leads evidence to the contrary, the court found that prejudice can be inferred on the basis that the length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Chambers judge did not err in determining the lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. The reverse onus provision did not apply. The appellants had filed an affidavit arguing that the lease was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.62 of the Act and that the responding plaintiff failed to show that he was an owner pursuant to that provision. The affidavit also argued that Chrysler was not acting as a servant or agent of the owner of the vehicle at the time of the accident. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case.  1)The Chambers judge correctly cited the test in Bazley (see Bazley). The test is whether the law of vicarious liability extends to leasing companies, whether the lease falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of owner. 2)There was no material facts in dispute. The material facts were not in dispute and the record as to what occurred prior to and in the presence of the panel was evident from the transcript of the hearings and the answers to interrogatories. 3)The lease agreement fell into the category of'rental contract' under the Act as it did not have strict liability in its own right and did not comply with any of the conditions set out in the Act. There were no issues of credibility and no need to weigh the evidence with respect to the version of events. 4)The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak), which speak directly to the situation. The lease contains the characteristics noted in sec. 2 (ak). It cannot realistically be depicted as a rental Contract as defined in s 62. 5)The only issue on appeal was whether Chrysler had a real chance to succeed on appeal on the undisputed facts.  6)Costs to the plaintiff were awarded to the insurer. 7)The court was satisfied that the issue was unambiguously determined by the precedents."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike his estranged wife with a motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. 1)The Court found that the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown proven the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. The offence was proved where the Crown established the driving complained of was dangerous to public. The accused's evidence was seriously attacked on cross-examination and gave evidence which differed substantially from his previous statement to the RCMP. On the evidence, the Crown had proven the accused to be guilty of each and every ingredient of the offence to the satisfaction of the reasonable doubt. 2)There was no evidence that bodily harm was caused to the victim.

He was charged in the matter of assault causing bodily harm and assault with weapon, to wit a beer bottle. 2)There was no evidence presented at trial as to the manner in which the accused was killed.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act.  1)It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time that the parents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia, the child is to have his access time with the father for the remainder of August, according to the terms of her decision. The mother acknowledged that this would be in the best interests of the child if he were placed in the custody of his mother. 2)The factors leading the court to lift the stay were access, access and access. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, was of considerable concern. The school year will commence shortly and in that respect the child can settle into routine and schedule during the school year, pending the hearing of the appeal."

A custody investigation conducted in 1990 when the mother had first commenced this application had recommended that the existing arrangement be continued. The Father now intended, however, to move with the children to Ontario to take additional education. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. The appellants argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, or in law by conflating foreseeability with proximity. They also argued that case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of the Respondent's lawyer did not establish a common issue within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Class Actions Act. Dismissing the application with leave, that the proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of this Court. It is not plain and obvious that the representative plaintiff had no cause of action against the lawyer. Furthermore, evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by the lawyer as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. The Chambers judge made no errors in this regard."

2001skqb485.txt,"The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result of the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir de dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. There must be a valid objective served by the search. This must be one of the purposes for a valid search incident to arrest, the normal threshold that must be surpassed before search can be conducted. Here the only requirement is that there be some reasonable basis for doing what the police officer did. The reasonable expectation of privacy concept has worked well in Canada. If there were any violations of the accused's rights under the Charter, the police have considerable leeway in the circumstances of an arrest which they do not have in other situations. To exclude the evidence in question would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for child support purposes is $59,500 gross per annum. In December 2002, Justice Dickson terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for the parties' oldest child, Corry and ordered that in addition to ongoing support for two youngest children, the payment of s. 8 expenses was also terminated. The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses. In addition, he is to pay 66% of the pediatric and spousal expenses.  2) In September 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated Mr. Alm's obligation for support effective October 1, 2005. He found that Corry had not paid support for Corry in the past 3 years. In September 2004, Justice Wilkinson of this Court granted a consent order extending the respondent s.7 expenses for the 2005/06 university year. The costs relating to the computer and the crisis prevention class were legitimate s7 costs. It was uncontroverted that the petitioner has disabilities which necessitate certain tools such as a computer and internet access for both girls. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under the Table support. Accordingly, that expense shall be disallowed. 3) The petitioner's s.8 education expenses for 2005/2006 are $7,123.72 calculated using the university fall and spring terms and 3,002.94 as their s.6 expenses.

8_2003nspc17.txt,"The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid. Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have issued; that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The evidence was compelling. Noting the progression of dates in each succeeding paragraph of the Information, accept D/Cst. Collyer's testimony and find that it is reasonable to conclude that the year 2001 in the penultimate paragraph was a typographical error and was intended to read '2002'. The four apparently separate and independent sources over the month and a half prior to the warrant application all confirmed, with varying amounts of detail, that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both. There was evidence on which the police could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the application. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. The information was based on a tip originating from outside the police, was that source credible, and was the information corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. In this process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant but rather than being a separate test, their sole impact is to determine whether there was any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge."

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 and 9. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of Kyle's trial. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1) The accused's Charter application in relation to the cell phone did not associate him with it and entitles him at trial to demand that the Crown prove the phone is his. 2) The essential issue on the firearms possession charges is whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey sawed-off shotgun, and ammunition in a careless manner. The intercepts are also of pivotal importance to the firearms trafficking charges. 3) The Court was unable to accept that the accused can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s. 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 4) There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. The evidence led by the Crown had established that the phone with the number 229-4400 was the accused's cell phone. 5) The evidence introduced as evidence in this trial was not the ones located in the accused’s and Torina Lewis’ home. 6) The statements of the accused and the documentary exhibits entered through or referred to by them left the court with no doubt about the continuity and integrity of the exhibit."

Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital.

Baig. 2) Absent proof of circumstances indicating that the accused did not understand his right to retain counsel when informed of the right, the onus has to be on him to prove that he asked for the right but it was denied or denied or he was denied any opportunity to even ask for it. The accused demonstrated an honest and reasonable understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. There was no evidence of misapprehension as to his level of intoxication at the time of driving.  3) Although his degree of alertness may have been fluctuating and his emotions unstable, he nevertheless displayed an understanding of the situation through actions and words spanning a period of a significant time.  4) There is no medical evidence to support the conclusion that the Court would require a waiver of any right to counsel in the circumstances of this case.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise. The second application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. It is indicative that the accused's decision whether to testify would be in the interests of justice. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The other is that the evidence admissible on one count will influence the verdict on an unrelated count. The Crown has given shape to the broad criteria established in s. 591(3) and have identified factors that can be weighed when deciding whether to sever or not. The weighing exercise ensures that a reasonable balance is struck between the risk of prejudice to the accused and the public interest in a single trial. In this case of 21 counts, the court has had the benefit of watching a videotaped interview of the accused conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or on April 14. Defence counsel argues that this disclaimer is indicative of a person's intention to testify on both matters but not in respect of the status offences. At the same time, it is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8th counts and thereby be exposed to cross-examination on the April 14th charges. The court must engage in a weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether or not severance (see Last at paras. 16-18). It is important to remember that just because multiple offences are committed close in time, or just because offences involve behaviour that could be admissible in proof of some issue at the trial of another offence, does not necessarily set aside the need for a severance application."

The primary parent status quo is Lesly. The child has a strong bond with her father and his family. However, there is no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education.

However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. Costs in the cause are in the amount of $150 for the trip from Regina to Victoria. There was conflicting affidavits as to the extent of Lesly's involvement with the child but the affidavits indicate that she was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing the child and shared other parental duties with the father. The father would like the child to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. Lesly will advise the child if she will travel to Victoria for parenting time with her or if she chooses to parent in Victoria. The issue of mobility is to be determined by reference to Gordon v.

The applicant shall pay the respondent for the cost of transporting the child (the petitioner shall pay Lesly by 9:30 a.m. of the 28th day of the trial) and the petitioner shall provide to the other telephone numbers where the child may be reached and shall make the applicant available for such telephone access. There shall be no changes in the current parenting pattern until trial and thereafter shall be similar in pattern to that in the respondent"
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. They lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the conclusion of the relationship, L.M. became the custodial parent and the parties' children were placed in the supervised care of T.B. who was given permission to return to Nova Scotia in 2006. Upon L'M.'s application, an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act prevented the children from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The children's protection history was not disclosed to the Agency until six weeks after the children had moved to Alberta. HELD: 1)The information concerning the children was simply not germane to the decision made by the Agency. 2)The documents contained historical references only and related, not to, the Agency, the children's father, and to his common law partner. 3)The Agency actively supported the placement of the children in defiance of the Nova Scotia supervision order because of K.B.'s wishes. The respondent did not participate at the disposition review, although he participated in previous hearings. 4)The agency had failed to disclose relevant information to the parties and to the court. 5)There was a serious concern that the children would not be able to sustain whatever gains they made over time. Therefore, it was necessary for the Agency to undertake an extensive re-examination of its child protection history.  6)The oldest child, who was the primary caregiver and the only child protection advocate, had a history of violent outbursts and extreme abuse to staff. The younger child was prone to extreme temper tantrums. The older child was more prone to violence. Support for the younger child had been given to her in the form of a letter to the effect that the older child would no longer be in the custody of the Agency if the protection order were lifted. The letter also stated that the Agency would not terminate its involvement with the child C.B., who had been living with her mother in a small residence and had threatened to run away if forced to do so.  7)It was clear that the oldest child had significant concerns about his protection history and that his relationship with his common-law partner (L.M.) had not been fully resolved at the time of the initial disposition review. It was also clear that communication was difficult between the Agency and the children. It would appear that the agency was not responding appropriately to the concerns of the parents."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused's version of the incident in the general office differed significantly from that of the complainant. The accused responded to an invitation from the police to attend at the police station. He said he believed that the matter was closed and that he would return his call. She was required to specifically describe a number of incidents that took place over a period of about year and then year after the last of the incidents had taken place and believed her recollection was accurate. She believed that he was only joking and that there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  3) While there is some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21, the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003."
e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","Applicant asks for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: 1) The applicant has and will continue to experience financial difficulty to such an extent that (he) will be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed.  2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability.  3) He does not have the resources to discharge this liability now, nor in the next several years."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two children. The father and his wife, both medical professionals, claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing them. HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered that the trial be held in Unified Family Court. The Court found that the statements were made with express malice, which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. The facts brought into conflict different fundamental societal interests: society's interest in the protection of children from abuse, society's Interest in preventing a trial in which 'no party wins all parties lose', and the common interest of the people who make such communications. The allegations were found to be intrinsically evidence of malice. The co-defendants, who had obtained a consent order directing compensatory Christmas access to the children, libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father and were negligent in the preparation of the reports."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being held in Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff did not have a cause of action against the defendants but that the defendants acted in good faith by insisting on the use of a properly functioning air conditioning cart in the flight. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the onus is on the plaintiffs, on certification application, to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose causes of action, it is not very high onus. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no action. The Court should be reluctant to deny a plaintiff his or her day in court. Although the plaintiff would have been ousted in this situation, all allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. There is a remedy for that damage provided for in the Warsaw Convention. The case of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd., which involved a claim against commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package tour operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing, and an order pursuant to s. 4(2)(b) of The Class Action Act appointing myself as Justice of the Court to hear the certification Application pursuant to section or if the court is satisfied that the express terms of contract as between the tour operator and the plaintiff were not being met. The generous approach to be adopted on this application is to set aside the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor, which has no application to the facts of this case. Although it is common to see a plaintiff plead for damages against a defendant for negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement, there is no case law with regard to its predecessor, the Warsaw convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. In this case, the plaintiff submitted that all of the alleged damages alleged by the defendants were the result of actions that he or she had performed within the scope of his employment."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother proposed that Kody be registered in the Sylvan Learning Centre during the summer of 2007 due to his educational difficulties. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay. HELD: 1)The child support application was dismissed. 2)The childcare costs were necessary and reasonable. The cost of the Childview program, with childcare costs of $7,800 per year, Sylvan learning centre costs at $1,261, income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085, the mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 forthwith. 3)The preschool costs and the Learning Centre costs were both within the father's means. The child support payment by the father was reduced to $472 per month. 4)The cost of child care was reduced by $8,000 to $1 million per year. 5)The costs of the childcare were included in the cost of living for the children. 6)The Education expenses were reasonable. If the father paid this amount in addition to his s. child support amount, he would have net monthly cash flow of $2,066 while the mother and four children would have available cash flows in the amount of $3,700. 7)In the matter before me, the Court ordered s.15.3(1) of the Divorce Act to give priority to child support in determining child support applications. It was found that the father had not made reasonable child support payments as of February 2007. 8)Although the father has been voluntarily providing child support to the Mother, at least since February 2007, she was required by the petitioner to bring the matter to the pre-trial. She did not file enough evidence regarding the circumstances of the child's special needs. She could not, thus, make a decision regarding any extraordinary expenses for the special needs of the four children.  9)The Court ordered that the following items be paid to the petitioner pursuant to s.7(1)(d): extraordinary costs for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that"
7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Creditor's Group. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are 'public money' within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act and the Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While it is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life with the potential of continuing to earn interest rather than be placed on deposit with the Court, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily need to be recognized. 3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate manner of addressing the surplus, it appears that Empire Life has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of the insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim to the surplus by the insurer, Ag Credit, that the surplus has always been and remains the property of the Crown. 4) The principles of the Saskatchewan Insurance Act, s. 254(1) of the Creditors' Guidelines governing group insurance provided that: all real or personal property and all money acquired, administered, possessed or received by the corporation is, for all purposes, including taxation of whatever nature and description, deemed to be within the confines of that Act. 5) The phrase public money is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The insurer may apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court or make appropriate orders as directed by the Court; and 6) The insurer would be entitled to receive, on pro rata, any life insurance premiums that were written off as these premiums were paid."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a one-year probation order. During argument on behalf of the appellant, it was suggested that the trial judge made three errors of law leading to the conviction. One of those errors amounted to an error of law; (i) he referred to photographs depicting the extent, location and nature of injuries suffered by the complainant when no photographs of them were tendered in evidence; (b) he misapplied the test in determining credibility; and (c) there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. HELD: The appeal was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan.  1) The trial judge failed to properly consider the defence of necessity. He erred in law by misapplying the test for a defence against necessity. 2) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction or to substitute a conviction under s. 686. It would be appropriate to substitute the conviction for a conviction. 3) It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. Some of the injuries she claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall appeared to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the Produce Department. The occupier used reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' and was therefore contributorily negligent. 3)The plaintiff did not contest the presence of a large amount of water in the vicinity of where she fell although it did not concede that it was the water that caused the plaintiff to slip. There were numerous cases that found slippery substances such as rain, snow, ice and laces in the area. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water. The defendants did not adduce evidence confirming that he had in fact cleaned the floor at 2:52 p.m. and made the entry on the sweep log. 4)There were many cases in which a slippery substance, or produce, in a grocery store, can constitute an 'extraordinary danger' which, in the absence of an explanation, party fails to adduced the evidence of witness who would have knowledge of the facts and who would be assumed to be willing to assist that party. An adverse inference may be drawn against a party who does not call material witness over whom he or she has exclusive control and does not explain it away. Such failure is said to amount to an implied admission that the evidence would be contrary to the party's case, or at least would support it (see Murray v. City of Saskatoon). 5)There was no evidence that the defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff on July 24, 2001."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The mother had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief. She had refused post-natal health services, and had avoided contact with child welfare agencies for three months prior to the offence. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown and defence agreed the appropriate range of sentencing for manslaughter was four to 12 years. The issues were framed by the arguments and cases submitted by the parties. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of the first two grounds: 1) that the sentencing judge did not give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability and 2) that there were mitigating factors including the mother's dysfunctional upbringing, her mental disorder which resulted from that background, and her social and economic situation. These factors led to the conclusion that post-traumatic stress disorder was a mitigating factor and that the sentence imposed would not be appropriate given the range of sentences imposed for offences of this nature. The sentencing judge also failed to take into account the factors the mother had previously been convicted of, namely, having been sexually assaulted and domestic abuse. These are significant mitigating factors that warrant a reduction in sentence. 2) The sentence imposed on the respondent was found to be in the range prescribed by the Province in R. v. Hathway, [6] which held that it is appropriate to impose a sentence with a factor of four years less a day to be followed by two years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence as demonstrably unfit."

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. The surety was to be responsible for the sum of $1,000. The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not be just nor appropriate to order forfeiture on the basis that the accused had not been made aware of what was expected of him and the possible consequences of his actions; 2) the accused should have had an opportunity to read the document before signing it and the obligations being assumed and the potential consequences in the event of default should have been explained to him or her. As the accused already had enough on his plate and was experiencing enough negative factors, he should not have signed the document.  3) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in his eventual return to the province. It seems to me that it would be just and appropriate to have forfeiture ordered against the accused or the surety."

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct that the applicant have counsel appointed to him. The application is accordingly dismissed. 2)The court was of the view that the learned youth court judge failed not to err when he refused to direct him to the applicant's counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew.  3)The discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. Inability may be asserted for other reasons and the court is entitled to inquire into the foundation. In R. v. B.W., [1997] B.C.J.

3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land in 1993 by the City Council passed a resolution to expropriate it for the purpose of widening the Bedford Highway. The land was approximately 10 feet of the 30-foot rear yard for retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 with the work beginning in June 1994. At the end of the work, the appellant advised the City that it intended to abandon the land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. City council approved the abandonment in October 1994. The solicitor for the appellant rendered a solicitor-client account to the City in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The Taxing Master was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant. The appellant's appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs by the taxing master confirmed.  1)The appellant had no liability for any costs associated with the solicitor and client taxation and the fact that the matter was settled did not result in a denial of costs. 2)Taxing officers are not to be interfered with on appeal unless and until it is shown that they fell into error by the exercise of some wrong principle. 3)A judge's fundamental consideration in statutory interpretation is the role of the solicitor. Consideration must be given to both the spirit and letter of the legislation. In this case, the appellants suggest that the City disallowed any services that were actually incurred, but as a result of design changes, was located entirely within the original street width, leaving only the footings protruding into the claimant's property. 4)In a previous case the appellant had made an offer for full compensation for the unpaid legal services rendered by the appellant in regard to the disposal of the respondent's (expropriation) property. 5)The respondent's accountant was taxed by the city for $20,000 and the solicitor's account was taxed at $7,000. 6)It is common practice for almost all commercial accounts to have some reference to interest on overdue balances stated on invoices. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such costs. Some of the research should be chalked up to gaining of experience in this specific field of law."

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice of vacate served on the tenant was set aside. Although one of two joint owners can serve notice to vacate, the section that the Landlord relies upon is only available to periodic Tenancies and Mr. Koch is the sole owner of the property. Even if there wasn’t a lease, the landlord and tenant signed a 3-year lease. The tenant argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The landlord appealed; certain circumstances where a landlord’s right of tenancy to a tenant had lapsed, such as breach of trusts, could be found in favour of the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to the tenant. 2)The tenants had entered a written tenancy agreement. The Hearing Officer did not err in law in finding that neither the landlord nor tenant had joint authority to enter the agreement.  3)The tenancy agreement was valid. There was no breach of trust by the landlord as the tenant did not purport to act for his mother or for his benefit. 4)The hearing officer made no error in law.  5)Section 70 of The residential Tenancies Act provides for an order respecting any tenancy agreement, rental units and other residential property. Section 8 of the Act applies. Section 7 provides for possession by lease and for written tenancy agreements. Sections 8 and 9 provide for the determination of periodic tenancies. 6)Section 8 provides for a hearing officer to inquire into the tenants’ rights. 7)Section 7 of the Code of Conduct provides for disclosure to persons who wish to obtain possession of a rental unit pursuant to s.2(f)(i) or pursuant to section 33(g) of the tenancy agreement unless otherwise noted. 8)Section 9 of the LEA (Lease of Ownership) Act provides that a person who signs a tenancy agreement must be estopped from denying the fact of the third person's agency under the general law of estoppel, and it is immaterial whether that person was acting for himself or for the landlord in finding she had no jurisdiction. 9)The Hearing Officer adopted the common law definition of landlord and adopted the formula of landlord"

Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.

No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started was accepted. Due to extreme winter weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line. During this static discharge, pin holes would be created and gasoline would leak out. The vapours would then be drawn to the pilot light in the furnace where ignition would occur and then flash back to the area underneath the truck where the gasoline was pooled. 2)The subsequent recall notice deleted any reference to off-road driving. 3)The plaintiff's evidence as to where the fire originated was not accepted. 4)The court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and their expert evidence in preference to the defendant.

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997.

The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The claims against the solicitor are without a factual basis. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including probative evidence, which was supported by candid admissions at trial. HELD: The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors were dismissed. 1)The contract was a valid transaction. The terms of the contract were favourable to the purchasers and the contract was advantageous to the appellant. 2)The timing of the meeting was absolutely necessary to satisfy the appellant who was fully aware of the transaction and who was prepared to perform the transaction for the benefit of her daughter. 3)There was no evidence of undue influence or influence by the appellant in the meeting with the solicitor. It was clear from the outset that the appellant was motivated to acquire the land for his own purposes and not just to help out the plaintiff by taking it off her hands and thus relieving her of the burden of owning it. It is understandable that at the time of the agreement neither therese Nadeau nor the solicitor gave much consideration to the value of the residence and yardsite. The parties then lived with the contract for at least two years. 4)The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff, when she entered the contract, had full capacity. He saw no reason on the evidence to doubt her competence and that is fully supported by her testimony at the trial when she was in her late 80's. 5)The evidence strongly supported his conclusions that the meeting between the appellant and the solicitor was necessary to conclude that the contract is a valid contract. The issues were factual and the sole matter of significance before us was whether the standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) had been met."

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The respondent repainted the buildings haphazard and multi-coloured. They were an eye-sore. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error in law. The meaning of 'unsightly' in subsection 363(3) must be ascertained by reference to the words associated with it 'a state of disrepair or the accumulation of physical debris' and 2)Any proposed amendment must be drafted in a way that does not invoke s.24 of the Charter.  3)The court found that when the legislators turned their minds to the unsightliness of buildings, they drafted subsection 6. Unsightly in that subsection cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings because this category is already dealt with in s.6.

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argues that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on errors of fact and not on proper interpretation of evidence. 3) There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The trial judge attempted to portray himself as someone who was good to the children but failed to give proper effect to it. The evidence that the appellant asked not to be left alone with the children was not evidence of the truth of the allegations. The inference drawn by this evidence was material and played an essential part in the decision to convict.  4) In the circumstances of this case, either use reveals a chain of reasoning which is not available to the judge in law or in logic on this record and the court concludes that the errors were not sufficient to justify the denial of evidence on this point."

Dismissing the action, that (1) the defendant did not have cause to dismiss the plaintiff; (2) the clause in the agreement was not specifically drawn to the plaintiff's attention and (3) it was unnecessary for him to take the action to lawyer as he did not perceive it as way to fire him; (4) the plaintiff was awarded damages for breach of contract and (5) the 30 day notice provision was not applicable to this action because the plaintiff had not obtained a copy of the agreement from the defendant and had not seen it prior to its signing; and (6) there was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the Director of the Enforcement Division, had discussed the possibility of terminating the employment without notice."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay monthly spousals of $5,000 and $741 per month for the support of their two children. The interspousal contract provided that support would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner sought to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: 1)The agreement was not applicable to the petitioner. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. 3)The court observed that it is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim support. In this case, the petitioner is entitled to child support in the amount of 40% of the net income. 4)The parties had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting issues, child support, and the division of family property. It was the respondent's responsibility to provide support for the petitioner in the event of a material change in circumstances. 5)The respondent was ordered to pay $65,000 per annum in child support. The amount payable by way of equal monthly payments was reduced to $40,000 by the agreement. The respondent had no resources to pay back any interim support received.  6)It was not appropriate in the circumstances for the court to make such an order. In light of the petitioner's income and circumstances, it was not reasonable to extrapolate from the contract to the amount actually earned. There were no circumstances in which it was appropriate to vary an agreement that the parties had relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis. The fairness and equity of the interim order may be questioned."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1)A sentence of fine or custodial sentence was imposed and she was to complete three weeks of treatment. 2)The Court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused would not drink and drive again and that her conduct over the last 18 months had shown that her offence was the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew. 3)Criminal record, however, did not preclude the granting of curative release. The accused had demonstrated good sobriety and was motivated to take steps to reduce her alcohol consumption and to participate in personal counselling including psychological or psychiatric treatment as directed by the Probation Officer. 4)Although it can never be said with certainty that a drunk driver will not drive again, the accused's conduct over 18 months suggests that it is probable she will not. She has been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010 and is currently through the program for drinking drivers. 5)The accused has two prior convictions for drinking and driving. After her first conviction in 2006, she was convicted of driving while over the legal limit and returned to Saskatchewan to be near her family. She remained sober for only a few months before being arrested for drinking again. She was prohibited from driving on any street, road, highway or other public place anywhere in Canada for two years commencing today."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who is now independent of the parties. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and they were divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the parties exchanged financial disclosure and provided the court with their affidavits and financial statements and both counsel were given the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant. The applicant argued that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that the respondent had failed to take advantage of that debt. Application allowed; the respondent's obligation to provide $175,000 per month was reduced to $5,500 per month after the expiry of the support order; there was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. Both parties were preparing their own agreement in satisfaction of all claims for support, interim support, possession of or title to property or any other claim arising out of the marriage and in assessing whether there has been substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The Agreement was sound when it was signed and there have been no material changes in the circumstances of either party. However, the respondent appeared to have taken advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant as contemplated by Miglin (supra)."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, being in breach of s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to section 4(1) of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark, contrary to s. 553 of the Code. He contended his right to a fair trial had been infringed. Dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings, that the accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his rights to be tried within a reasonable time. As a result of the factors set out in the Charter application, the accused's s. 11(b) rights as guaranteed by s. 7 of the Charter were breached. The reasons for the delay, including the inherent time requirements of the case, such as the time involved in processing the charges, retaining counsel, pre-trial procedures (bail applications, change of venue applications, and adjournments), actions of the Crown, and the Crown in the face of a charge of breaching condition of recognizance, among others, were found to be adverse to the interests of the accused."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was challenged on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused. 3)The accused had previously informed his lawyer of the court date. 4)The s7(3) of the Criminal Code provides that the common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences. 5)The law is a general term. It normally includes all of the defences thecommon law considers sufficient for a person from criminal liability. It can also include excuses specific to particular offences. If Parliament does not give some indication that it has assigned a particular meaning to the word 'excuse', the word will be taken to have the meaning of 'law', as used in R. v. Holmes (1988), 41 C.C.C.(3d) 497. 6)The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had an 'excruciatingly long' absence from court. To abandon the argument for an excuse that was supported by the fact that the original offence was stayed by the Crown was a wrong decision."

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21, 1997 and with reference to the Contract between the defendant and the city of Regina.  1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. 2)The single issue of privity was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached.  3)If the plaintiffs had intended to present the case the contract was the whole arrangement between the city, the Association, the contractor and the truckers, they would have had to draw in all the parties, including the trucking association and city council as well as all the related documents. 4)The evidence did not clearly indicate that the defendants intended that all contracts and arrangements be taken as one overall agreement and enforced accordingly. The evidence was in conflict but the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation.  5)Costs were awarded to the plaintiffs for the breach of the contract. 6)Each case was dismissed with findings as to damages."

Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT.

HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The documents sought were not privileged and must be produced. 2)The requested documents related to the history of the plaintiff corporation and its dealings with the operators of the franchises. 3)The letter was not privileged because it contained threat and the words'shortfalls and deficiencies' did not add much more. 4)The plaintiffs were not prepared to reply to the letter. 5)The affidavits, tapes, and licensee agreement were all privileged. 6)The request for particulars was so broad and general that it would require the defendants to literally produce every piece of paper in their possession. Much of that would be irrelevant. 7)All agreements between the defendants as they relate to the franchises in Canada and Saskatchewan were privileged and therefore inadmissible. 8)The letters and memoranda relating to leasehold improvements and fixtures were privileged. 9)Any correspondence between the plaintiffs and prospective purchasers of the Robin's Donuts was admissible evidence. 10)The plaintiff was not prepared in anticipation of litigation.  11)Each party was entitled to a share in the costs of the application. 12)The claim for damages arising from an alleged defamation of the defendants was not supported by the affidavit. 13)The application for the production of the documents was dismissed."
c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFWC) which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving the applicant. In the other motion the union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all the material filed in support of the application. In both applications, the union sought to have the Board strike and remove virtually all of the materials filed. The applicant argued that the Board interfered with its operation by requiring members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. HELD: The relief sought by the Union was granted. The application was dismissed. 1) There is no necessity for their admission. The respondent must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. 2) The affidavits filed by the union are admissible. They are attached to an affidavit of one of its members who attests that he prepared the transcript of the radio broadcast. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript. 3) The admissibility of the two affidavits by the applicant and the union is not supported by admissible evidence. It is impossible to conclude bias exists within the labour Relations board or that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against it. 4) The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon contain only three paragraphs but are four pages in length. The reader will best understand the affidavit if it is quoted in full.  5) The affidavit of a former vice-chairperson of the SEDB confirms the existence of these documents. They were admissible by reason of s. 7 of The Saskatchewan Evidence Act, S.S., c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the legislature, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Saskatchewan Legislature shall be deemed to be deemed as authentic and thus admissible as well.  6) The portions of an article from the Regina Leader-Post and a copy of the Labour Reporter newsletter were not admissible to prove the accuracy and truth of what was said. 7) The"
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse/dependence disorder. He has been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 3) As the appellant has grown up and started residing in foster care, it is pertinent to note that he has consistently run away from the protected environments sought for him and has begun to abuse alcohol and drugs. 4) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. In this case, the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. The personal interests are paramount. 5) The Court adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining fitness. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that although the appellant can communicate with his lawyer and assist counsel in his/her defence, the accused must be able to interpret the nature of the proceedings and to appreciate his own best interest. The failure to provide a plea authorized by s. 16 restricts the accused's ability to make rational decisions beneficial to himself. 6) In asking the court to require that the accused be capable of making rational decisions in the exercise of his or her right, the court is asking this court to adopt a higher threshold threshold for fitness. The test has clearly been rejected by the courts. 7) Applying the test in R. v. Gorecki (1976), 32 C.C.C.(2d) 129 (Ont. C.A.) and Lamer C.J.C., for the majority, reached the same conclusion as the Alberta Court of Appeal. 8) The trial judge adopted the interpretation of that test in Taylor. 9) It was agreed that the test to be applied"

The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. HELD: 1)The matter had been heard in January 2002 and was reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs. 2)Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs. 3)Given the representation of the counsel as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over the conduct of their counsel or against the counsel directly at this time.

Defence now wants further disclosure of information for the purpose of preparing for and pursuing an inquiry into the facts that relate to those important issues. HELD: 1) The Crown shall make timely disclosure of (a) the number of stops of out-of-province vehicles made by Constable Chornecki in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and will need to be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold. 2) In a motion of this kind, the Court ought to guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions'—speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, however, the defence has already stated that issues regarding s.8 and s9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the 'Charter') will be raise at trial and the Crown has indicated it will make further disclosure in the coming days. 3) Defence now seeks additional disclosure of the information and extensive authorities. [4] To pursue the fishing analogy so often used in the authorities, the purposeof such an inquiry will in part be to determine whether, in comparison with the guarantees given by the Charter, the investigation in this case 'cast too wide a net'."

The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in his charge. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.  1) The trial judge was of the opinion that counsel for the defence had done most adequately and that it was neither necessary nor desirable that he should repeat the outline of those discrepancies. The evidence of the Crown was that the appellant's cross-examination of the complainant would not have served any useful purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from their efficient discharge of their sworn duty. 2) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The charge was found to be consistent with R. v. Jacquard.  3) The appellant's point of view was that if the sentence of two years or more was imposed, the appellant would have had no appeal against the order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. 4) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. While there is a general obligation on the court to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence, this case met that standard. If a sentence of 2 years less a day is imposed, Mr. Almajidi will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused pleaded guilty to a charge of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute. In addition, the Crown applied for s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the ages of 16 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. HELD: The sentence was increased to 10 years.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life. Failure of the justice system and the courts to protect young people by imposing jail sentences that will serve to denounce and deter abusive behaviour towards children will only perpetuate the kind of abuse and consequences that S., the accused in this case, has himself experienced and from which he still suffers. 2) There can be no question by virtue of the recent amendments to the Code that the Parliament of Canada has clearly sought to protect the children and young people of this country from the abuse of adults. It has done so by enacting the provisions of s. 718.01 mandating a mandatory prohibition order from possessing firearms, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance during the course of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order. A further order shall issue pursuant to ss. 487.051(2) authorizing and ordering you to provide sufficient samples of your bodily substances so that a DNA analysis may be conducted. The length of the sentence requested by the Crown will be years less one day."

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that the parties are absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest.

The respondents Cameco and UEM preferred the Kensington plan and were prepared to commit themselves to it. They took the position that they had exercised their right to vote by entering into the voting agreement, rather than having sold their vote by so doing. Allowing the appeal, that the word in parenthesis rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the Joint venture, and that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause.

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT: The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act setting aside the plaintiff's pre-judgment garnishee in which $2,291.90 was paid into Court from the defendant's bank account at Biggar and District Credit Union on December 7, 2005. The issue is whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2).

5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a variation of the Corollary Relief Judgment in which he alleged that the mother had refused to provide access and communication with his four children. The father had been denied access with his children for multiple sclerosis. He sought to have the restrictions on his use of marijuana continue in effect and receive a cost award. The mother opposed the application and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November. HELD: Application dismissed. The court found that the evidence did not support the father's contention that his marijuana use was a risk to his children. It was also found that his evidence of the children's concerns about his medical condition and its possible effect on his driving was not supported by his children's information. Therefore, the court ordered the reinstatement of the access provisions. The evidence showed that the father took into account and accepted responsibility for some of the circumstances leading to the failure of his children to visit his father. Although the father had indicated that he would not allow the children to use marijuana in the presence of his mother, it was assumed that his use was benign and without potential risk for his children as the marijuana use had not been found to be a significant issue."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT.

The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor.

The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","HELD: The action was dismissed. It was not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon Securities did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at Sturgis Meats. The monitoring was done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business. There was not in the view proof to that standard that the reason the defendant breached the contract by failing to monitor the temperature in the freezer at this business was within their control. Based on the original contract between the parties (Exhibit P-1), and ongoing payments being made in 2010 by the business, the court was satisfied that the contract between them was solely for the monitoring of the temperatures in the cooler and freezer and did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at that business. HELD: 1)It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that could have resulted in no freezer alarm being received by them so it could be reported to the plaintiff. It is equally possible that a hacker or someone at another company could have set the alarm at the plaintiff's computer system. 2)Either way, there was insufficient evidence to prove that the breach of the contract was within the defendant's control. 3)The plaintiff was not able to establish on a balance of probabilities that Gardon had not received a freezer temperature alarm that it could have produced. The plaintiff's claim for $9,000,000 in damages against the defendant and $5,000 against the insurance company, could not be proven. 4)There was no evidence that any of the employees monitoring the signal from the plaintiff to the defendant from another business or attending at another business were paid out of the sum of $8,000."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine and is looking to retire in the next few years. HELD: 1) The respondent will have few lean years until he has paid off the arrearns. He did not have the ability to pay them willingly it had to be snatched away from him.  2) The petitioner has struggled for 25 years to get the respondent to pay child support. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 a month because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity. Now, some 12 years later, he is in the black. It is commonplace for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The respondent's child support obligation under the 2001 order continued even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. It appears that he is trying to reduce his child support obligations. 3) There is no undue hardship to either party. The petitioner had always been a child of the marriage. The 2001 order imputed her income $109,912 and the s. Guideline amount of $55,620 was reduced to $1,687 in 2001 when his income was imputed to be $111,940. 4) It is immaterial at this stage that the respondent has not paid child support in excess of $30,000 in the past 25 years. The burden of proof is on him to establish on a balance of probabilities that he cannot now pay and will not in the future be able to pay the child support that he owes. The Court cannot attribute to him the amount of child support owed by the petitioner with respect to his actual income over the years. It would be unfair to him to deprive the petitioner of that privilege."

The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death, contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant contended that his evidence was totally irrelevant to the charges and worse, that the evidence given by the Crown was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant's credibility.

He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay and you can ask him questions.”  3)There was no evidence that the appellant, who was not counsel at trial, or even initially on the appeal, wished an opportunity to specifically address the appellant’s argument that the verdict was unreasonable.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes. He denied involvement.

Defence counsel objected on this basis, arguing that the Crown had ambushed him and his client and that they should not be permitted to call this witness. The Crown counsel argued that the defence had not disclosed their intention to use the witness, and that the witness's name was mentioned in the disclosure given to defence. HELD: 1)A stay of proceedings was out of the question. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by not being told that Ace Carlos Whitecap would be a Crown witness. 2)The only remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call the witness. Stay of proceedings is ruled out. The court must take into account all aspects of the failure to make full disclosure, including the nature of the charge, delay, adjournments to date and at who's request, the amount of time that it may take the accused to consider the evidence and the Crown's case before election or plea. 3)The delay in proceedings will impact on the relief factor. If at the beginning of trial, an adjournment is ordered, that lawyer should have sat through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness and that lawyer might have had to take over the case entirely to be sure to protect the interests of both the accused and the defence.

The point in time at which the accused has a sufficient time to consider, consider and decide whether to enter a plea or an election or a plea.

As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","FIAT: The defendant plaintiffs sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of The Class Actions Act. A number of grounds of appeal advanced, including that the CPA cause of action was not determined until after the appeal was finally determined. A conference call was convened to discuss the next steps. Counsel for the plaintiffs was given the opportunity to speak to the issue of whether it was appropriate to move the matter forward at this time given that there was an appeal pending on only one aspect of the certifying order. A stay was granted pending the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiffs sought to proceed concurrently with the appeal on all of the remaining issues of certification. They argued that the stay should be lifted because the matter is pending before the court of appeal. They also sought to have the stay lifted on the entire certification order. HELD: 1)The certification order was stayed and the entire matter may be appealed inter alia. Where there is an application to lift the stay, the entire process of certifying the certificate is stayed. Where an application is granted under the Rules of Court and the reasons for the stay are still unclear, the Court may order further proceedings in the meantime.  2)The plaintiffs sought a stay in the certification process pending their appeal of the decision of the Supreme Court on whether the certification order should stay the entire proceeding.  3)The entire certification process was stayed, except for one aspect, because the Court had already granted leave to the plaintiffs to appeal on that portion of the order. Where the Court has already granted the stay in this case, the portion that was granted to the defendants relating to the breach of duty of care causes of action has been stayed pending this appeal."

The respondent’s solicitors filed the certificate of pending litigation after his death. The appellant transferred the land subject to the certificate of pending litigation into her name only and entered into an agreement to sell the land, which could not proceed with the certificate of pending litigation. HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

The chambers judge made the decision pursuant to s.47 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, s.98, c Q-1.01, which caused the certificate to be vacated. The proposed appeal would involve revisiting an interlocutory order that preserves the status quo pending final decision after trial.

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant.

The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties invited some guests to the apartment for a sociable and convivial evening together. The accused invited the complainant to join them in the basement to participate in the fight club. They stumbled into a glass window breaking it and ultimately fell to the floor with the complainant sustaining a nasal fracture. The police arrested and charged the accused with assault causing bodily harm. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)On the evidence, the court found that the accused cannot rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence. There are too many variables and probabilities. 2)The accused would have had to commence the assault without justification and without the intention to cause grievous bodily harm and he must have used no more force than in the circumstances was necessary to protect himself. 3)The evidence did not support a casual relationship between the blows of the accused, on my findings of fact, and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. 4)The court concluded that the encounter was one continuing episodic event and the accused had not provoked the complainant by his conduct. 5)There was no evidence to support the idea that without justification the accused provoked the assault upon himself. The doctor's opinion was that it was occasioned by blunt trauma and the blunt trauma would have been consistent with a causative factor. 6)The Court concluded that a consensual fight was not appropriate."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of the victim contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker contrary to ss. 137 and 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under section 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence pursuant to R. v. D.C.V. (2005) SCC 78. The accused will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. In these circumstances, the young person did not oppose the Crown's application. HELD: A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A credit for 6 months for pre-sentence detention was granted. An additional period of 18 months, 12 months of which will be served in closed custody followed by 6 months of community supervision was ordered. The young person was prohibited from possessing firearms, having completed his Grade education and appearing before the Youth Justice Court whenever required to do so; having regard to the principles of rehabilitation and reintegration, the sentence would allow the time frame required for the youth to stabilize and engage with support services prior to his release in the community. A sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation and a 6 month weapons prohibition was ordered, together with an order for a DNA sample to be included in the DNA Data Bank.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous grounds of appeal. 1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) Each of the issues raised in this case was dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies here."
1994canlii5095.txt,"The Director of Labour Standards issued a certificate against the City of Regina certifying that it owed a transit employee $318.41 in wages for hours worked in weeks containing a statutory holiday in excess of 32 hours as provided in the Labour Standards Act. The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act declaring that the City owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. The Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At the hearing, the Director filed another letter, reducing the assessor's salary to reflect the existence of a public holiday. At issue was whether the City was obliged to pay the employee overtime for hours worked over 32 in a week which had a holiday in it and if so, if so. HELD: The City's application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due orowing to the transit employee. There would be no order as to costs. 1)The legislature intended the rate-of-pay provision in any agreement to be read and evaluated in the light of the other provisions of the agreement before comparison was made with its counterpart in the Act. 2)The legislation intended it should be left open to demonstrate that a provision (in an agreement) on its face less favourable than its counterpart is more favourable than the latter is evident not only from the wording of the section but from the decision itself to include the second branch of S62(1) in the section."
6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the warrant: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of each accused issued in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the Electronic Surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set Aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. The granting of leave to cross-examine is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence on the Charter hearing. It would appear that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of a free cross-examination should be the preserve of the trial judge. Why should legitimate discovery be delayed? Why should provincial court judge not be permitted to apply very simple test to assure against prolixity, irrelevance, and well-known policy concerns? Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the court judge. In this respect, R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106, is a strong directive to that end. This should not be considered as a usurpation of a trial judge's function. Where leave is granted at the preliminary inquiry stage to conduct cross- examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization as it was in this case, it is not obvious why such evidence should not been admissible on an application at trial to set off the authorization, bearing in mind the Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the Preliminary inquiry such as the application that would require a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants."

There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The constitutional question is not properly before me. 2)The three bylaws tendered by the appellans did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial as the zoning bylaw did not. The bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock. The amendments to the bylaw addressing the meaning of the word 'hamlet' did not refer to any issue in the trial. 3)The uncertainty on the issue of whether the amendment would have been adduced at trial did not exist. 4)Even if the question were properly before the court, the application would dismiss. 5)All of the evidence that had come into the possession of these appellants after the trial was found to be relevant, including the minutes of council meetings, documents relating to the basic planning statement and zoning bylaws, and the rule prohibiting cattle in the district, all had some relevance to the issues. 6)The bylaw's relevance was not lost on due diligence."

In November 1999, the Court issued an order that it would take jurisdiction and hear the application under S. 18 of the Family Maintenance Act. The problem had been with translation services and obtaining a transcript. The mother had been very angry at the father and had taken him outside, placed him on the ground and punched him until friends intervened. This took some time to arrange and complete and during this period the child had remained in Nova Scotia. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his mother to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody.  1)There was no unreasonable period of time from the date of the application to the decision of the Court. The father could provide the financial and environmental factors more satisfactorily while the mother had the cultural aspects such as an Inuit extended family and physical environment to enhance this and the Inuktitut language. 2)The father was to pay the costs of the translation service which were part of the reasons for the decision to grant custody to the applicant. 3)The applicant had reason to send the child to Nova Scotia, in addition to wanting him to know his father. The weight to be attached was to be determined in the context of answering the question with whom would the best interests and welfare of this child be most likely achieved. It may be without any court application she may have had to agree to extend the parties original agreement beyond the agreed year. The Court has great sympathy for the Respondent mother and the situation she found herself in. She was concerned about her son's welfare and sent him to her home.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. The plaintiffs applied to dismiss the proceeding on the basis of three factors: 1) an inordinate delay; 2) an inexcusable delay; 3) the defendants acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. The Court dismissed the application in part because of the delay caused by the defendants' failure to file their list of documents and their acquiescence to the slow pace of litigation; and 4) because the plaintiffs had not brought any action for want of prosecution. Allowing the application and ordering the dismissal of the proceeding, that the Court found that the defendants had failed to take steps to remedy the delay and that the plaintiffs were likely to be prejudiced by the delay."

He sought a declaration that a member of the police service must be informed of any investigation of his conduct prior to the commencement of the investigation as required by s.54 of the Police Act.; the Act does not permit the amendment in Form A discipline notice since it is a statutory form. The relief sought regarding disclosure had been abandoned by the applicant. The applicant argued that the fundamental questions to be addressed revolved around issues of statutory interpretation that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the alternative remedies were not adequate. The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member. HELD: The application was dismissed. There is an adequate alternative remedy which should be pursued. There were no 'special circumstances' upon which the court should exercise its discretion to determine the merits of the application.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of prohibition to prevent the respondent hearing officer, in his capacity as Hearing Officer under The Police Act, from proceeding with the hearing into the conduct of the applicant pursuant to discipline charges brought against him by the respondent police chief.

The issues were the procedure on the appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and manner in which they were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 4) In the absence of any evidence that the applicant's right to a fair hearing was affected, the hearing could proceed."

She had completed her studies to become a teacher 13 years ago and had erroneously been advised that a consumer proposal would discharge these loans. Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties. The bankrupt had acted in good faith and had been unable to service the loans in the early years when she did not have permanent employment. Compromising the debt and requiring her to only pay half of it was not an available option.","The Bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of about $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. She had applied for interest relief in the amount of $565.00. Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Relief was granted. The Bankrupt had 13 years of student loans outstanding. The proposal was made because she was advised by a debt counsellor that it would be an effective way of satisfying her student loans. After completing the proposal, she learned that this advice was not correct. She was forced to pay a significant portion of the debt, say half of it, which would be a continuation of financial difficulty that prevented her from paying the loans.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto. This motion, under ss.7, 11(d) and 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is for an order that the accused be provided with full disclosure in useable format. The issue is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. HELD: 1) There is no need for the Crown to provide hard copies of any documents created on paper and scanned into the computer unless the document 'has been, or will be, utilized by the police or the Crown in hard copy' (R. v. Laporte). 2) In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been providing in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of an accused to make full answer/defence. This appears to be a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. 3) The use of hard copies for trial preparation that is sought by the defence is reasonable. The Crown has stated that it will continue following such a process. 4) The notebooks of those officers who were involved in gathering information involved in the issuance of the search warrants and those not testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in a hard copy in such a fashion as to support the disclosure provided in usable format. 5) The notebook format is appropriate as it allows for cross-referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed in the affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence through the electronic disclosure.  6) The Crown is entitled to hard copy of all documents filed by it. 7) It is appropriate that the issue be dealt with by 'Laporte inventory' (the inventory) in a fashion that will allow the defence an opportunity to review some of the source documents in relation to the search warrant and to determine if any objection to them would be removed. If the answer is yes, what is the appropriate order to make on the materials filed?  7) The issue that has arisen in other cases has been whether the method of disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. It appears that the preferred format is the notebook format provided"

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. The accused pled guilty to assaulting a peace officer with a weapon. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by ss. 753.1. The offender had 67 prior convictions, four of them for violence. The offences were violent, one of which involved stabbing the officer in the face. The officer fired his taser at the accused, who was trying to break free of the wires and the police officer was forced to back away. At paragraph 41 of the pre-sentence statement, the court found that the accused was approximately eight feet away when he was cornered by the police and the officer, and there was no attempt to try and strike either officer. It would appear that this offence is a'serious personal injury offense' as defined in s.752 as well as a long-term offence, and the accused's conduct endangered or was likely to endanger the life or safety of the officer. The Court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions, a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the offender's record and the number of convictions."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor for the police to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. This additional informational requirement on police ensures that detainee who persists in wanting to waive the right to counsel will know what it is that he is actually giving up. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper but the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s s. 8 Charter rights by failing to explicitly warn the police of the obligation to provide unequivocal advice to the accused once he has changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 2) The respondent had not explicitly indicated that he would like to contact a lawyer. The Crown did not raise this issue with the learned judge. 3) On the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction to hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee until a reasonable opportunity has been had, the Crown was required to explicitly state that it had not obtained a waiver of the right on the evidence. In this case, the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver once the police officer determined he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. 4) The holding-off requirement was not required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst. Lerat. In such circumstances, the burden of establishing a waiver is on the Crown."
d_2011skpc108.txt,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court did not know who to believe and he was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. Although the accused had apologized to the complainant and apologized to his mother, there was nothing from any of the witnesses who testified that undermines credibility. The complainant had initiated the physical aggression by hitting the accused on the shoulder in frustration at how matters had unfolded to which he reacted with a blow. None of that scenario supported the Crown being able to prove the complainant had not consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred. The accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the bank's security interest upon the ground that she was at all times the person named in the registration certificate pertaining to the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The Court held that ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner access to the family home and supervised access only for the respondent father. The Court held that the evidence suggested that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were unreliable and that there was a risk of harm. Therefore, the Court applied the Risk of Harm test, holding that the allegations were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and that the harm test was not accepted. The court found that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. HELD: 1)The Court found that it was impossible to conclude from the evidence that there is anything to be taken from the incident that showed any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence did not support the respondent's contention that he was the only person to put the children to bed. 2)The respondent was found to have been significantly involved in his children's lives beyond the level of most fathers who have normal work commitments. 3)Discretion was not appropriate. 4)The petitioner had provided factual evidence as background. Much of it is expressly disputed by the respondent or implicitly acknowledged by him. However, the onus is on parents who seek to restrict maximum contact to satisfy the court there is good reason to restrict contact. If the evidence is such that a proper assessment of the risk going forward can be made, the Chambers judge should do so."

The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain.

There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT.

Since then, the petitioner has reduced the amount of support to 1,500 per month and even those that have been irregular and not on time have been paid on time. HELD: 1)The application was premature.

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","Applicants, Peter Boone and Loren Bough, seek to convert some $2.5 million of debentures issued by the respondent to Medusa Medical Technologies Inc. (MEDusa) into an action. Boone and Bough are taking steps to attempt to secure payment of their debenteures by means of an application to this Court. The intent being that once that occurs, the separate action for damages commenced by Medusa will be consolidated into one action with the respondent as defendant and plaintiff by counterclaim. Bough vigorously opposes the motion to convert as it is not satisfied that the initial application can be heard in months rather than years. The moving party, Medusa, has failed to meet its burden of proving such a proposition on a balance of probabilities. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) Rule 6.03(4) provides a presumption in favour of an action if, as in this case, certain procedural issues can be met (e.g., the occurrence of default, the possible liability of the plaintiff, the appointment of a receiver) are met. 2) There can be no question that an action as intended by the defendant will significantly increase the time it will take to bring an action to trial and the erosion will be significantly lessened if the dispute is resolved by application. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application.  3) The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by the parties and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties. The Court found that the application could proceed as an application but that the hearing could proceed primarily by way of affidavit evidence and cross examination and possibly limited direct testimony."

This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the claim of the plaintiffs. In February 2012, counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial. At that time, Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, advised the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. That was later confirmed when a certificate of dissolution was filed with the Court. HELD: 1) The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. The Court ordered that Orion Morgan should be produced for the purpose of cross- examination.  2) The Court was aware that there is case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. It was not prepared to follow those decisions but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 3) The court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by the plaintiffs that the Court accept Ms. Fehr's affidavit. She should make herself available for cross-examination if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file her affidavit in support of its case. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1999. It was then that the plaintiff discovered that cracks were appearing in the attic of the house. She sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the home. She alleged that Mui and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting facts and breached their fiduciary duty expected of them. She also claimed aggravated damages against the defendants and punitive damages against them for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. HELD: 1) The inspection of the property by the Rural Municipality of Corman Park was only granted in June 1999. There was no discussion about home inspection or extending the deadline to remove the conditions so that further investigations could be carried out. The search for a suitable home then expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs. 2) The first time the plaintiff visited the property she was surprised to find that there were cracks in the eaves. She assumed that the problem was caused by the defendant Mui's work. She was wrong. The realtor's work was done in good faith and without any problems. The PCDS was a patent invention and the law of caveat emptor applies. The fact that the PCDS did not exist at the time of the inspection did not affect the plaintiff's determination of whether or not the home had been moved and whether any defects existed in it.  3) The plaintiff was wrong in assuming that all necessary repairs and maintenance would be performed by the defendants. The defendants were not performing their duties as realtors. 4) The court found that the defendants were liable to the plaintiff in damages both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation.STC awarded damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two, rather than five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and that it was mere fledging."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found the warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and observations were not sufficiently strong or probative to confirm the existence of the marihuana grow operation and to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. Therefore, the trial judge substituted his view of the law with that of the issuing judge."
d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess to assess whether any injuries sustained were not minor injuries.

Application allowed; costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke were directed to be paid in the cause of the action. Although there had been some circumstantial evidence before the court, no 'air of reality' could be found to the defence. There was also the issue of liability with respect to the injuries, especially in light of the fact that the defendant had not obtained a general liability judgment in 1989.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marihuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts.

The Crown alleged that Brooks consented to the Crown's submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeited property. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) Section 20(4) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from forfeiture. 2) There is no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the testimony of the police officer who testified that Brooks 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence'. 3) The test for determining whether a sentence is disproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter and would result in the denial of relief. 4) The court must first consider the gravity of an offence, the personal characteristics of the offender, the standard of care available to the general public and the law in general. 5) The applicant must satisfy the judge hearing the application that she is innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable custody to be sure the property did not fall within the definition of 'offence-related property'. 6) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident.

It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order. 2) The father did not have an ongoing obligation to provide support. The child's future ability to 'withdraw from parental charge' was unknown. 3) There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the respondent be paid all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. Allowing the application on all fours, that the applicant's contention that this creates the degree of governmental control to warrant the application was untenable. In cases involving arrests, detentions, searches and the like, to apply the Charter to purely private action would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result."

They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.

The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. Sadly, the petitioner, Megan Wolfe, died of cancer in January 2015. The third party takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’�s Law Act, 1997. The designation does not bind the court when considering whether or not to grant person of adequate interest status to the grandmother after having heard all of the evidence at trial. It is generally applicable to screen out applicants who do not have both a significant relationship with the child and a demonstrated and ongoing commitment to the child. 2) The grandmother was to represent herself at trial and the Court would have considered whether the grandmother could have obtained an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. 3) The father represented himself.

SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for September 24, 1998 and the date of the plaintiff returning to his pre-accident employment.  1)Sawkiw's benefits were terminated October 23/98 pursuant to ss.185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. 2)The plaintiff was found to have a relapse under s. 142(1)(a) of The Personal Injury Protection Benefits Regulations as he was unable to perform certain farm duties and was required by SGI to attend physiotherapy sessions. 3)It was not clear how SGI expected the plaintiff to spend his time and energy in treatment and if he was entitled to interest on such an amount from the date such benefits should have been paid until the commencement date of his employment in Alberta.  4)SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. The court found that SGI had prior knowledge the plaintiff was suffering from depression and it was not entitled to terminate the benefits. 5)Saskatchewan Government Insurance was awarded costs of preparing and filing notice of motion."

The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he did not own a computer, had never owned one, and did not intend to again access the internet. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the additional orders made under s. 487.051 of the Code. 1) The defendant did not have a criminal record. He had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in a Latin course. He used the university computers to engage in the activity. The societal harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, who are sexually and physically abused and bear all of the consequences of satisfying some adult's sexual desires or fantasies. 2) There were no mitigating factors referred to in the pre-sentence report. A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentenceon the facts in this matter, although the defendant qualifies for the same to the extent that he would not endanger the community if one were imposed. He is serving the social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in an action for breach of a trust agreement. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. The judge had refused, on the grounds that the claims were frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of the court's process. The plaintiff sought Supplementary Interim Ruling, which set out how the court would proceed with the claims. The supplementary decision concerned whether the defendant should issue summons pursuant to s. 7(1) of The Small Claims Act, or alternatively by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs, and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in the Court of Queen's Bench, must be done in the manner described in the supplementary decision."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of child support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The amount of $2,292.58 which is 33% of the respondent's income is $630. The children were adequately provided for on the basis of his disability. The Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a monthly payment of $442.00. Any payment order would not jeopardize the welfare of the children. The claim for relief was grounded in the fact that the respondent was the registered owner of the farm land and he should receive half of the value of the land. The other half should be paid to the petitioner by monthly payments of $500. The Court awarded the balance of $6,000.00 to the respondent and $500 to the wife. The balance should go to the husband to meet his obligations which presently form part of his monthly expenses as set out in his financial statement. The husband's pension income was $3,086 which results in a shortfall of $1,111.67 if he is required to pay out an additional $500 month. The wife's expenses were inflated. There was a monthly expense of $290 for dental and eye care. No explanation was given for this. The monthly expense for legal fees was $75 for the other. Finally, small economics could be achieved. The court had no hesitation in concluding that the wife had the means."

The testator died in January 2015 and application for probate had not yet been made. The deceased’s will had bequeathed all her property to her husband, Michael Reiter, who died in October 2015. The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries. As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence. She was instructed to serve the material on the respondents, the alternate executor and the beneficiaries.","The applicant applied for an order that the respondents renounce their right to probate the last will and testament of the deceased or, in the alternative, that they be terminated as executors of the estate.

The respondents are ordered to serve and file on the applicant and on Michael Reiter by Wednesday, January 27, 2016, a list of the assets to date. In order to determine the issues, it is necessary for the court to be provided with information as to the status of the administration of the current assets.  1) The applicant has failed to serve all those persons who are interested in the application which include the alternate executor under the will and all the named beneficiaries. 2) The respondents have failed to provide any evidence to the court as to whether the evidence filed on QB 33 of 2015 is evidence before the court. If the applicant wishes to consider the evidence, he will need the consent of the respondents for the Court to consider that evidence or will need to file further evidence in affidavit form putting forward such evidence as is relevant on this application.  3) There is little evidence before me as to why the respondents should be removed as executor of the Anne Reiter estate. There was no evidence filed at the time of death as to what the assets were at the date of death or are presently. 4) There was insufficient evidence filed by the respondents as to their role in the estate following the death of the Testator. 5) The respondent's failure to supply any evidence respecting the status or assets of their estate was grounds for adjourned application.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the child.  2) The respondent demonstrated that he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the relationship with the petitioner. The relationship spanned the years 2000 to 2007, commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over the years the petitioner provided care for the petitioner, participated in activities with her and was involved in her two young children who were conceived while she was separated from the respondent. 3) It is pertinent to note that the respondent's record as a person with a sufficient interest speaks for itself. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment to be served in the community based sentence for assaulting the petitioner and threatening the mother with a knife. Separations and disruptions in the family were the norm. The respondent's criminal record acquired during the time he lived with the respondent speaks volumes about his ability to meet the needs of his children. 4) In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person With a sufficient Interest, the court should consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, (c) how the relationship was represented to the world, whether the applicant provided financially for the child and the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. 5) In this case, the respondent demonstrated he is someone of sufficient interests. The Court cannot conclude that he lacks the means to establish a familial relationship with his child. The presumption that it is in the petitioner's best interests that she have access to him is of more consequence to the legal position that he has argued. Even though he may be considered a person who has demonstrated a settled intention to treat his own child as his own, that determination would not elevate him to status greater than that of person with sufficient interest under the Act.

e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the concept of “parties to the offence”, “principal offender” and secondary offender. The three elements of s. 34(2) have both subjective and objective components: (1) the accused reasonably believed that he was assaulted; (2) that he caused the injuries to Dorion; (3) that his belief in himself was objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (4) that knife believed on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of Dorion. In all of the circumstances, the Crown established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The court reviewed the various pieces of evidence and concluded that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2). All three elements must be established: the subjective perception of the accused, the objective foresight of specific wounds, and the fact that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking the victim."
c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.  2)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused's evidence of the accused. The officer testified that he stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece of his vehicle. He said he waited for the ready light to come on. He got an imbalance signal from the machine. He stopped the test and blew three times in all. 3)The accused did not provide adequate instructions to the officer as to what to do with the sample or how to provide the appropriate instructions. There was no reason he could not provide the sample on a day that he did not have access to the machine and he had to blow the sample himself. 4)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. The police officer was aware that the accused had three beers the whole night. He slowed down and did not inform the accused of anything. He told the accused he would be charged with refusal when he was informed that he had been issued a notice to refuse the breath sample. 5)The Court accepted the accused’s evidence that he failed to provide adequate sample as he was unable to understand why things did not work on the night in question and that the officer was not able to understand how he was asked to provide such a sample. The Court was not satisfied that he provided adequate instructions as to when and where the sample should be provided.

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact."

The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T.

At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in bankruptcy pursuant to the BIA Rules. Notice of Objection to the application was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor who was a former 28-year employee of the Company.

Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. HELD: 1) The definition of “manufacture” in the Act is extremely broad as it says “any step taken”. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the company that included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log home market. These steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forestry Product Processing Facility Licence. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the loghome industry. 2) The defendant did not have a Forest Products Processing Facility licence. 3) The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The nature of the business as noted in the corporate registry is logging, manufacturing building products. It creates a two tiered system of processing facilities, those that process product originating from Crown Forest Land and those that only process product from private land."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIOPA) for information about the various provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined certain allegations made against him. The respondent later appealed the refusal of the disclosure sought. The appellant argued that he had been aware of the allegations and knew of the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that inquiry. He also argued that the respondent had been misleading and had failed to disclose important information about his background, work and employment history. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P., the Department of Justice, the Departmentof Community Service and the ADR Program became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Acting Commissioner. 2)There was much publicity and media attention. 3)In the course of the trial process there was a considerable amount of information exchanged between the respondent and the Justice Department. It was important to maintain the confidentiality of all of the information that was exchanged, especially regarding the credibility of claims made against the respondent. The integrity of the process was at the forefront of the decision-making process. 4)The respondent was intimately familiar with the investigation and protection of privacy provisions in the Act. He had been intimately involved in the creation and execution of several of the investigative reports that were made as part of that investigation. The extent to which certain investigative reports and statements could be put to the benefit of the administration was also discussed. 5)There were numerous errors and omissions by the respondent in the investigation of these matters. The errors were inexcusable and should be set aside for the purposes of the proper investigation.  6)A review officer was appointed by the Minister of Justice to review and modify the compensation process. He reviewed the entire scope of the inquiry and found that most of the recommendations made by the inspector were completely and totally false. The recommendations were based on the totality of the evidence obtained as a result of the independent investigation into the systemic sexual and physical abuse in the institutions. The process was transparent and effective in allowing the respondent to participate and to minimize the impact on other claimants. The resulting damage resulted in the respondent being compensated in the amount of $24,000."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant denies any negligence, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. The defendant sold the building to the tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenants purchased the building from the landlord in 2008 and retained it for seven years. In the spring following purchase, the tenant visited the restaurant. There, water leaked into the premises from the roof, damaged ceiling, flooded the restaurant for several days and the tenant notified the landlord about the problem. The floor is always clean and well maintained. Only a small part of the moisture entering into the building is due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. The evidence does show that a part, but only part, of moisture entering the subfloor was due to negligent negligence by the tenant. The plaintiff is awarded judgment in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] for economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: 1) The tenant was awarded judgment against the landlord.  2) The damage to the floor was $22,281 and it was found that the tenant was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. 3) The court accepted the tenant's expert's opinion that the problem was caused by moisture arising from structural defects. The installation and maintenance of the floor in 2001 was of the view that water in the basement could cause the problem with the tiles but did not test for moisture or humidity levels within the building material, nor did he test the ceiling."

The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He displayed pictures of aborted fetuses on his signs. He took photographs of the demonstration. He also displayed messages that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids. He carried signs that read 'Planned Parenthood Aborts Babies'. He displayed these messages while demonstrating outside Planned Parenthood's Sexual Health Centre. He shouted them at patients and potential patients of the health care facility that were against abortion, and displayed images of aborted fetal fetuses. These facts supported the conclusion that the applicant was guilty of professional misconduct. The SAPLN takes the position that the Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act. Several factors should have been taken into consideration, among which the procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. Other factors included the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the plaintiff. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of the SCIC. At various times the plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. HELD: The portions of the affidavit that were not evidence were not used as evidence. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The court was very disappointed with the trial judge's decision.  1) It is critical that the court have an opportunity to hear both parties in this action on evidence in chief and under cross examination.  His inquiry of March 12, 1997 made it clear that the lawyer giving the undertaking did not intend to accept personal responsibility and was hoping for a resolution of the matter of the Applicant's account.  2) The portion of the affidavits dealing with the claim and interest as provided for in the statement of claim are not evidence but hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word 'protect' puts the question beyond doubt. 3) In respect to the action under the General Rules (Q.B. Rule 129), Rule 488, it is not an appropriate case under the simplified procedure. 4) The affidavit given by the respondent is absolutely clear. It is an undertaking given to a solicitor to protect an expert witness for its professional fees.  5) The Court was not surprised by the defendant's pursuit of the case. The strong concerns expressed to the respondent resulted in the March 5, 1993 undertaking. The respondent agreed to defer payment of his account from the parties until the successful conclusion of the litigation with SCIC, provided he received interest on the amount outstanding to the applicant at a rate of 12% per annum.  6) The defendant has sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the lawyers of the Law Society."

He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea.

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which related to his failure to recognize stopped vehicles in an active construction zone. The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and caused the death of three young boys. The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of the boys, who was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle, suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left humerus. He also suffered from short-term and long-term memory issues. The three boys' names were on the victim impact statements and the accused was sentenced to six years imprisonment. The Court was satisfied that the accused had not only travelled on Highway No. in Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and in particular, through the construction zone south of Spalding, but also had driven through a construction zone several times.

He failed to recognize the stopped vehicles, to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to safe stop before colliding with the rear of his vehicle.  4)The aggravating and mitigating factors as outlined in s.718.2 of the Criminal Code were appropriate but not sufficient to indicate fatigue. The totality principle must also be applied by the Court in determining what the ultimate sentence should be for the accused.  5)Individual sentences of less than 6 years were imposed for dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm.  6)The sentences imposed were based on the facts as contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts and the pre-sentence report filed with the Court.

The respondent bore the larger share of the responsibility for breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. The parents were both very good parents.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the Judicial Centre to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

The corporation is a farming corporation and its sole asset is lands held for farming purposes. The defendant has no rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor. The claim for a lien is not made out.  1) Given the totality of what was before me, the general rule that a solicitor's lien can be raised against all persons claiming through the client must be qualified by consideration of whom the rights accruing from the lien are claimed. 2) The shares in the corporation are exempt from seizure pursuant to The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm security Act. 3) The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if still in possession of them.  4) The court concluded that the end result of the seizure and sale of Jensen's shares will be sale of farm lands.

c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced by the defendants. The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with the CMHC through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer.

At issue was whether the defendants had waived their fiduciary duty by interposing the affirmative defence of good faith reliance on the government's regulations and communications. HELD: The plaintiff was granted leave to make further disclosure. The application for exclusion was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to discovery and then by attending the discovery and in the absence of objection evinced an intention to partially waive it.  2)The documents sought were found to be incomplete. 3)Although the plaintiff had been aware of the defendant's counterclaim and his position for period now approaching three years, he did not raise the barrier of solicitor-client privilege which would have prevented the disclosure of the evidence.

The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench.

The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by Ms. Thompson to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen's Bench for appropriate disposition or to address further cost and delay we have decided to do the latter. [2] Turning to the merits, we note that the principal question is whether the imputed allegations in the Statement of Defiant and Counterclaim meet the requirements of Rules 173 and 149 of the Queen’s Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. But without at least giving Carry the Kettle First Nation the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations cannot fairly be struck out as not answering to requirements of Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps."

The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The application is granted. The matter is directed to the Court of Appeal. 1) There are some distinguishing features. The original transaction between the School Division and the Flads was not concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, the Court was able to direct the trial of an issue where the facts are not in dispute (ie. there is no question of the right of the applicant with no reservation of his rights) and resolution of the matter could be achieved in minutes or hours. 3) The application for a writ of mandamus was granted on the facts of the case but after a full hearing at trial as opposed to the summary fashion in which the order was requested in the present case. The parties should have an opportunity to make submissions as to the framing of the issues, who will bear the burden of proof in the issues as framed and what procedures should be followed."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses. The costs owed by the petitioner to the respondent are set-off against the amount owing; the respondent shall pay $3,452 to the child's outstanding debts by or before February 15, 2011.","The applicant brought an application to vary paragraph 1(b) of the order of Wilson, J. She sought an order that the child was still a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by the respondent for some of the child's extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education. The parties were unable to settle the sharing of the children's educational expenses for 2008/2009. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay $4,452.00 in full and complete satisfaction of any claim for retroactive child support for 2008-2009. 2) The amount paid by the applicant should be matched by the Johnson company. The father must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The Educational Assistant Program offered at Confederation College in Thunder Bay, Ontario is a student loan of $5,430.00. The applicant is responsible for two loans. The respondent's total annual income for 2008 was $36,518.00 and his tax return for 2008 reflect a total income of $66,869.99.  3) Costs ordered by Pritchard. Both the respondent and the applicant deposed that they were fully supportive of the applicant's choices throughout and that the burden is on the applicant to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. The Chamber judge declined to look beyond the provisions of clause 3(2)(b) which is engaged by clause 3.2(a) having regard to the actual means and needs of the petitioner and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to her support be considered. 4) In Hagen v. Rankin 2002 SKCA 13 (CanLII), 213 Sask. R. 198 (QB) the court advised that the amount claimed as Amanda's expenses for her year at school are excessive and do not bear proper relationship to her parents' ability to pay. However in the face of these concerns being raised by the petitioner, she has given me no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. In all of the circumstances, it is the Court's view that the father should match the amount paid to the applicant towards her expenses. It is the petitioner's responsibility to fund her own education, particularly when it appears she failed herself to achieve some success."

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, was killed when her car was struck from behind by an uninsured motorist. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock, claiming Section 139 of the Insurance Act. The defendant argued that family members may claim for damages as a result of their entitlement as provided in the Fatal Injuries Act. HELD: The Court found that such a claim was not the result. The plaintiff was not a person insured under the contract, but was not directly involved in the accident and was entitled to recover. The Court also found that the emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties to the insurance policy.

Rule 25.01 requires that the parties file an agreed Statement of Facts, save in exceptional circumstances, such as one where the material facts are clearly not in dispute.","This was an appeal from the decision of a chambers judge striking the appellant's Statement of Claim. The appellant and the respondent had been equal shareholders in a company that incorporated Gorbin. The allegation was that the appellant placed a second mortgage on a property owned by the company without the Gordon's knowledge or consent. Gorbin's shareholder's resolutions and banking resolutions required the signatures of both Gordon and the appellant on legal documents and cheques. The applicant first became aware of the mortgage in 1982 when it was foreclosed upon. In August 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent banks.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered by the respondent.

The evidence before the court is that the Back-Track matter and the BASF matter were separate actions. The last bill was not given to the respondent until after July 16, 2007. There were discussions between the respondent and the applicant concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered, and for a period of time thereafter.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 of the Charter by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The accused argued that the police were acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when they forcibly entered the home in response to a disconnected 911 call. He alleged that the call to the police was not a 911 call, nor was it a distress call, but rather a call by an alleged victim or from the accused's residence. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction, that the trial judge erred in law in determining the police's authority to enter a residence, whether invited or not, and in searching to ensure that there were no other occupants. The evidence found as result of the searches was excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding 911 emergency response calls and found that in the particular circumstances, which the accused was found guilty of several drug offences, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence. They entered the premises to ensure there were not any other occupants and to search to ensure he had no weapon. The trial judge failed to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of the home, all without a search warrant. In the circumstances, the call which triggered the police response was not 911, by the alleged victim, or from his home. At this point, she was still inside with the person reported to have abused her, and possibly under his control."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any opportunity to respond to those allegations. 3) The hearing notice was properly served personally and the tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed to proceed to the hearing or for the tenant to vacate the premises. 4) In these circumstances, the tenant's request for an adjournment was not properly considered by the hearing officer. The disregard of the tenant’s request for a further hearing was unreasonable and inconsistent with the principle of access to justice that must guide judges and administrative tribunals alike in the conduct of their hearings. 5) The tenants’ right to complaint was violated. 6) The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and failure to provide the tenant with the particulars of her claim constitute reversible error. 7) The tenant was advised of the difficulty in arranging for a new hearing and of the costs associated with it."

The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of a doctor, who claimed to be the son of the deceased doctor and sought entitlement to his late father's estate by 1998. The third action was commenced by the wife of a medical specialist. She claimed that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached including that proof in Solemn Form would be required, with the case to be tried by the Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia sitting in Probate. Jurisdiction to hear a case flows from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the Pre-Confederation Court, pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court. There were myriad factual and legal issues to be considered but perhaps the three most central matters were the subject of this litigation. The wife's testamentary capacity was in no way affected."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant's legal allegations are properly pleaded. In doing so, courts are not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 2) The defendant has a duty to defend because the exclusion clause does not apply. 3) The defendants are negligent and breach the contractual and other duties owed by the insurer. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to cause the insurer to provide defence. The insurer must look beyond the choice of labels and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleadings. This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit; all court must do is decide, based on the true nature of the claims. 4) The soverign policy is a three step process. The essence of the claim is that the roof of the Nucleus Unit failed prematurely. It alleges that the proposed Foil Backed Insulation is unsuitable for use in a swine barn and its use would materially affect the maintenance, durability and longevity of the building. 5) The plaintiff is awarded costs of the action."

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the home.

The issue turned to Rule 15. 2)The Court was prepared to provide directions. 3)The Rule 15 set forth in Rule 15 did not stay the execution of a judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or maintenance for a child or dependant adult. 4)No notice of appeal was granted.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order (2014) requiring the respondent to comply with the February 3, 2014 order. The development officer of the RM applied for an order declaring the respondent in contempt of court for his failure to comply (dismissal of equipment, breach of zoning order); and for solicitor and client costs. The respondent contends that he has not complied with the orders nor has he done as much as he can to comply. HELD: The application for the contempt order is granted and the matter is adjourned to February 2, 2015. The court is satisfied that this is a situation that calls for a complete or near complete 'indemnification for costs reasonably incurred' by the respondent. Significant additional costs may be incurred by the RM and added to the tax rolls for Parcel A and became payable by the Schmidt if he does not purge his contempt within the time allotted by the court and before the RM moves to remove the offending equipment from the property.  1) Contempt proceedings are not for punishment per se, but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders. 2) The Court is concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the Schmidt. 3) In this case, the respondent has clearly not liked how the Zoning Bylaw impacts his personal interests and he has therefore chosen not to complywith it."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord.

The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","FIAT.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While it was true the income of the applicant had dropped and she had not established that she could be self-sufficient, the respondent's counsel took the position that the applicant was advised by counsel prior to signing the agreement and that she was advised beforehand that she would be required to upgrade her skills and confined herself to the role of homemaker and/or housewife. 2)Costs of the application were declined.

Even if the plaintiff could prove that the debris in his yard was solely from the sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient. There was nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on the plaintiff was greater than expected for the community he lives in.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had a long record of offences, including eight weapons related offences, four break and enter, one of which was aggravated assault (s. 145(3) of the Code), and one of several break and enters (museums). The Crown called expert evidence about street gangs and gang activity in the prison. There was evidence from the correction workers employed at the prison where the accused worked. At the prison, the accused was given a four-hour pass to work on a potato farm. He did not return within the time frame and was arrested at 11:00 p.m. that day. HELD: The Court held the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code. The Court found that the accused's actions were not premeditated and were of limited duration as shown on the video surveillance DVD. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements for imprisonment. A long term offender order was imposed for the accused who was between the ages of fifteen and twenty-three years. The sentences were to be staggered and include periods of detention in the penitentiary. The predicate offence, aggravated assault, was to be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years."

At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease.

The plaintiff has not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as a result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant, both farmers, became involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land owned by the respondent. The defendant listed his farmland for sale on an online auction platform. The respondent listed his land in an attempt to create an open bidding system to allow farmers to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.  1) By inquiring into the words used by Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola and their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. 2) In the first telephone conversation, the plaintiff registered for a Farmers Post account. The second telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The conversations are all that possibly created a contract of purchase and purchase of farm property.  3) The central issue in the contract of acquisition and purchase is the requirement of writing under the Statutes. The essential elements of a valid contract are the essential elements that make it work, whether the agreement was enforceable, whether there was a consensus among the parties, and whether compliance with these essential elements is the only determinative step. The test of agreement for legal purposes is whether the parties have indicated to the outside world, in the form of the objective reasonable bystander, their intention to contract and the terms of such contract. The law is concerned not with the parties' intentions but with their manifested intentions. What was reasonably understood between Mr. Piola and Ms. Petri was that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone conversation. 4) The plaintiff was awarded specific performance and damages in the amount of $50,000.  5) The court accepts that the respondent, with his daughter and son-in-law, and his wife, Donna, are equally credible witnesses.  6) The standard deviation between the paragraphs between paragraphs is 1/2 as long as the paragraphs are longer than the paragraph average. 7) The paragraphs that are the basis of the paragraphs in the"

Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal was heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The court found that the appellant had not met the onus on him under s. 679(4)(a) of the Criminal Code to be much more stringent than for an appeal against conviction."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties married in 1982 and were divorced in 2001. They have two children, aged 23 and 19. The oldest child, who was not a child of the marriage at the time of the application, left the charge of his parents and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his siblings. He and his partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The issues raised were retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and their contribution to the section 7 (special expenses) expenses for the children. The respondent argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. HELD: 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the older child.  2)The court reviewed the law as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue of retroactive child support and determined that the principles regarding retroactive and blameworthy conduct applied equally to s. expenses. There was no evidence that the respondent had disclosed the claim to the petitioner prior to the date of effective notice. It was clear that the parties had decided that they were independent, financially and otherwise from their parents. 3)The respondent's application to vary was retroactive to July 2004. This is also the year when the petitioner first applied for the award of s.7. The parties agreed that the corollaries of the agreement and the Ontario Court of Appeal had awarded retroactive support of $2,000 to the younger child. 4)The trial judge could not be blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. 5)The parties' failure to provide formal notice of the petitioner's claim for a retroactive change in child support should not deprive the petitioner of the right to an award for this type of support. The trial judge must be aware of the respondent's informational advantage to justify his/her deficient child support payments.  6)Judgmentality was not required in this case. The Court held that it was appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died on August 8, 1999 at the age of 86. The only evidence which suggested Ms. Wright was not mentally competent at the time of her death was that of her daughter, who had transferred her daughter's money to an estate account. The court found that approximately $50,000 of the plaintiffs' money was missing. The plaintiff was entitled to her costs plus $4,875.00 in taxed costs.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues.

(3) the Farm Land Security Board ought to complete it mandatory tasks under Section 12 under the Act and provide a report in the format described in the legislation. 4) the apparent refusal by the respondent to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review as information is available from other sources to deal with the matters in Section 12 (12)(a) and (b). The review if necessary could express the limitations evident from any refusal by any respondent to participate. The Board may apply incentives to the respondent by following the procedures in s12(4),(5) and(7) of the legislation but the only material before me indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' obligations under the Corollary Relief Judgment and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2003, when the children left the mother's care and moved with their father to Scotland, to pursue employment and self sufficiency. She claimed that she had no income and that if the father were to receive the garnishee he would have to pay directly to her. She alleged that he owed her $52,000 in spousal and child support for the 2005 and 2006 years. Monthly payments of $1,836 were made to Maintenance Enforcement in the amount of $163.92 and the balance was deducted from the husband's ongoing support payments. The husband continued to pay support as originally ordered. In the absence of any evidence that he was taking in more income as a result of his child support payments than he was retaining himself, the parties came away from this relationship with few, if any, assets and very little by way of retirement plans. One has to consider the excess payments over and above the mandatory support payments; the parties lived together for most of the past 3 years and had four children, aged 11, 13, 14 and 18 years. The history of the children leaving their mother’s care and either moving in with their parents or being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven; the husband was paying support directly and the wife was assisting him financially. The wife had no means to pay child support herself and her expenses were borne by the father in the form of rent, utilities and maintenance. She had no savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home when the parties were divorced and had no equity in it. The parties lived in poverty with few prospects for employment and little means to build their retirement savings. Husband paid child support from time to time but did not have the means or financial means to meet his obligations"
7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. This funding was depleted during the period of suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: There is no dispute on the facts. Both parties relied on the record developed in earlier proceedings. In the context in which the question arises, and the object and purpose of the policy, the exclusivity of the jurisdiction extends to judging that the university satisfy standards that are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere. It is important to maintain the integrity of the college's supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies, and potential financial implications for itself, if it should make an exception. The fact that the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that systemic forces were at work beyond the student's control."

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words in question had been posted at the Hospital and on the Union's website. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. Dr. Rubin was recruited by the Union and became the Director in 2002. He was then forced to return to his previous position as full-tenured Professor at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine. He commenced an action in defamation against the University and the Union claiming general damages of over $200,000, which were fixed at $300,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation. The appeal and the fixed damages were both dismissed."

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.

b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, in his will, the residue of his estate. A few years later the couple signed a separation agreement. They subsequently divorced. In 2008, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement, which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the right of the testator's former spouse to renounce any inheritance under the will. The deceased had not changed his will nor had he revoked or changed the beneficiary designation in the Canada Life Policy. The executrix applied to have the gift of the deceased's estate bequeathed to the appellant. The appellant appealed the order. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed. He relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra; he failed to give any meaning to the express words used by the jurists in the decision. He failed to consider whether the former spouse had expressly renounced any right to share in the estate of her brother; whether the appellant had immediately renounced her right to have any inheritance in the Will by signing the Separation Agreement or whether she had contractually bound herself to renouncing any inheritance after the death of her husband. The parties signed two separate separation agreements, one prior to and the other almost 3 years after their separation. The second and informal disclaimers were incorporated by reference into the corollary relief judgment. Both cases make it clear that a spouse's right to claim against the estate or to share with her spouse or any other person appears to be distinct from a testator’s right to confer benefit voluntarily. The common law requires that a disclaimer in order to be effective be made after a death of a legator, that is to say when the legatee is entitled to inherit the estate as they saw fit. However, the nature of a disclaimer at common law and its retroactive effect to the date of a former spouse lead to the same result. In this case the trial judge did not decide the second issue before him which pertained to the distribution of the estate."

The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate.

During that period, the respondent contributed to a pension plan valued following his death at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00) and the Respondent was separated from his wife, the biological mother of the applicants. The applicant argued that the respondent was not a spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees of the respondent and the Pension Benefits Standards Act and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent applied to have the respondent removed as administrator of the estate and for the payment into the estate of the pension plan entitlement earned by the applicant and the respondent. Application dismissed; it was clear that the removal of the personal representative was not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' and would only be so if the intended lawsuit with the respondent were feasible."
6_1994canlii4076.txt,"The parties divorced - the appellant later appealed the trial decision dividing property between them as separated spouses. Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The respondent had since gone bankrupt and the appeal had been allowed. The appellant contended that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge was nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The Chambers judge held that he would grant the order respecting examination of the records respecting Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel with two limitations; the examination should be limited to income received by the respondent and the examination would only cover material from that time forward. Dismissing the appeal, that while the two restrictions were insufficient to limit full disclosure, the appeal was allowed because the Court was definitely not satisfied with the disclosure of the respondent respecting his fishing licenses and vessels. The new trial was ordered so that all relevant evidence respecting these items in contest could be obtained."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act and a $3,000 fine was imposed as sentence. The defendant appealed the conviction on three grounds: the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; The trial judge failed to apply the doctrine of stare decisis; and the verdict was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in the case of R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid the offence. A reasonable person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence or to exercise extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. 2)The system implemented by the defendant in R. vs. W.Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure used by Westfair in this case.  3)The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, the defendant had an established system created to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of reasonable person.  4)The defendant received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired. The policy generally states that tobacco cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. If person looks as though there are under 25 years of age or if there is any doubt about the customer's age, then the customer should be required to provide identification to the cashier before they can purchase tobacco. If the customer refuses to provide an identification, the sale should be refused or the manager or supervisor should be called. This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. 5)A Summary Conviction appeal under s.813 can be heard from a summary conviction court on the basis that it is erroneous in point of law, it is excess of jurisdiction, or it constitutes refusal or failure to exercise jurisdiction. The evidence at trial suggested that this burden had not been satisfied because the defendant could have given the cashiers training on age evaluation, they could have used in-house test shoppers, they had used in‑house testing of shoppers, and they had made it difficult to override the cash register software system which prompts the Cashier to enter the customer’"
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The applicant company appealed its assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall, known as the Normanview Mall. The company was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee as it did not rely upon the sale verification information. The issue was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision to include the sale of the mall in its determination of an appropriate MAF. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The assessment of the shopping mall came to rest on the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. 2) The Committee found nothing requiring them to either exclude the sale from consideration in calculating the MAF or to adjust the sale price beyond the adjustments he had already made. 3) While the Committee relied upon the sales of each of the malls in calculating their fair value, it could not reach the conclusion on the basis of the sale verifying information to the exclusion of other relevant information open to consideration. 4) The company did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of a sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on information at his command, including information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. One of the reasons the Committee chose not to appeal was because the Committee was not convinced that it had erred. 5) On the issue of the amount paid pursuant to Document 1.1.6, the Court was not persuaded that it was an error of law."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties. The two parties seem content to receive assets mainly in the value of their car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment also provides that the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. HELD: The Court must refuse the application. 1)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal judgment was anything but unconscionsable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently unfair the proposal was to her. The parties do not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It is certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. 2)There was not equality in bargaining positions between the petitioner and respondent. The Court did not attend nor did she file any material on her own behalf from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she has thereunder. The terms of the proposed consent judgment were improvident. 3)The Court could not condone the use of legal advice and guidance but would strongly urge the petitioner to acquiesce and seek legal guidance and advice. The petitioner could not request legal advice or advice on his behalf nor would he be encouraged to do so. In such circumstances the Court could neither condone nor favor legal advice nor guidance on how to properly advise and assist the petitioner/Respondent. The court could only request legal counsel and advice on her behalf but would not urge her to seek legal assistance or advice. 4)The parties did not need court order or judgment. The wife was not seeking legal counsel nor advice. She was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000 per year while the petitioner earned $48,000."

The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants in the Halifax fire department was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleged the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain which was based on written tests. The applicants claimed the employer had interfered with the union's ability to conduct job competitions every two years. Dismissing the application for a stay of proceedings, that a substantial number of the members of the fire department were affected by the arbitrator's decision. The Union's position that the costs should go with the arbitration award, with some ripple effect, but of very limited nature. The movement that might have been brought about if those who were demoted could not act as servants had dissipated if not entirely disappeared, at least in the short run. Those who had been demoted did suffer some loss of pay and lost their positions."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider the factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer's belief that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer’s contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review is correctness and the standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 2) On the factual and legal grounds, the appeal court may assess the evidence, which is measured on appeal against the yardstick of correctness (see R. v. Shepherd). The appeal court must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of a trial judge, especially in matters involving findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence. 3) The officer had four and one-half years’ experience at the time of the offence. He was not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment. 4) The appellant challenged the objective basis for that belief, namely that there was not sufficient evidence for the officer to believe that she was impaired or that her behaviour was out of the ordinary. 5) The standard for assessing credibility can only be assessed with great deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the court should not be disturbed."

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties.

HELD: The application is to have formal judgment issued and to vary that decision in favour of her having primary residence and in the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, the application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes V. expressing a desire to live full time with R. If a variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, the Voice of The Child report will be required to be prepared. Costs of the report are to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.  1) The parents are significantly strapped financially and as such declined to make an order allocating costs to them. 2) The parties are prohibited from having any contact with the applicant or having any discussions with her regarding the matter. 3) The application to have the Court order the issuance of a Voice Of The Child Report is not allowed to occur until after the hearing of the applicant’s full affidavit and after the publication of the full report. This matter is of particular interest to the applicant because it would assist in ascertaining what custody and access plan the applicant is in the best interests of her and her children.  It is also of interest that at least one of these matters be heard by an impartial and professionally trained individual who can advise the Court in that regard.  4) There is an independent assessment of the wishes of each parent regarding their proposed move back to Assiniboia and there is a resumption of a shared parenting arrangement. It is appropriate to ascertain whether the appropriate order at the time is the commissioning of a voice of the child report and if so, it ought to then be undertaken prior to ruling on the variation application.

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the robbery. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial Judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem. The trial judge suspended the sentence, imposed a three year probation order, and imposed a two year probation prohibition order. He is prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment. A prohibition order under s.100(1) of the Code should have been imposed. The sentence was not fit.The respondent was charged with the robbery which took place at a convenience store. He started off on alcohol and ended up on cocaine. He craved more of the drug. Events went downhill for the respondent after that. He only obtained $23.00 for his efforts. When walking back to his car after obtaining gas, he lost his way and sought directions from two men in a parked vehicle. They were police officers. At trial the respondent gave an inculpatory statement and expressed remorse, expressed regret, and expressed regret for the offence, which was not the work of a sophisticated professional criminal, but for what he had done."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.",The summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' which would have allowed charges to be brought in both provinces but for the fact that the Alberta information was not available in the Alberta court at the time of its swearing. The matter was adjourned for a hearing. The Crown appealed on the following grounds: 1) Was jurisdiction lost in Alberta?; 2) Did the Saskatchewan court lose jurisdiction as it specifically found that if there was a loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence?; 3) The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta. The court had not lost jurisdiction over the person in Alberta and could have regained it by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan.
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 210(m) of the Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The Director opposed approval of the arrangement on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal of FCC proposed to distribute all of its net proceeds to those of its shareholders who have 'proven claims in establishing their status as Shareholders rather than having portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA.'s rationale for the arrangement was that the Shareholders have already sustained a significant loss on their investment as result of the oppressive acts of former management. The plan proposed for the corporations contemplates an outreach or advertising program to be conducted over the next two years with the goal to reach at least some of the missing shareholders. The purpose of the plan is to allow the corporation to dispose of any property belonging to creditors or shareholders who cannot be found. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate for the purpose set forth in the Act.  1) The court could not find any evidence that the SCCA was being used by FCC for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. 2) There was no conflict between the mandatory requirements in s. 220 and 221 and the power given to the court in s.(l) with respect to the distributive rights of a shareholder, qua shareholder on dissolution. 3) The Court could exercise its power under s.210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in ss.220 and 221. 4) The proposed arrangement complied with all statutory requirements for an arrangement to be approved by the court and satisfies the criteria enunciated in the BCLA.

Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed.

He was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to s. 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 1)The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. 2)The wife's health was fragile and it was illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them. 3)The husband was to consider the length of time the spouses cohabited and the functions performed by the spouse claiming support. 4)Costs were divided equally. 5)The court reviewed the economic condition of the wife at the time of separation and found that $49,000 was the value to be divided."

b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116) must be dismissed. There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision regarding the alleged right not to associate."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not yet come to a Youth Court transfer and a concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. HELD: The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment. 1)The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction respecting offences committed by persons while under the age of 18 years. 2)Any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred between the dates of October 22 1986 and March 31, 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. She was not as young as he was when he was charged. 3)Although the accused was charged with sexually assaulting the complainant, she was not quite as old as she was when the indictment was made, and he was convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. He was 26 years old and had two children shortly after she turned 14 years of age from a more recent abusive relationship and is now trying to come to terms with what was done to her during her childhood."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a Swift Current police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The police observed the trailer and noticed that it was overweight. The officer stopped the vehicle and found that the trailer was operated by the accused. The RCMP had erected road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. The Provincial Court did not issue notice to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. The Department of Highways had also erected signs warning of an alternative truck route. No other notice was given to the general public. The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in their municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were located along #332 and #332 in various locations along grid roads. There was no publication in the Saskatchewan Gazette or in any other print media."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a child protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. The child was apprehended at birth and is the subject of a Child Protection Hearing. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act.  1)The Act does not authorize the appointed trustee to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of the child. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult children. Nowhere does the Act authorize the the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act. 3)The public trustee best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v. Magiera. Besides, no one else has come forward to fulfill that role.  4)The trustees were to be appointed as amicus curiae upon being satisfied that the child was unable to act for herself.

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff's radio station reported that a 12 year old girl had been sexually assaulted at a roller rink located close to Carpet World and across the street from the defendant's prison. The defendant denied the allegations, and the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. HELD: 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false,malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published. Nothing points to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff in its Roller Rink operation. 2)The evidence was that the defendants' newscast, which was based on information from the police, was a proven reliable source of information. 3)The plaintiff did not make any complaints to the police. 4)The court found that the plaintiff had not rebutted its allegations of sexual assault, nor did it raise any concerns with the Commission. 5)It did what it was requested to do and was exonerated almost immediately by its controlling body, the CRTC for doing so. The defendants published the news that it received from the Police, whom it had been assured would be a reliable source. 6)The Commission did not interfere with the station's reporting of the facts. 7)The Court awarded the plaintiff $12,500 plus costs."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to the treatment he might give. The doctor prepared a medical report for the hospital in response to a written request by the police, which included the results of the blood alcohol tests. The first blood sample was taken by the officer for medical purposes while the accused was unconscious contrary to an explicit refusal by the appellant to provide a blood sample under any circumstances. In the present case, the obtaining of the information from the doctor as the basis of formulating the demand is not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err when she found the appellant's rights under s.7 were not violated."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Ministry did not show that it had taken measurable steps to deal with the father's anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children's emotional and psychological state required them to continue to be in need of protection. The evidence showed the children struggle on an ongoing basis from the trauma they experienced at the hands of their father. The options in s. 11(a)(1) and (b) were premised upon a realistic prospect of change, within reasonable time and reasonable use of resources if needed. Neither parent had taken an active interest in the children for the past 3 years. The mother had no contact with the children since missing her last visit at the end of 2013. The father, once the letters were written, had no involvement with the Ministry. The Ministry made an application for a further 3 month temporary order. This order was granted by Kraus J. on December 31, 2013. S. 37 of the Act does not declare that only the best interests of the child shall be considered. The Court may be mindful of other matters as well."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under Queen's Bench Rule 331(f) or (b) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution or(c) the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. This matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike.  2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is that of a one-year period of time. 3) While one year is an excessive period, it does not lead me to the position that this claim should be struck on that basis. The delay is neither inordinate nor inexcusable. The time between service of the statement of claim and the application to compel the plaintiff to disclose settlement amounts is entirely attributable to the defendant. The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which the plaintiff settled its claim to be disclosed.  4) The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not a claim for wantof prosecution in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson, 2010 SKCA 48. The test for discharging the burden to establish an exception should not be set too low. The Court found that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. With regard to the period of delay it would be in the interests of justice to determine on a factor-by-factor basis whether a remedy of dismissing the claim would be available."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the child resides in Saskatoon. It is fair to adjust the respondent's ongoing childsupport payments as at November 1, 2006. Given that the applicant is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrear. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arreaars, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay the arroars and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 3) In the circumstances, the respondent is entitled to pay as little as $425 per month as child support, commencing in November 2006 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law, Richard Schmitt, as witness. The facts as outlined by the accused on the one hand, and by the Crown on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The defendant placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The second question must be answered in the negative: would the accused have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him? (2) Was the assault a contributing cause of bodily harm, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause? HELD: The accused was convicted of the assault as charged. The Court held that the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 8 of the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice or of being too vague. In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it was important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of death.

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. HELD: 1) The Court decided based on R. v. Nordstrom, 2006 SKQB 154 (CanLII), 259 Sask.R. 138, which held that the normal criminal rules of law apply. 2) The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. 3) The court found that the ordinary criminal rules, which apply in criminal trials, do not apply in this case. The court also found that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada were in admissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 4) In this case, the court held that s.810 hearings were not criminal trials. 5) It was not intended that the judge strictly apply the rules of admissibility. 6) The normal criminal rule of evidence applied. 7) Hearsay evidence is admissible in evidence. 8) The use of the phrase'satisfied by the evidence adduced' does not require formal sworn evidence such as viva voce evidence commonly called in criminal proceedings. The judge reviewed the business rules and found that business rules apply. The standard of review is correctness on a question of law basis and the test of credibility is based on the fact that the standard of proof for the trier of fact is reasonable ground to believe. 9) On the issue of costs, the Court was able to afford to pay solicitor fees. 10) Costs in the amount of $10,000 to the Crown in the form of solicitor-client costs. 11) The applicant is entitled to costs in any legal proceeding on production of the record. 12) The burden of proof is on the applicant."

On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted by a Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. He appealed both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, this discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. As such an application was not raised in this case, the questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of whether it was the appellant who was the driver of the truck at the time the collision occurred. 2)The appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath was prejudicial. It is clear that the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an 'alcohol problem' was put in issue. 3)In all of the circumstances of this case the appellant was, in the context, prejudiced by the questions and the responses of his own counsel. In the context of the entire cross-examination, these questions and his responses were relatively innocuous and did not play a major role in the evidence of the appellant."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of an dangerous offender. He also conceded that the trial judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter to the court stating that he was doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit. He then proceeded to commit another sexual assault against a young prostitute whom he had picked up and brought to the defendant's assistance. This offence occurred in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Both the defendant and the prostitute had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment which the experts acknowledged was pre-requisite for rehabilitation. Defendant appeals from this sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The judge was not bound to accept the assessment of two experts who were premised upon two assumptions. The first being that the reports of the defendant on remand were true and second, he assumed that the deceased was genuine when he stated he wanted to change. The second was that the judge was cognizant of the fact that, in 2002, the defendant had been previously incarcerated and had not participated in the sexual offender rehabilitation program. He was aware that the young offender involved in these offences had a history of aggressive, aggressive and irrational behaviour. It was clear that he had not rehabilitated as a result of the assaults and that his rehabilitation efforts had not met the onus on him to do so. 2) The defendant was found to be in good health and appeared to be doing well in the early stages of his rehabilitation. His rehabilitation efforts were focused on reducing his risk of re-occurring sexual offences and he was found not to have a substantial risk of repeat sexual assaults. The court was satisfied that his rehabilitative efforts were meted out to him over the course of five years. His sentence was determined to be indefinite. The predicate offences that led to his being classified as being sexual assaults were met with an indefinite sentence. He remained in custody until he pled guilty and was sentenced to an indefinite period of imprisonment. He appealed on the basis that the sentences imposed were not meaningful and that the court overemphas"
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and ordered that it be put up for sale without delay or impediment. The wife, on social assistance disability benefits, sought spousal support, to return certain personal belongings and a reinstatement of her benefits under the wife's health insurance plan. The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold, claiming a reversible error in two respects: first, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and secondly that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. The judge ordered that the matter should be remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis; and second, that the wife should return all of her belongings to the husband, who would then have to deal with the sudden return of certain valuable personal belongings. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and did not require any comment from the Court, should he choose to take up the case again. The facts and history of the case were obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.C-8.2 as am. and The Children's Law Act,1997, SS.1997 as am have been issued pursuant to the Children’s Law Act and Family Maintenance act, 1997. 2) The petitioner was actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further the court was not prepared to impute an explanation of the reasons for the increase in arreaars. 3) The respondent was cognizant of the fact he agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable in 1992. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years.  4) The court was aware of the petitioner’ s farming operation which affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.

2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed for a short period of time, a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be amarked departure from that of a reasonably prudent driver. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. There was no indication that the driver slammed on the brakes, rather, the vehicle slowed substantially prior to the officer activating the emergency lights. The posted speed limit in Moose Jaw is 60 km/h. There were condominiums well back from the road. The driver of the Mustang was observed accelerating for two to three blocks at a rate of over one hundred and forty kilometres an hour. The observed traffic was heavy and the officer noted that there was a church on one corner, school on the northeast corner and a playground nearby. Speed alone could not be characterized as dangerous driving."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) In the case of adjudicator appeals, the applicant has not satisfactorily explained why it was that he did not file the appeal within 21 days after receiving formal notice. There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. 4) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. The consequences for inaction parallel those of defendant who is noted for default as a result of his failure to file a statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. 5) There are two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The first is that where a judgment is filed in this Court that it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. The second is that appeals are statutorily based and if there is no foundation in statute, there is a need to exercise discretion to grant an extension. The principles and considerations that apply to 'adjudicator appeals' are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. The Court has jurisdiction to open up the certificate and to grant equitable relief to the applicant. 6) The Court is not without jurisdiction in the areas of extension of time to serve statutory appeals. Time limits must be strictly enforced. There was no firm date set and the discussion occurred as stated in the affidavits of the labour standards officers. 7) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. It would be unfair to hold a party to an arbitrary deadline and to deny them the right to proceed to adjudication."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of his patients. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling in favour of the use of the AU code. Appeal dismissed; cross-appeal dismissed. In order to properly assess its merit, it was necessary to look more deeply at the Payment Schedule. It contemplates that the Government has some authority to look behind the face of the accounts presented for payment. The aspects of the Protocol impugned by the physician characterizes it as an individualized administrative process. However, the Protocol is not an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice by or through the Protocol. Rather, it allows the Government to request more information about the services underpinning the accounts and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. Such matters, according to the physician, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the MCIA. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross- appeal must be dismissed. 1) The Protocol is obviously an individualization administrative process and the principles set out in the Protocol are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). 2) It is possible to raise an argument that refusal to pay accounts, or certain kinds of accounts, is inconsistent with sec. 18(2) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act (the MCIA). However, it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 3) In this case, however, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so. As a practical consequence of that decision, he received no payment for the services in issue.  4) Out of province beneficiary histories are to be assessed against the excel histories contained on the file. The Protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules' portion of the Schedule. In particular, it ties into the aspect of those Rules which states that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship between the service being billed and prior or subsequent services and in addition, may be adjust with reference thereto to the submission of claims for related services. 5) The standard deviation of errors in the calculation of error is 0.04. 6) The payment schedule is best characterized as an 'individual feature of the payment regime'."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. Defence argued there was no 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument. Application allowed; summary judgment entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed; costs in the cause of the action to be set aside. Although there was some evidence to support the defendant's argument, there was not an air of reality to it. Furthermore, the plaintiff was relying on credibility and the medical evidence at trial. If the brake lights did not work, the defendant drove straight into the rear of plaintiff's car and the traffic light turned red. To strike the plaintiff from behind on these facts would strike her too close or didn't have enough care or control of his vehicle."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties, who were married in 1986 and had four children, separated in 2004. The petitioner moved with the parties' two children to live with their father when they were living with their mother. The parties were unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements for the children. The respondent, who was 65 years old and retired from the federal government, drove a cab on a part-time basis. The wife was the primary parent and had three children from their first marriage. They separated in October 2005. They have not resumed cohabitation as husband and wife since that date. There is no possibility of reconciliation. The court ordered a final disposition pursuant to all corollary issues and ordered the parties to retain jurisdiction to make final disposition.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.

The defendant denies that it has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles for which the agreement was signed.

The Court was also required to deduct costs from the application.  3) In addition to the defendant having obtained the exclusive license from the plaintiff and the exclusive marketing agreement from the defendant, the defendant has also obtained a declaration by the plaintiff that it is not the only source for proprietary information obtained by it in the course of its business. The Confidentiality Agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff was not a patented process. While the defendant had a system of machines and equipment that were configured in a certain way so as to utilize an ion exchange and crystallization process, such was not only one that could be used to produce potassium sulphite. 4) The plaintiff was found to have a contractual and other relationship with the defendant based upon the fact that it had already established its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties and did not seek to sell or use that technology. The court was unable to determine that either of the parties had a contractual or other relationship. 5) The court ordered further and other ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age.

HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

An affidavit filed by the respondent states that there was an increased risk of adverse events including but not limited to suicide, suicidal tendencies, aggressiveness, hostility and mania associated with the use of Paxil but have continuously failed to warn consumers. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted. The cross-examination will not result in an injustice to the respondent but will assist the Court in applying the criterion set out in ss. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act to the certification application.  1) The common issues being put forward for certification will not enable the respondent to recover anything for the issues important to him. He will be confined to pursuing an individual claim. 2) The cross examination will not assist the court in applying its criterion of s. 6.2 of the class actions act. 3) There are a number of statements contained in the respondent's affidavit that, when considered in relation to the filing of an affidavit, invite clarification. 4) The applicant has assured the court that the proposed cross- examination is expected to take no more than 1-1/2 day and it will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by the applicant and plaintiffs' counsel. 5) The financial, emotional, physical and psychological stress that has been involved in the ordeal makes participating in the within action an important endeavour for the defendant. He is to be held accountable for the common issues. 6) There is no evidence to support the allegation that the affiant (or his family) did not pay for the Paxil.

e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. The claim for refund was dismissed and the assessment for health services conducted by the Provincial Tax Commissioner upheld. The appellant contended the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption in full. In reviewing the history of the legislation and particularly s. 10(1)(h)(I) and (j), it was concluded that the exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are used in the manufacturing process. The appeal was allowed and the appellant was awarded its costs. In Silver Spoons Desserts, Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), (1989), 89 N.S.R. (2d) 363; 227 A.P.R.(1d) 327 (S.C.A.D.) (Attorney General), (1987), and (W.L.R.) (retd) (j) (2000), (Ontario), (Nova Scotia), (Dec. 1986) were all made in the context of s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act. This was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Commissioner or the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code, and driving while over the legal border in violation of s. 27(5) of that Act. The police officer was on duty in uniform and driving a marked police vehicle when he observed the accused and passenger, both in the front seat and in the mid rear, proceeding west on 28th Street. The vehicle signaled right and the officer observed an out of date sticker on it's license plate. The officer engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. He asked the driver why he had not stopped and the accused gave a strong reply saying that he was in the lawful execution of his duty and that he had 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' The officer concluded that the words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers are employed within the province. The accused blew 170 and 160 on the breathalyser tests and 160 and 160 respectively on the first and third tests respectively. The Court concluded that both offences were charges and that both were proceeds of crime. The Police Act must be read in a fashion in which the legislature is not bound by its jurisdiction, and less grammatical or less ordinary meaning that will produce harmony is to be given the words, if they are reasonably capable of bearing that meaning."
2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs plus disbursements of $1,050.00 plus $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery rate the plaintiffs were able to recover.

A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General of money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS). The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(1) of the Income tax Act, ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the receiver. At issue was whether the Crown has jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s241(2) ordering the respondent to pay off the amount of $21,923 or some part thereof by the respondent. HELD: The respondent was found to be an officer and director of HRS at all times material to these offences. He operated the company with another unnamed investor. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HRS. It is the Crown's position that the authority of the Court to make an order under s238(2 falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine or penalty order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' Such matters were unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. 1)The Crown was not contesting the defence submission regarding the identity of these individuals. The evidence and submissions did not establish the existence of the matters set out in s232(2). 2)It was not established that either of the individuals, the office if any, held in HSRP or the accountant of that company, had been directly or indirectly involved in directing the deductions and necessary remittances. 3)The respondent was not relying upon an investor and the other investor. That money was held in trust by the appellant. The implicit inference to be drawn from those submissions was that either would have been more likely to be accepted given the defences and limitations did not apply to his liability under Section 242 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act nor to the sentence to be imposed pursuant to Section 238. Expressed in another fashion, the Crown, in light of the respondent's guilty pleas, need not establish matters set up in s241.1(2)). 4)The Court's jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to subsection 238(2 of the income tax Act is unaffected by bankruptcy proceedings. The ability to pay by respondent is a relevant factor to consider. It has been submitted that Mr. Henneberry"
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. The defendants sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA, and $40,000 security for costs. Application to amend the order was denied. The court exercised its discretion to order that the plaintiff be added as a plaintiff and that the statement of claim be amended in accordance with the draft Amended Statement of Claim."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. This was the inevitable result of the trial judge's decision that the certificate of analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and that pursuant to s24(2) the admission of the Certificate of Analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appeal is set aside and the new trial must be held and held in a fashion that meets the test of reliability and accuracy. The court erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results of the test, or should not have, if she had, the results could be inaccurate. It is unnecessary to review any subsequent facts as the primary issue on appeal is the correctness of that finding. The Court reviewed the facts in Einarson, supra, to those dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada in Bernshaw, supra and at paragraph 22 concluded: 22 There are several factual similarities between Bernshaw and this case. In both cases, the officers had proper reasons to make s. 254(1) demand and in both cases it was possible that the driver had taken his or her last drink. It was also possible that he drove onto the grid road to dispose of an open can. The mere possibility that a driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Clarke should not be required to answer questions which are not answered in the course of their investigation. 3) While there may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses incurred as a result of the action or to provide answers which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment, it is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so.  4) There is nothing in Clarke's response to the undertakings that would be inappropriate in any event of the cause. It is entirely up to the court to decide whether to accommodate the defendant. CN's application to tender the sketch as evidence at trial was premature and unnecessary. 5) The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which words say relate to what they say in the plaintiff's file is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. The plaintiff is obliged to answer based upon its current knowledge of the situation. 6) The applicant's refusal to provide proper answers to questions relating to the materiality of the claim and to the sources of information leading to the sketch are within the scope of the Court's jurisdiction to make an order."

The parties were given leave to file additional evidence on the issues which were in conflict. The additional evidence did not resolve the conflicts. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered that the solicitor withdraw as counsel and the parties may proceed to a pre-trial and a trial if necessary. 1) The court agreed that both lawyers should withdraw as set out in the contract. The only way to resolve the conflict would be by holding a viva voce hearing.  2) The client acknowledges that the only way is to have the parties' lawyers remain in the law firm and act as their lawyer at trial.

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. HELD: The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Rule 485 for summary judgment. 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. 2) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff is not entitled to indemnification under the by-laws. This is exactly the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, it has jurisdiction by the Court of Appeal to entertain this application. Exhausting internal remedies 3) The dispute in the fourth action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause in the Union by-law. 4) This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. 5) In short, this is precisely the same type of dispute that was not within The Bench Court as in the first, second and third actions. 6) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of a indemnity by law. 7) The parties at the meeting knew that the members at that meeting knew they were paying for the cost of the defence of the First Action but they did not have the means to do so. 8) As the dispute is in its essential character, contractual in nature, namely, is the plaintiff entitled to benefit from the indemnities clause? 9) It would be inequitable to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this application in the event the Union is not included in its own disputes."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and with intent to commit an indictable offence having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were serving time on remand at the time of their appeal. The Crown sought to have the accuseds sentenced to more than two years in federal penitentiary than is presently served. HELD: 1) The Court addressed the aggravating and mitigating factors as well as the effect of the violence committed against the victim. 2) The accused's criminal records showed failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The sentence that each of them will serve from this date is 2 years to be served in a federal penultimate. The Court took into account their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. They were sentenced to four months imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery with violence. 3) The sentences were based on principles outlined in s. 718 of the Code. The offences were committed against a person in a vulnerable position and were often required to work alone or with only one other co-worker. These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the third floor of the building and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged it owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. Liability and damages at issue in this case. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire and the door to the plaintiff's apartment was in a state of repair. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect and inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; the self-closing hatch on the north hallway door was continually in an open position; the battery operated smoke alarm in the apartment did not function at that time; the plaintiff was uninformed and unaware as to whether the smoke detector formed part of the Fire alarm system or was self-contained and the responsibility of the tenant."
6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.  1)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living with no dependents. The net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for a single person. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge. 2)While the court was not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with four counts of impaired driving. The accused argued that the certificate of analysis should not be admitted because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 a. m. to justify the breath demand. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the accused was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights, it should be excluded under Section 24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) The accused's own testimony that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment or at the 711, after drinking three or four beer within the preceding hour, was not enough to prove impaired ability to operate a motor vehicle. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is insufficient to prove impairment by alcohol. 2) The evidence was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. On all of the evidence, he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The only uncontroverted facts were that he had dropped his son and nephew off in the forest, and that they had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck. There were 14 rounds of ammunition located in the vehicle, which were compatible with the two rifles that were seized. However, there was no evidence that anyone else was being used to locate the defendant other than shining the spotlight. All of these facts supported the inescapable inference that the defendant was trying to obtain wildlife by means of hunting with the flashlight. The searchlight was not used to search for the defendant's nephew, who had been attacked by moose in the same forest, nor was it reasonable to expect him to be concerned that his son might have been injured by wayward moose."

The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son P.J.B. As their son does not reside in Saskatchewan but rather in Alberta, am of the view that he may well not be able to exercise the degree of access which he seeks or indeed has been granted by this Court in fiat being released concurrently with this one. HELD: 1 Saturday access period every two months would be appropriate under all of the circumstances. The Court ordered the addition of a fixed access period two months in advance.  1)It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents, and his paternal grandparents. The material satisfies me that the applicants are responsible individuals who have genuine affection and concern for the child. While they are separate relationships with unique characteristics to each of them, their relationship should be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with breaking and entering and theft. The charge was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused plead guilty to breaking and enter and stole property. The accused was convicted of being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm. The evidence in the case was that the accused had a Grade X education and that he had sporadic employment over his adult years. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a period of six years incarceration. The aggravating circumstances of the offences and the fact that the co-accused was driving the accused's vehicle off the road caused him to lose control of his vehicle and he was taken to hospital where he was admitted into the hospital. A further ten years of imprisonment would be justified."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to S.253(b). The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253.(b). HELD: 1) The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of Shire’s Charter rights. 2) There was no unlawful detention nor breach of the Charter. 3) In the circumstances of this case, the delay of approximately 17 minutes between the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the “forthwith” requirement of s.254(2). The evidence of the subsequent breathlyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of Shires Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s24(2) the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed. 4) There were circumstances that should have prompted the officer to embark on an investigation of his possible impairment by alcohol. However, what the officer chose to do was have Shire wait in the police vehicle because the search was being conducted at the side of the road. During this period, police observed an odour of alcohol and there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found within easy reach of the driver. The accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both of which resulted in a 'fail' reading. 5) The evidence obtained from the second breathalyzer and Certificate of Analysis is a transcriptive evidence, which was not included in the charge against the accused."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed $25,000 for damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. This was a minor problem and the sellers did not omit that the place had flooded on at least one occasion. The Claimant alleged the Defendants burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The shop vac was found on two different walls neither of which was the complainant's. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall behind the windows and on the floor in the recreation room. The claimants claim they suffered any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation, nor is any damage casually connected to any act or omission of the Defendants. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law, which is part of the make up that is imposed upon the litigants and those that hear the case. 1)The court reviewed the law on a motion for non-suit and found that the principles of merger and reasonableness in the application of the test in Pino v. Clahane were not lost on the court. 2)There was a fine balance between an adversarial process and an inquisitional process that raises itself often in Small Claims Court proceedings. 3)The doctrine of merger had been softened considerably in the sale of goods due to legislative intrusion but it has yet to take place with the real property. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. 4)The claim for damages was dismissed because of insufficient evidence. It was not necessary to consider the sufficiency of evidence without weighing the evidence or evaluating its believability to see if the Court had a case which was recognized by the law."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendants had each formed a new company under the company name of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. The operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, a beef operation, a trailer park and a gravel pit operation. The defendant sold the operation to three brothers. The three brothers each formed new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Lorne owning the trucking company. Gene became manager of the dairy operation in 1989 and was able to testify based on his knowledge of the relevant quota schemes and his experience as a result of the operation. He was also a lawyer. He drafted security documents for the defendant which showed the effective date of the new quota scheme. Gene testified that he was the drafter of the two documents and he drafted the agreements. He said he understood the agreement to mean that he and his father had to share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid Milk Quota and not all quota sold. He also indicated that he engaged an accountant for advice on possible conflict of interest. The plaintiff was awarded $33,800.00 in the amount of $45,000.00."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and threatening to kill after she confronted her husband with whom she had previously been. She was found murdered in her residence with the light outs and his car hidden from her view. The Crown tendered several statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous occasions. At the stage of the hearsay admissibility the trial judge must determine the procedure, whether by voir dire or otherwise, for the determination of admissiblilty. Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible. It could be used to show hostile behaviour by the accused that would lead to a motive to kill or to show that the evidence of similar facts is not tainted with collusion. However, the evidence may also be used as evidence to show a specific hostility and intention to harm the victim, which could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of evidence such as the resemblance to the victim's previous injuries and the fact that she had choked her husband. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence and its necessity and reliability and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) There must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The existence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the same evidence; and the strength of evidence that the events occurred are all admissible. 3) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition a hearsay evidence as it may distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.

Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The child was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The paternal grandmother did not participate in those proceedings. She now argues that a judge in Court of Appeal Chambers does not have the authority to make the order sought. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)Having considered the helpful briefs of counsel and the authorities, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade a Chambers judge to make an order. Even if he or she had jurisdiction to make it, the order would not be the order as, in my opinion, an application to leave to terminate the permanent care ordered appeared likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed. Nothing which had said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of the factual issues.  2)There are two bases on which the Court may add the party for the purposes of appealing. The first is that the Chambers judge has jurisdiction to deal with the application. The second is that there are a number of issues of fact surrounding the applicant's involvement with the child and the proceedings as well as the Society's communications with her. Nothing that had said on these grounds would in any way persuade the Court to grant the order. 3)Rule 62.01(j) is purely definition provision and should not be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction.

The first summons was never served on the Defendant. Of the other 2, only 1 was served on the Defendant. Further, although 1 garnishee was only served twice, it paid monies into court on 5 occasions. There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings. 2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor. 3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s14 of the Attachment of Debts Act paying out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. plus the interest thereon. The respondent was personally served with a garnishee summons but did not appear. The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. Sokulski, the respondent's DEFENDANT, applied to have the judgment set aside and if no appeal is taken the funds, including any accrued interest, will be paid to each of the defendants. HELD: The Court made no order as to costs as this chambers application would have been unnecessary had the proper procedures been followed in the first instance.  1)The Chambers judge exercised his discretion to set aside the judgment obtained against the non-appearing garnishees.  2)The money should be paid out. 3)The chambers judge erred by 'freezing' the money already paid into Court under the invalid garnisihee summons pending resolution of the trial of the action. There was no good case for the funds to be paid back to the defendants after the time for appeal has elapsed."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. In addition to apportioning costs, the plaintiff apportioned costs on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $50,000.00. The plaintiff submits that the award to the plaintiff, with interest for six years at 9.41 percent per annum and disbursements, less the Counterclaim, approximates the amount of the Offer to Settle. Counsel for the defendant states that he was not persuaded that the general rule of law, as applied in this case by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, should make an award realistic. The Court exercises its discretion and declines to award costs on the counterclaim."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","In an action for unpaid monies, Turf Masters obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been aware of the consultant's reports regarding site problems which were not included or otherwise disclosed during the tendering and contract process. Shortly after commencing the work, it recognized there were significant subsurface problems with the site which made their work more difficult and costly. It commenced an action against the city and the consultant in Quantum meruit alleging negligent misrepresentation based on the non-disclosure of the site reports. In this first action, the plaintiff brought a claim for breach of standard of care and possibly additional work which had to be performed because of the alleged undisclosed site conditions. In the second action, it commenced a claim against the City and its consultant, Jacques Whitford, alleging negligence or misrepresentation by the City. The plaintiff applied to strike out the statement of claim and the cause of action estoppel. HELD: The Court granted the application and dismissed the action. 1)On the basis of all of the affidavits, the first action as amended from time to time and as adjudicated, the agreed statement of facts and the present pleadings, the doctrine of res judicata and abuse of process were applied.  2)The Court was satisfied that to allow the plaintiff to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept would be an abuse of the process. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same issue.  3)The doctrine of 'damages of process' was not by itself determinative in this application. 4)Although there were some very broad statements that all matters which could have been raised are barred under the principle of 'disclosure', none of the cases actually demonstrated this broad principle. The issue was whether the party should have raised the point now asserted in the first plaintiff's action on a quantum meruit basis or whether it should have allowed it to proceed on its own."

Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. The respondent's 1996 income included the following: Employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy with unemployment insurance benefits $318.00 per month plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with the respondent's company was terminated. Her income from casual employment was sporadic. It was reasonable to assume that any income she earned in excess of $42.75 bi-weekly will be deducted from her UIC benefits. An attribution of income of $800 per month is fair for the current determination of maintenance. In terms of child support at an income level of $38,000 the respondent would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children or $388.00 for four children.

The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.

The purpose for the contract for installation was not achieved and there was a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time, but would rely on the former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that such a conclusion could not be made based upon the evidence. Accordingly, the appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. Amongst many factors, among them, the exclusionary clause in an agreement between the parties does not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc.

The application was deferred to permit the Court to deal with the substance of the matters raised by the respondents. At issue was whether KSS should be required to conduct an environmental assessment of the project pursuant to the provisions of s. 9 of TheEnvironmental Assessment Act because the project or operation is a development under the Act.

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian residential school. Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent's solicitor handling the claim advises no offer has been received. Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in the lawsuit involving his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement proceeds will be used to speak to the distribution of same. It is not offensive to direct that the defendant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the petitioner's counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the asset in debate."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the applicant. The applicant argued that this was an attempt by the Minister to quash the applicant's requests for records. The Minister had refused to supply the applicant with the complete medical record, file and chart of the applicant, her pediatrician, her family physician, the Early Intervention Clinic and the Capital Health Addiction Prevention and Treatment Services. Application granted; the applicant was to have the records prepared for an independent parental capacity assessment with psychological component. Although the applicant may not be a parent or guardian of the child, the Minister had an obligation to investigate any information that may be of interest to her, and to protect the privacy of witnesses and others whose names appeared in the records sought. This admission rendered further proof of the allegations irrelevant. The records were not relevant for this purpose. The application for the production of all of the documents requested was dismissed. The court found that the higher standard used in criminal proceedings to determine relevancy should apply to child protection proceedings. The nature of these proceedings have very serious consequences for parents and for their children and demand a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding. The purpose of our Civil Procedure Rules is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. To achieve this purpose, applicants must be clearly identified by providing the linkage between the information sought and the issues in dispute and must be collected by selecting means specifically tailored to produce the relevant information. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."

The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.

2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in 1992, Mabel placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of the plaintiff and the defendant, respectively, and in 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. After Mabel died in 1997, the plaintiff's wife, the mother of the four granddaughters, took the instructions home with her. The instructions were given to her in 1992. The following Sunday, Pennefather died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The trust was not validly created where there was a mere intention to create trust, or voluntary agreement to do so, and the settlor himself contemplates some further act for the purpose of giving it completion. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. HELD: 1)The instructions were never given to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not given any consideration to either Royal Trust or Royal Trust companies which would create an equity in her favour. 2)In the case of McIntyre v.

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had claimed damages for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing, the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. He argued that he could have sought out a skilled house cleaner prior to the hearing to consider the evidence.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. In addition, she requests that the court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father agreed, as part of the distribution of the family property between the parties, to assume responsibility for a capital gain on the real estate he was receiving at that time. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. There is, however, very clear evidence before the Court of the father that the current income is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of his 2008 income. It is clear on the evidence before this Court that the Father will not be able to support on an income of this size over the coming years. In light of the fact that the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father given his severance package, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in that sum when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income but the mother would be required to remit back to him the overpayment. 3) The severance is included as part the father’s income for 2009."

The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge at the hearing of the appeal was faced with conflicting affidavits. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the issues between them. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines is set aside. The appeal is dismissed. 1) The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7(1(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1) as well as in all other respects. 2) There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. 3) In all of the circumstances of this case, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right of lead evidence on any relevant issue and we must accordingly find that the judge made no error in this decision, supported by written reasons, that (a) the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the guidelines; (b) the applicant's income should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott had not a business based in the home."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the plaintiff obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. The defendant appealed the findings of the trial judge, who determined that s. 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. The trial judge further determined that, although the Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to s. 15of the Act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and the truth concerning attornsment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small claims Court Act."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to be joined as an amicus curiae, or as an intervener, pursuant to Rule 8.02. The Union opposed all of the applications advanced by the union, arguing that the trial judge erred in law in permitting the sole defendant(s) to stand as sole defendants in the proceeding, and in denying status to the union. The only other party that opposed the application was the Union's solicitor, who had obtained copies of documents from the prothonotary and was at the hearing hearing. Application to join as an interrupter was dismissed as well. Rule 62.35 was not relied upon by the Union. The court reviewed the history of interrupters and determined that they had jurisdiction to add a party for the purpose of launching an appeal, such authority arising from the provisions of the Judicature Act that incorporated the ancient practice of the High Court of Chancery in England."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent and [E.K.] but seeks the return of [C.S.] to her care. HELD: 1) The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial. He was served with the notice of the application and the Notice of Trial. 2) In the course of the trial, the respondent will consider the best interests of the child, the importance of continuity in the child's care and the possible effect on the child of delay in making a decision. 3) The children are 11 and 12 years of age. There was insufficient evidence to support a finding of schizophrenia or that of anti-social behaviour. 4) There was no evidence of neglect or abuse by the respondent in any of the circumstances described in this case. 5) The child did not have any contact with the respondent prior to being placed in the care of the Department."
c_2003skpc139.txt,"The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n). The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.","This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old when he appeared on the application. He had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence, which would be a relatively short period of time where the application was brought near the end of his sentence. HELD: The youth was ordered released pending a full hearing. The court was instructed to consider the merits of the application on a prima facie basis. There was no defect that was fatal to the decision regard remand or release pending the hearing. There are a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision and are to be taken rarely. However the test for continued custody does not appear too stringent as the court need only be satisfied on reasonable grounds of the governing criteria for continuation. There is also no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour. The young person had been convicted of assault, robbery, assault with a weapon and had served a portion of his youth sentence in community under supervision. There were no new offences committed while he was in custody."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to refuse to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees Union, Local 662, union and Attorney General had all raised concerns about the quality of housekeeping in the respondent's hotel. The respondent refused to employ the complainants because they were members of a trade union. The union alleged that the respondent was attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of trade union or participating in activities of union. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board for a rehearing. 1)The giving of reasons serves several purposes. First, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been considered that in the absence of a statutory requirement for reasons to be given, the decision-making process gives no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker, in fact, considers the applicant's submissions directly. 2)It is not sufficient for an individual to satisfy the Court that, within the range of discretion conferred upon the tribunal, it might or even would have reached a different conclusion. 3)Evidence relating to comment made by counsel for the respondent Union and to smiles or laughter on the part of some members of the Board did not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. While it may have been preferable if the Board had given reasons, it was not obligated to do so, and thus did not act in a procedurally unfair manner. 4)In recent years, with the development of a multitude of tribunals with varying degrees of protection from judicial review, it has become fashionable for such tribunal to give reasons. In many jurisdictions, the give of reasons is now required by statute. In Nova Scotia, that is reflected in the decision making process through three levels of immigration officials. The privative clause in the Act precluded the court from weighing the evidence and coming to its own conclusion on this issue. 5)In this case, the Court found that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decision and that in some cases, the reasons which it must give are not generally mandated. The Court canvassed the authorities to see the extent to which we have the power to quash the orders because no reasons were given."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as it did in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance. The Board misinterpreted the wording of the policy, which provided that an unmarried mother, pending the birth of her first child, could qualify for assistance if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support. The fact that the respondent's stepfather was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived was not evidence that she qualified as a person in need under the policy."
c_1999canlii12244.txt,"The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract. The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","The appellant appealed an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998 dismissing the motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent/plaintiff challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal in part and keeping the action moving, that the counterclaim is an independent action and it will take many months or longer before the plaintiff’s action is tried. There are a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action. The pleadings must be put in order."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. 2) In sexual assault cases, the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' is successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that at the time of the assault he was so intoxicated that he was not in conscious state and was incapable of forming any reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting. 3) In the case before me, the accused was found to be guilty of extreme drunkenness. He argued that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. He never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The Court reviewed the various cases and found that s. 33.1 may not survive the proportionality test in s. justification analysis.  4) The accused raised three potential defences. The first was that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the complainant did not consent to the sexual relationship. The second was that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the complainant's testimony, from which the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that she had not consented. It is difficult to understand how someone who renders themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The third defence was that of extreme intoxication. It was found in R. v. Daviault (1994), 138 C.R. (4th) 124 (Ont. C.A.) in which the court allowed an appeal from conviction and ordered a new trial. It did so on the basis that the trial judge failed to adequately consider the defence for honest but mistaken belief in consent by concluding that the person who exercises his right to walk along highway at night in dark clothing had no memory of those events."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applicant applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The picketing prohibition term of his release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. HELD: The application was denied. The existing order stood.
b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge on the return date granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given in the examination for discovery of Krake and ordered that the documents be produced in such a fashion as to be of sufficient interest to the plaintiff to a trial judge. The plaintiff also requested that the defendant's solicitor should be ordered to supply the plaintiff with specific answers to questions as to audit working patterns related to investments made by Saskatchewan Trust Company and the requisite part of the document referred to as'matters for attention of partners as at December 31, 1985'. HELD: 1)The defendant was required to answer certain questions outlined in the plaintiff's brief and during the argument that it was a party to the action, and to further amend the Amended Statement of Claim.  2)The plaintiff was also required to provide copies of the documents requested by the defendant in addition to any proper questions and proper questions arising from further and better production of documents by Coopers Lybrand (as may be ordered).  3)Costs of the action were awarded to the defendant."

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(b) and 10(c) had be infringed. HELD: The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. There was no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the sudden and unexplained seizure of his evidence. In the present case the accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel but was also put in contact with a lawyer working for Legal Aid."

The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff had sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought to have the injunction quashed.HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had a strong prima facie case and, in the circumstances, it would be inequitable to permit the landlord to rely on the failure to give written notice as required in the lease. There were no negotiations between REAL and the defendant. There was no promise on the part of REAL that it would follow up on these discussions, nor was there any discussion about exercising the option to renew either through the plaintiff or directly. The burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction is greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted lies on the defendant, who must be cautious where there is a serious question as to whether the plaintiff would ever succeed in the action."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash that investigation and to return the documents to the RCMP. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's. The Commission seeks leave to appeal. Its main argument on appeal is that the underlying judicial review application is improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made. There is no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. The issues raised on appeal are how to balance two competing requirements: the applicant's need to know and the investigators' need to keep secret; and the fact that the Commission is in the best position and has the statutory discretion to perform that balancing. The decision to release the information or not requires balancing of the competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and of the specific circumstances of the case."

The appellant contends that he was unaware that an accident had taken place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident took place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he didn't know had happened prior to returning from the Store. There was no palpable or overriding error.  1) The trial judge did give sufficient reasons for her decision and took into consideration all of the relevant evidence and the law in reaching her decision. She was entitled to assess credibility of the independent witness and the appellant, deciding to prefer the evidence of the independant witness to that of the appellant.  2) The court did not rely upon the testimony of any witness that was inherently improbable, and applied the correct burden of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, in reaching its verdict. 3) The verdict was not unreasonable (see R. v. B. (J.N.), 1991 CanLII 111 (SCC), [1991] S.C.R. 66, 71 Man.R.(2d) 156) and there was a palpable and overriding error (e.g. an error in law). 4) The evidence was so confused and contradictory that the judge could have given no articulable reason to preferred the contradictory evidence of [the independent witness] over the clear evidence of ( appellant)."

The children's extracurricular activities were to be suspended during two weeks of block holiday time (see Gordon v. Goertz). It was in the best interests of the children to remain in the respondent's care until the end of the school year.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006.

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for spousals and further agreed that a reduction in the applicant's income as a consequence was or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The agreement provided for annual adjustments based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband was a graduate professional engineer and was the founder and partner in an engineering firm. He had always earned a considerable income although he deposes to a number of substantial business investment losses in the United States. He maintained a pension with an asset value of $215,000 and house worth approximately $126,000. He married approximately two years ago. The fact it had now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application.

He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until June 15, 2002 with the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The issue was not plead in defence but in the framework of a summary trial. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and security interest. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of the pumper at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act. 2)Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, would the Court be able to ascertain the market value at the end of the Agreement in June 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair value in June, 2002 or equivalent to it, or more.  3)The agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest. The owner was to have possession and the unrestricted right to use his sprayer (provided that he did not exceed 500 base hours annually). The base hours were high and it was reasonably expected that the annual usage would be less than 1/2 of the base hours. The sprayer was used (not new) and the Agreement showed that new unit would sell for approximately $120,000, or approximately $25,000 more than the subject sprayer, and he had an option to acquire title by making the final termination value payment (the difference being $679.33 for 'principal' and $149.60 for 'past due interest'.

c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser for damages. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. There was nothing in her order or her reasons which indicated that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event. The Chambers judge's finding that the remedy of specific performance was not available did not constitute an adverse finding against the appellant on that issue."

d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's conclusion was supported by the facts. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample of his breath for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, and in excluding the evidence pursuant to s8, 8, or 10(b). The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn't make observations or truly act upon them. The video confirms that she was correct in most of those observations. The subjective element in determining whether a person has reasonable or probable grounds (e.g. to make a demand for a breath sample) is not present in the determination of whether the person had reasonable, probable, grounds to make the demand. Even excluding the slurred speech, which the officer had observed while she was in the police vehicle and in the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the other indicia of impairment referenced above, the remaining indicia provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and breach of his section 7 rights. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief that he was obliged to report the accident promptly. The officer abandoned his previous investigation and accompanied the accused to the emergency department where he stayed with him while the accused checked in and the officer observed symptoms of impairment and asked him how much he had to drink and was told that he had consumed. The police officer formed the opinion that the accused should ask the accused for a blood sample to determine the quantity of alcohol in his blood and the accused testified that he did so because he felt compelled to do so by his statutory obligation. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from evidence at trial. The evidence received, the statements in particular were self- incriminating and conscriptive. If the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave these statements, the admission would render the trial unfair. The statements were made in good faith and were believed to be made under compulsion of statute. However, they were not made with malicious intent or because the accused thought he was being followed up on by the excluded statements. It is not followed that any of the statements were in breach of the accused's s.7 rights. Even if they were, as the officer concluded, the accused responded to the officer that he knew his rights and understood the warning and the demand for a sample, none of these statements would have been necessary to exclude the evidence. The arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. The defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by a breach of a accused's section 7 right and were self incriminating, the exclusion of those statements would be more fair than a finding that the statements amounted to a violation of his right to a fair trial."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder of Mr. Byer was from the testimony of Ms. Saxon and her friend, Dwight Windrum. The defendant took the stand in his own defence and argued that a warning to both witnesses was mandatory, regardless of the defendant’s position at the time of trial. The appeal also centred on whether there was an error of law in failing to give the defendant a sufficient warning. The sentencing judge was also required to give guidance to the jury as to the acknowledged wisdom of looking for independent supporting evidence when the witness in question had a potential motive to lie under oath."

HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.

It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of a counterclaim which has the effect of facilitating disposition of all matters within one proceeding.  3)An order requiring security for cost will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against the defendant's counterclaim if the security is restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. 4)The presence of the counter claim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for costs. In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made. 539(c) should be exercised in the circumstances. 6)The defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which is the other action. That was the same subject matter and included all the parties involved in that accident. 7)A party counterclaim is not wholly distinct from the claim. There is a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff’s opportunity to defend the action. 8)Individual costs of the application were awarded."

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

The parties agreed that that was the appropriate course to follow.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years for a sexual assault where there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and claimed the property damage and vandalism had nothing to do with the offence. HELD: A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre was justified. 1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, the Court must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the Court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. The Court was not aware of any judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases. It was therefore of the view that given the seriousness of the offence, it would be contrary to the administration of justice to permit the accused, who appears to meet the requirements of s.786(a) and (b) of the Code. 2)The accused had no prior criminal record. He abstained from alcohol and stated he will never consume alcohol. 3)The sentence was increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. The accused was prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. The defence claimed the Crown failed to prove this assertion. 4)There were no mitigating factors and a sentence in the range of 3 years would be just and fair."

The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000.

HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the leasehold mortgage gave the appellant no enforceable rights against the respondent's fee simple interest, reasoning that the transfer of the fee simple title to the newly created surface parcel by the CPR effectively terminated the lease, leaving no interest to which the respondent could attach. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and the respondent, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent by virtue of the filing of its caveat. 2) The respondent obtained, under the provisions of the Land Titles Act, priority over the prior equitable interest of the appellant by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions. 3) On the basis of the above authorities, the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. 4) In this case the appellant's interest was an unregistered interest, but it did confer rights on the appellant and such rights were enforceable against him."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation.

The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

The victim, who had recently graduated from high school, was not exposed to family violence or the abuse of drugs or alcohol. The three accused admitted to the offence and gave a statement to the police shortly after his arrest. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. HELD: A four year sentence was appropriate with a slightly lesser sentence for Mr. Foster on the break and enter. The accused would face a sentence of one year to 18 months.

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The purpose of proceedings in the Family Division is not to 'find fault' or to 'right wrong'. It is to solve the problem (in case such as this where there are no children) of how to divide property and provide support to an entitled party after relationship has ended. This work is conducted in an environment that must recognize and assist a significant number of petitioners and respondents who are self represented. These cases suggest confidentiality order should only be granted when (a) the order is necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest in the context of litigation because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk; (b) the salutary effects of a confidentiality order, including the effects on the public's expectation and the public and social interest in this issue outweigh its deleterious effects, including that of the effect on rights of free speech and accessibility to open court proceedings. This is a case where the public has a legitimate interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft. The salutaries of a sealing order do outweigh their deletersious effects in these circumstances because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order."

Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicated it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. The one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term. 2) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in finding the tenancy is not a long term agreement and thereby committed an error of law.  3) The respondent gave written notice to the landlord to terminate the tenancy in September 2012 in which she advised she was terminating the tenancy and giving up possession of the premises on the 31st of October, 2012. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit. 4) The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month to monthly tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. 5) The 1 month notice provision referred to in the term of a lease was only applicable only in the context of the tenancy. 6) Counsel relied on the case of 10113307 Saskatchewan Ltd. v. Mattison, 2012 SKQB 22. It was therefore the appellant who had the obligation to show that he did whatever was reasonable to minimize his loss."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused, as a Treaty Indian fishing for sustenance/food was bound by the regulations, and if so, did the regulation violate his Treaty right to fish For sustenance or for food? HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence. The evidence presented was that the co-op decided who was eligible to purchase a commercial fishing license and that the closure of Jans Bay appeared to infringe on his right to sustenance fishing. The Agreed Statement of Facts was also granted on the basis that the wording of the regulation to apply only to commercial fishing and did not constitute a protection of Treaty rights. As the accused was a status member of the Canoe Lake Band, he was intimately familiar with the regulations and their impact on the area."

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The accused was charged with robbery. The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. His letter was direct evidence that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the accused. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary, preliminary and trial (eight months after the robbery) and to present him with a picture of the person he thought was the accused were the same person the accused sought to deceive and fabricate. 2)The letter was not an alibi. It was a direct admission by the accused to be honest and open that he did not intend to lie or to deceive. 3)The admissibility of the letter was high. The accused admitted that he lied to the police, the robbery was violent and the accused stole money from Domo Gas while armed with an offensive weapon. 4)The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate alibi by perjury. 5)The allegation that the accused intended to deceive or fabricate evidence was proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
5_2002skqb213.txt,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: a 36% interest in trucking company called 'Titan Transport Ltd.' The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The very duties her new partner was to perform were his duties. He is employed, but his income is not stated, he makes no apparent financial contribution to the household. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation.

e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. They had two children out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant nor the respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. Changes in the law of the marriage did not affect the right of the wife to seek support from her husband after divorce or separation. The right to spousal support arises only at the end of marriage. Before that, each spouse retains title to whatever property is in their name and they may freely dispose of it without the other spouse. For several decades after its adoption, all property owned by each spouse was considered to belong to the wife exclusively or to the husband exclusively, unless they had expressly obtained legal title together as co-owners of the property. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, was revealed to be inadequate at both practical and psychological level. The relief sought was an order reading into the definitions of spouse and common law spouse in the Act."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. Art and Laura opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. HELD: 1) The boys' continued placement with the MSS was determined to be an injustice. Where the Court is of the view that an adoption plan is unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances, it may make a long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until the Age of 18. It is clear that the Stevens family has a laissez-faire approach to sexuality. The fact that the children have special needs, even high needs, is confirmed by the Court's own assessment of the Stevens home. The Court found that the home met the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in it. 2) The Court ordered the permanent placement of the boys with the Ministry. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s.37(2)(a) of the Child and Family Services Act to be set out clear objectives. The children have been placed in this foster home for a period of time and will be adequately cared for by their parents for the duration of their stay in the home. There is no evidence that the boys will be able to cope with the pressures of living with their parents and they will be unable to provide for their children with adequate support and encouragement. There are a number of circumstances which could support an order for permanent placement. However, the best interests standard mandated by the Act is necessarily an individualistic approach as explained in A.C. v. Manitoba, 2009 SCC 30, at paras. 88-90. In this case, the Court was able to conclude that the parents' approach to their children was the one that led them to be placed in the foster home. It was also important to establish the criteria for placing the children with the SCC in such circumstances."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000 knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code; and for the purposes of trafficking having regard to the principles and objectives of sentencing. The accused had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug related offences. He had nine prior drug related convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; his pre-trial detention was in part the result of a failed preliminary hearing date which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. The amount of cash (almost $30,000.00) was found to be part of the proceeds of the trafficking."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At the time of the application, the petitioner was 13 years old and the respondent was in the primary care of her mother. The petitioner claimed that he was unemployed since the 1995 judgment and that he suffers from chronic depression and anxiety. HELD: The application was dismissed. Nothing had changed to warrant a variation. The material change in circumstances was not met. The existing access order allows the respondent to define the extent of access or time spent with each of her parents. There were no costs awarded. 1)The respondent and his wife were not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The fact that the respondent failed to file any income tax returns, notices of assessment or pay stubs or disability income stubs compels the Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. 2)There was no change in the material circumstances concerning the transfer of the property. There was no evidence that the transfer occurred because the bank was foreclosing its doors. 3)The petitioner was 15 years old. She should not be made to feel obligated to spend more time with her parents and should be able to go back to school. 4)In addition, the respondent should be aware that he is in the joint custody of the 15-year-old and that his responsibility to pay child support should be reduced to zero. 5)The Court dismissed the respondent's application to vary child support and arrears.  6)The present application is a twostep process as set out in the Divorce Act. The present application involves a variation of the 1995 custody order. The current access order provides for the respondent, who remains the custodial parent, to have access at all reasonable times having regard to his daughter's wishes and her school and activities schedule.  7)The mere passage of time, in this instance nine years, would constitute material change of circumstance relevant to custody. It is clear that the parties have not been able to continue to support a status quo which is in their best interests to continue."

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may, without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The application for dismissal is dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 to the defendants. 1)The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of the defendant's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence (QPRA). 2)There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach the conclusion on this critical issue.  3)The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non susuit. The plaintiff's argument is persuasive and must prevail. 4)The court was satisfied that there was no evidence upon which an expert evidence would be useful to assist the jury in the prospective deliberations and ultimate verdict in this case.  5)It is generally accepted that when doctor acts in accordance with recognized and respectable practice of the profession, he or she will not be found to be negligent. This is because courts do not ordinarily have the expertise to tell professionals that they are not behaving appropriately in their field. It is also well settled that the question of the standard of care that is applicable in professional negligence cases is a question of law and to that extent it is the trial judge's responsibility to articulate that standard as part of the judge's charge to the general public. The Court was also satisfied that the failure to call an available expert witness to testify at the original civil trial was the only thing that could have been considered by the jury as a sufficient evidence to support a finding of professional negligence by a jury. 5)The Court was awarded judgment against the defendants in the matter of Hagblom v. Henderson and Campbell (2003 SKCA 40). The case concerned the first threshold issue, which was whether there was any evidence, if left uncontradicted, to satisfy a reasonable person.  6)Costs of the trial were awarded to the plaintiffs. 7)The plaintiffs were given the opportunity to plead and/or call witnesses."

The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown had found sufficient indicia of reliability in all the circumstances to substitute for the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.  1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial. 2) The accused's character was examined as a further indicator of reliability.  3) The Court found that the test of reliability was met when the complainant recanted on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'. 4) In the case at hand, it was clear that the complainant was upset and she continued to cry throughout the time she was at the police station."

Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agreed that the proper court to determine the issue of access was the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General did not oppose the application. It merely sought a court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. HELD: 1) The applicant was entitled to make a copy and view the tape of the tape at its expense. It would like to do so at its own premises and own leisure. 2) The appropriate court would be the court of Queen’s Bench. 3) The presumption in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right was tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S., [2000] SJS, J.S.A. at para. 8, the right of access to judicial records has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is a presumption in favor of free public access but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. This is a right that was fostered by openness in our judicial system. McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 175. And Leader-Post v. Neuls, [1992] SJ. No. 686 (Q.B.). The presumption is in favour and the presumption to public access is supported by public access. The right to fair and balanced access is upheld by the principles of the governing principle, the Dominion of Saskatchewan, the Attorney General and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 4) In granting access to Saskatoon newspapers, the journalists were privileged to hear the audio and text summaries of more than 200 intercepted conversations that had been obtained by warrant.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The plaintiffs claim they owe the general contractor $6,292.54 for the repair work. The general contractor denies his workmanship was poor, that he was not allowed to finish the job or clean up the mess. Further, the plaintiffs claim for lost use of tools in the amount of $3,342.00. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant for damages in an amount ranging from $3.822 for the necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning to compensation for the lost used of tools. 2) In the circumstances, the counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. 3) In this case, while the defendant's conduct constituted breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed. The court found that the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim and there was sufficient relationship between the defendant and the plaintiffs to expect his actions, if careless, would likely cause loss to the plaintiff. 4) The plaintiff is awarded judgment for the cost to hire a contractor to redo some of the work, repair the damage and replace the drywall. The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 5) Awarding the plaintiff $580.00 for the damage done to the plaintiffs' home in relation to the countertop, that the damage is caused by the defendant not taking reasonable steps to fix the damage, but rather by taking reasonable time and care to complete the job."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. In light of the Crown’s decision not to proceed with the trial of the co-accused, who was convicted on a charge of defrauding ICC of money in excess of $1,000 contrary to ss. 380(1)(a) and s. 7 and 24(1), the Crown is not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. There was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the current indictment. It was more beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the judgment in the Schafer matter before proceeding with the Leibel trial. The Crown offered to consider an application to separate the indictment from the indictment if the accused could show that it was prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. The applicant opposed this application on the basis that it raised a question substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. but ordered that the Crown provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). The applicant argued that his agreement to waive any objections to delay until the outcome of the trial was known was given on the common understanding and expectation the Crown would carefully consider those findings and reassess its position in light of them, and, further, that it preferred to await the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada on that basis. It is common ground that the crown takes the position that it is more than bound by the conclusions of a trial judge with respect to certain matters but preferred to wait to hear from the Crown once they have been decided. In this case, the Crown did not have to rely on the evidence of another trial judge."
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada. [2] The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. Given their testimony, the application of the principles of W.(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] SCR 742) is a major element of this case. More detailed analysis of their evidence is required."

He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early April 1987, the project manager, who had been retained by the creditors, requested that the funds be disbursed to other creditors. He was also requested to obtain postponements of the mortgage advances he was required to pay on the next mortgage advance. The plaintiff sued him claiming negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiff's conduct throughout his retainer as solicitor for the project was one of conscientiousness and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients.

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code are summarized in this sentence: a global sentence of 15 years is appropriate in this case considering the multiple aggravating factors including the accused's serious criminal record including 55 previous convictions, 17 of which are for violent offences; the accused being subject to a firearm prohibition at the time of the offence; the fact that he was on mandatory firearm prohibition from the time he was arrested and was being transported from Waterhen to the Meadow Lake RCMP detachment to be served half of that sentence pursuant to the power of the court to delay parole;  2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter.

The accused was sentenced to 11 years less credit for his remand time of 7.5 years resulting in a net sentence of 11 years and months.  3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown is relying primarily upon three cases which it is relying upon in support of its request for a 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon has served one-half of his sentence. It is suggested that restorative programs may be available that could not be accessed if the Court made such an order."

Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the sole ground upon which the Information is based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (2) no reliance could have been placed thereon in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused applies for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The length of delay is 8.5 months. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8. 2) The Crown has conceded that it has been unable to meet the requirement to make timely disclosure. 3) The delay occasioned by the Crown's delay is 9 months. 4) The trial judge must be satisfied that the interest of society in requiring an accused to stand trial outweighs the interests of the accused in bringing the accused to trial. 5) In this case, the accused has suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges.  6) The accused has been extremely active politically. In 1996, he was elected chief of the Cote First Nation. He won by a tie-breaking vote. The validity of the election was challenged and he was unable to participate in the new election. The outstanding charges had clearly prevented him from maintaining his previously active participation in band politics. 7) The time period to be considered is the period from the charge to trial from the time of the commencement of the preliminary hearing to February 28, 2000. 8) There is still some material to be disclosed. It has to be organized at this stage and disclosed. There is a large volume of material that feel should be not only be disclosed but must be. It is the minimization of this prejudice that has been held to be the main purpose of the right under s. 11(b) of the charter to be established. 9) The prejudice has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The respondent is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. Romania seeks the respondent's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). The respondent states that he was detained by Canadian authorities for approximately 7 weeks during which time he made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In his refugee claim documents, he disclosed his criminal conviction and sentence in Romania. He was ultimately released from detention in 2004 on the strength of $5,000 cash and a surety bond. He is entitled to protection as a refugee under the Citizenship and Immigration Act and his rights of appeal in the country are exhausted. The Crown concedes that the respondent has met this low threshold and the Court therefore dismisses his application for an order of this Court releasing him from custody pending the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania. Romania opposes the extradition application. HELD: The respondent's application for interim judicial release is dismissed. 1) The respondent has failed to establish that his s. 43 submissions to the Minister are not frivolous. He has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. It is not common sense that the risk of non-appearance in extradition cases is higher in light of the fact the detainee does not wish to be returned to the country. 2) The Court takes issue with the respondent’s characterization of his sureties as being frivolous and that they do not provide an incentive to surrender him into custody given the risk posed."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.",The applicant wife sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children and an order prohibiting the husband from disposing of farm machinery and the 1994 crop. An interim order granted the wife exclusive possession of the parties' farm home with the exception of the tool shed and other parts of the farm yard which the husband was required to enter for the purpose of farming. Both parties were ordered to have no contact with the other. The husband had been earning money trucking and leasing out farm machinery for custom work on neighbouring farms. He had not paid most of the cost of producing the crop. HELD: The application was dismissed.  The court was not prepared to vary the order of May 27 and the extended order of October 19 which prevented the husbandfrom approaching the home quarter. The evidence presented by the wife was simply her assertion that her husband was earning money which enables him to pay periodic support. She was not informed of the unpaid expenses.

The applicant alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct. HELD: The application for leave is granted. There may well be some delay by allowing the third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984. It can hardly be said any additional delay, due to thirdparty proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cheaper and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless, (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to determine the issues on the motion, whereupon the judge shall order summary trial, or the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing.  3) The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed, but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absent of a cross- examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 4) In the case of a person who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer who stopped his vehicle was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle which was positioned directly in front of the police car at the time. The Crown suggested that the officer thought the vehicle could slow down and that the vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking the accused. The officer was acquitted of all charges. 2) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a stopped vehicle were careless. The police officer who had stopped to assist a person who had been injured in a store did so in good faith. There was no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to stop his vehicle. He was crossing a parking lot when he was struck. The pedestrian crossing road adjacent to the parking lot was a cross walk and the accused was crossing it when he entered the store. The defendant's vehicle had rolled forward only a short distance and not at a fast or accelerating speed. It is not clear how far the vehicle rolled or how long it was going. 3) The Court of Queen's Bench judge held that the accused drove careless. He could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close to him and had he not taken all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event, he may have been criticised for simply driving off."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge incorrectly decided the issue of indemnity when he engaged in determination of which insurer was obligated to defend the action and if so, whether the Chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the judge hearing the application may engage in, the duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. 2)The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 3)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application on a motorcycle policy arises when he ultimately rules there is no obligation to defending the action because the policy does not provide coverage for that which is alleged in the claim. 4)The Chambers judge clearly misinterpreted the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act. The fact that the question is arguable should not be conclusive. 5)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) application could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1)."

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 273(2)(c) of the Canada Act being Schedule B to the Charter. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 2)The accused's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept was not supported by the facts. 3)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was non-conscriptive and ought not to be excluded. 4)The respondent consented to have her private communications with the accused intercepted in order to assist the police in the investigation of the offences outlined below. 5)The trial judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. 6)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities. It concluded that there was no breach and the evidence was in fact admissible. 7)The breach was inadvertent and was not the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There was no evidence of bad faith, which could be considered by the Court that would have resulted in the admission of the evidence. 8)The intercept evidence was admissible and ought to be exclusioned. 9)It was reasonable and probable to conclude that the breach was not serious or inadvertent. 10)The absence of any evidence of manipulation would not affect the trial fairness. 11)Although the respondent was denied his right to choose his audience and in the course of that lawful intercept process, he was not compelled to make the statements that he made. 12)The affidavit was a transcript of the conversation.

It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The reliability threshold is not met, even if the witness was sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of the statement is false. 4)There simply was not enough solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit, to bring home to her the truth of her witnesses. The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the oath. 5)The evidence of the complainant was not present at the preliminary inquiry and there was no warning provided at that time of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 6)The affidavits were not administered post-sentence. 7)The statements were found to be consistent with the standard police cautions and the s. 8 standard police oath. 8)The affidavit was found to have been a substitute for the sworn oath as it did not provide sufficient corroboration for the credibility test and it was not relied upon to establish that the portions of the sworn statement which did not meet the threshold of reliability were unreliable.  8)Costs were awarded to the defence."

If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again.

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given that the presumption of care and control was rebutted, the trial judge next considered whether the accused had 'de facto control' as defined by Boudreault (2012 SKPC 129), [2012] SCR 157, and found that he did. 2) The trial judge found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the appellant did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as rebutting the statutory presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and was actively involved in the referendum process. He was a member of the Students' Union during the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation. When faced with a result (rendered by procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, he simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome."
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the breathalyzer readings and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the.08 charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. However, the trial judge found that the erratic driving pattern, his unsteadiness and fumbling, coupled with his admissions and odour of alcohol are matters which, if accepted by a properly instructed finder of facts, could have resulted in conviction. The accused's driving pattern may well have been combination of alcohol and a very hurting ankle but certainly some of the driving was result of his impairment. The only foundation for the conclusion of impairment articulated in his rather rambling reasons for judgment are references to beer consumption some hours earlier and '[t]he reading shows he is more than twice the legal limit.' The judge accepted that the accused's unsteadyiness could have been function of the hurt ankle. Consequently, the conditional stay becomes permanent and equivalent to an acquittal for both appeal purposes and autrefois acquit."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had not appealed. The issue on appeal was the interpretation adopted by the board of the word 'published' asused in s. 5(1)(b) of the Education and Health Tax Act. If, as the board found, the purchase of the documents was an independenttransaction, was it exempt from tax by virtue of s. 8(1(f)) of the Act? 1) The evidence before the board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase than documentation charges. 2) The respondent did not pay taxon what is referred to as Documentation charges. The alternative does not focus on the extent to which the book or technical paper is produced, distributed or available to sufficiently broad an audience. 3) On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding. 4) The Court's role is supervisory in nature. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On a case of fact the Court is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact made by the Board. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 5) The appeal is allowed. The decision of Board reversed. 6) The appellant shall have costs of the appeal."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The appeal was allowed orally. The court found that the trial judge erred in both ways. The trial judge did not refer to the actual threat, if any, faced by the accused and did not address the respondent's belief that he was being threatened; and the proportionality of his response. The appellant's mistake of fact was reasonable and he did not focus on the fact there were two officers present. It is not unreasonable for the appellant to believe that he is in imminent danger of death or grievous bodily harm and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. However, the appeal judge did err in the ways he did in failing to consider the factors of the three witnesses."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","This is an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J. F. LePage sitting as a Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the City was responsible for the discrimination against the applicant on the basis of his disability. CUPE had no claim to the right to be recalled into the position of permanent employee based on seniority. 2) The tribunal failed to take into account the applicant's disability. The fact that the applicant had Cerebral Palsy made his complaint within the Code's limitation period irrelevant. It was impossible for the applicant to gain employment with the City because of the entry-level position. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the Applicant. The tribunal was negligent in failing to find the City accommodated the Applicant adequately, reasonably and to the point of undue hardship. The Applicant's numerous attempts to gain permanent status were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and its administration for failing to provide him with employment insurance heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after him, passing him on the seniority list. 3) The Applicant had no standing to challenge the tribunal on any issue."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused, who was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance related to alcohol and weapon possession, was given his Charter rights. He was asked if he understood his right to have counsel then and there, and his response was that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day. The police had been aware that he had returned to the porch some time after 6:00 p.m. and that he, too, was in a state of shock. He went to the hospital, where he was treated for a head injury, and was released by ambulance. During the course of his detention, the accused made several incoherent ramblings about Paul McCartney but then turned to the accused and said, 'Is he dead? He beat me so beat him back.' The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he did not understand his rights. His response created enough uncertainty for the court to make a clarification such as, 'Brian, you have the right to counsel now before you make any statement to us'. It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. There was a low threshold in the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction."

The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive retroactive pay. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the agreement. The arbitrator found the phrase to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio that: 1) these competing aids to interpretation did not find an unambiguous one. The phrase referred to any employer in the context of the collective agreement, was an ambiguous one. However, the arbitrator used one of the appropriate and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase that is to interpret it in thecontext of the entire agreement. 2) The appeal was dismissed (orally) with the exception of the patently unreasonable error of law which was not a legal analysis but a fact of fact. 3) The entire agreement was subject to the Arbitrator's analysis and interpretation, and the phrase in question was ambiguous. It could have been any combination of tools, extrinsic evidence and the onus would have been a sufficient ratio to support his conclusion he was in error and patently unreasonably error. 4) The Arbitrator was unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history."

The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence. An application will be required by the petitioner to vary the access arrangements with the respondent.","The respondent sought an order prohibiting the petitioner from removing the child from Saskatchewan until she obtained a Court order allowing her to do so. The petitioner had two children from two prior relationships. Her daughter was presently 16 years old and her son, 10 years old, would be in February. The consent judgment provided that the respondent would have reasonable access to the child every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening and one week in each of July and August. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. Nothing in the judgment referred to above required the petitioner to obtain such an order. Even though the respondent had been advised, after numerous attempts, that there was no one in place to provide the counselling and treatment that the child required, the child had been seen by an education psychologist in Eastend."
4_1994canlii5226.txt,"The parties divided their matrimonial property in 1985 by agreement as confirmed in a consent order. The order provided that when the husband retired, the wife would receive, as her vested share of his pension, 40% of his benefit. The order also provided that the parties could apply for further directions as necessary. After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions. HELD: The wife is entitled to her share of the pension in any form permitted by the terms of the pension plan. She is also entitled to leave her interest in the pension to a named beneficiary, without reference to or the consent of the husband.","The parties married in 1952 and were divorced in 1984. Matrimonial property was settled by the parties in 1985. The university pension of the former wife was divided as follows: (a) the share vested in the applicant was not now in any way under the control of the applicant; (b) the university was to make monthly pension payments directly from the pension plan to the applicant. Whether this was converted to a lump sum payment or continues as monthly payments is exclusively the concern of the University of Regina and the applicant HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The court preferred to treat the application as one for an order interpreting the previous order and consequential declarations and directions. Paragraph 14(a) provides that the applicant is to receive 'a vested interest in the pension to the extent described in this order' which is the sum of $2,314.69 or 60% of the total pension payable. 2) The order of December 19, 1985 does not contemplate joint ownership or any implied right of survivorship. Accordingly, the 40% share, having vested in JeanZacharuk, is a share she may deal with without reference to,or the consent of, Russell. This order shall not be acted on until the expiration of 15 days and not then if there shall be an appeal."

She relied upon Civil Procedure Rules 15.07 and 15.08. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances. The proper remedy would be for the applicant to apply for a termination of the order under s. 48 of the Children and Family Services Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of a Family Court judge declining to rescind an order in 1993 for permanent care and custody of the appellant's granddaughter. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care, which envisaged that adoption plans would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the appellant had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. The husband reported the problem to the Agency, which sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The appellant sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules. Dismissing the application without costs, that the procedure adopted is an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of the past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her present circumstances. If the court is wrong in that regard, the court cannot find it is in S.'s best interest to issue a retroactive custody order under the Family Maintenance Act."
b_2001canlii2619.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving causing bodily harm. Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed a white vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at that time regarding the contact point between the driver's vehicle and the oncoming vehicle. HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person's ability to operate motor vehicle is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)It was assumed that the white vehicle was not speeding but it was coming into collision with oncoming traffic travelling in the proper lane and thus causing an accident. 2)The blood alcohol reading taken from the victim was accurately recorded as 216 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which was within the range of background interference for the test equipment.  3)Although the accused's condition may have affected her ability to drive, the initial reading of her blood alcohol level at 12:10 p.m. was accurate, as was the extrapolation of that reading back to the time of the operation of the motor vehicle in the same day.  4)The accused was found to have been inebriated. 5)The Court rejected the defence's submission that the hospital laboratory analysis was derived from blood serum rather than whole blood as there was no evidence at trial to prove the fact assumed.  6)The evidence did not support the admission of the expert's opinion as to the blood alcohol concentration in the victim's body."
3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the defendant, who did not appear at trial and entered a defence in defence of the allegations in the statement of claim. The issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1993 until February 11, 1994. HELD: The plaintiff's claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against the defendant was not proven and the portion of the claim dismissed. The defendant, Hyndman, was awarded taxable costs.  1)It was clear from the defendant's notes and the evidence at trial that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that the plaintiff might not be paid on the leases. 2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep the company operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money. The facts of this case did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)Costs. Although there was no specific contract regarding the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard in respect to some work orders that were issued by Redhead. Both parties were responsible for ensuring that the vehicles were operational. Both companies benefited.  4)The only evidence was that the payments by the defendant for work related to the repairs were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied by Hyno. The plaintiff was prepared to assume that risk.  5)There was no evidence of a breach of contract between the parties. There was no discussion about the contractual terms of the lease. No verbal agreement was made. It is clear from Cox's notes that the discussions covered the idea that the repairs would continue for as long as the trucks were in the possession of Standard or operating under the authority of the insurer. The evidence indicates that there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors of the payment of these accounts. In addition, all of the invoices marked unpaid and claimed at trial continued to be sent to the address for Standard at 417 Maxwell Crescent in Regina and there was evidence that these accounts were forwarded to the defendant.  6)The defendant was"

The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","The plaintiff sought damages for wrongful dismissal and damages for breach of contract and insubordination. HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He was awarded his taxable costs of the proceeding including all necessary disbursements reasonably incurred. 1)The plaintiff had been employed from year to year as a guidance counsellor. He taught upgrading and university entrance courses and supervised other teaching and support staff. His employment was terminated in the summer of 1996 when he was terminated by the chief and band council. He remained in that position until May 1997, at which time he was reinstated. His damages were limited to $12,394.22 and he was awarded pre-judgment interest on that amount. 2)There was no evidence that some members of the board created an environment that made it impossible for the plaintiff to perform his duties to their satisfaction. It was as though they were determined to see him gone and set about to find a way that he could not.  He was treated unfairly and wrongfully dismissed."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running a mixed grain and cattle operation. They have not settled a division of the matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is $29,983 and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn Knudson, born December 1998; in 2004, there will be added back income in the amount of $10,000 for non-subsidized childcare and any health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum. The Court is not prepared to add back to income in any of the three years the capital cost allowance is payable.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) Capital Cost allowance on personal property owned in the partnership. The analysis of add-back becomes appropriate only to the extent of $50 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished. 3) The Court will deal with the individual amounts on a year-by-year basis. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of trial, in fact, was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There was nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to conclude that the Capital Cost Allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed, that any expenses or accounting functions used by partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. Therefore, the Court was unable to find that the respondent has been making maintenance payments at an appropriate level for three years. The adjustment can be made at this time."

In admitting into evidence a statement by the appellant to an RCMP constable without holding a voir dire, the judge agreed with Crown's submission that the conversation should not be admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement. The RCMP had advised the appellant of several places that they should look for stolen lobsters based on information received from the appellant. The appellant advised the constable of axes used in the commission of the offence and told the officers that crates were in the ocean near the scene. The constable made notes of a conversation he had with the appellant respecting some of the circumstances surrounding the offence.

1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. All of this was very expensive. HELD: 1)The defendant was ordered to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if Siemens was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing byBawolin, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens is in fact, indebted to Bawol as he now says, at the time of the contempt. Such a turn of events would not excuse his disobedience of the court orders, but it might influence the trial judge on the matter of costs. 3)The judge might conclude that once the whole story is revealed, that the legal costs incurred to enforce production are out of proportion to any gain Siemens could have expected to achieve in the years since Siemens' acquisition of the company. 4)The court was satisfied that the defendant's contempt for the plaintiff arises from the sorry state of his records. The contempt has been purged sufficiently to permit the Court to withdraw from further intervention. Proper identification of assets has resulted largely through production orders against third parties, but also, through belated efforts by the defendant. Additional information demanded by Siemens can be obtained through the normal discovery process.  5)Solicitor and client costs to be taxed. 1)Immediately after the third party order was sought, there appeared to be an urgent need to preserve the plaintiff's property.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants' physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Department of Corrections declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus and these remedies fall outside the Exclusive jurisdiction of The Federal Court through a review process such as judicial review. 3) In the unique circumstances of this case, with the consent of both parties and the respondent not really taking issue with the applicant's request, the Court allowed the applicants to make submissions to the Court on their behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument the applicant had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated in the application. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants's situations have changed."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; in dealing with maintenance under the Divorce Act; the wife sought an order setting aside the separation agreement so that she could retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of the net proceeds if it were to be sold in the future; the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it was unconscionable and harsh to bind the wife to such a agreement. Both parties acknowledge that there are no factors that have been established under s 13 of the Act to warrant the creation of a division such as this; in fact there is no reference to independent legal advice in our statute. A divorce judgment is granted based on the finding that there was no possibility of a reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing. The wife's application for a share in the value of her Matrimonial Home (net equity) was dismissed. Husband and wife separation agreement set aside; maintenance to be increased in the amount of $1,000 per month; wife to pay monthly maintenance of $600; husband to pay child support of $800 per month until age 65; if the courts are not prepared to enforce the maintenance provisions of the contract they will make an order varying the terms of the agreement as the court sees fit."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable the issue will finally put an End to the Action.  1)The judge must be able to assess the conflicting opinions of the accident reconstruction experts as to how the accident itself occurred. Such evidence will be required to establish the origin and cause of the causation of the injuries. Such a determination will necessitate a re-examining of injuries and the evidence to be heard will be easily segregated and will not require repetition of the evidence. 2)A jury, after discharge, cannot be reconstituted. There was no evidence that such a jury could be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of the trial.  3)The plaintiff was not to be harassed at the instance of the defendant by series of trials, each trial taking issue on every link of the plaintiff's case. That is not the meaning of the rule as understand it, but it may properly be applied in such case as that have stated, where the judge has serious reason to believe the trial will end the action and cannot afford to delay it. 4)No jury, whether discharged or not, can be returned to carryon with the first part of a trial. The injuries sustained by the plaintiff are consistent with the causal relationship between the injuries sustained and the causal effect of the collision."
8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the difference between what the husband would normally pay to the wife and what she would otherwise pay for the children's support. The former wife operated her own business and earned negligible income. She asked the court to review the amount of child support paid by the husband, arguing that she was limited in what she could do due to an injury she suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident in November 2004. She sought to have the payments based on her RRSP income, which was a recurring income figure over the past four years, including 2008, be deducted as an adjustment pursuant to the Child Support Guidelines, and to have spousal support paid back to the date of the last order effective on any date before that date. The previous variation order was a consent order. Both parties agreed to its terms and both parties had legal advice prior to agreeing to it. The order was approved by the court and was not appealed. Under the circumstances, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that order or its terms in any event."

The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal. Dismissing the application, that the question is not whether the judge correctly verbalized the test, but rather if the evidence supported the committal, and there was, indeed, enough circumstantial evidence upon which a jury, properly instructed and acting reasonably in accordance with those instructions, could convict the accused of first degree murder.","This was an application by the applicant for an order in the nature of Habeas Corpus and an order for certiorari in aid thereof.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and possession of fish except in accordance with s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within s. 27 of The Act. The fact that the accused was prohibited from obtaining a fishing licence at the relevant times and from applying for or obtaining a licence by mistake did not disqualify him from applying. The Act does not give the accused the power to revoke or revoke the licence. Exhibit P1 is not a document valid on its face. It purports to revoke Mr. Paulsen’s licence and prohibit him from apply for or obtain a licence because of a specific conviction. It is signed by an unknown person. This is not collateral attack on a ministerial order, valid on it face. Nor was he served by registered mail, in which case it would take effect on the delivery date or on the date the signed post office receipt is returned to the sender."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge did not consider the definition of a weapon as set out in s.2 of the Code. HELD: Appeal allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed but that it was weapon as defined in the Code 2.0. That is question for the trial judge, considering all the circumstances. 2)The Court disagreed with the argument that there was no inference of the appellant's intent in having the concealed push dagger on his person might be drawn.

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti, in January 2007. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father in turn applied for variation of child support in September 2006. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The mother's poor treatment and disdain of the father and his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with him misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship.  2) The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship rarely stands alone as the sole ground for denying support unless the situation is extremely grave. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has been set at 1)."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide, on 'call out', repair services for Super Save. In the relationship, the defendant paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged to its detriment. The defendant properly points out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared, and that it has therefore incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 2) The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought, but the defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money sought. The plaintiff asks that the court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonably price for goods. 3) There is no evidence of detriment reliance. The law demands, that in the absence of an express term in a contract, or an implied term that the parties agreed to charge a fair or reasonable price for those goods and/or services, the parties agree to charge and pay a fair/reasonable price. There is only an assertion which has been denied by the defendant."" 4) It is clear that prior to November of 2015 the parties did not take issue with the invoicing. Some of the parties have given evidence that this is precisely because the defendant thought the prices were within the confines of the agreement that it signed off on. The Court cannot attribute the discounted price to the plaintiff. It would be unfair and unjust to allow the plaintiff, as it did in the first instance, to charge anything that is in excess of the amount it should have been charged, and in turn to deny the plaintiff that it is entitled to the quantum of damages it seeks."
c_1996canlii5370.txt,"This was an application by the defendants to set aside a default judgment entered against them by the plaintiff. Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during road work which had caused extensive damage to her property. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. The applicant submitted that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Application granted; the defendant had 90 days to file its defence. Although the Court could order otherwise, find the position of the defendant met the test for the Court to strike the default judgement under the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 12.06; and find the defendant did not have the jurisdiction to sign the order for default judgment. The default judgment should be set aside based on Rule 3.04 and the plaintiff was entitled to her costs of obtaining the default."
6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy under s.172(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. His assets were $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. His statement of affairs showed that he had $50,000 in assets at the time of his assignment, but that amount was reduced to $8,000 as a result of the combined forces of drought and BSE. The bankrupt argued that he purchased cattle for $1,000 per head prior to bankruptcy but could only sell them at his expense. He alleged that he sold cattle post-bankruptcy to save his farm. SCU brought an application to compel the bankrupt to consent to judgment on s.173(1)(a) and sought payment of the cost award of $12,000 coupled with a conditional order of consent of half of their judgment. The bankruptcy judge did not report on this ground and the bankrupt's demeanour was much the same as that of a bankrupt. HELD: The bankrupt's discharge was granted conditional upon payment of $10,250 composed of $2,250 for surplus income and a further $800 for payment to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. The Court found that this ground had been met and that the bankrupt should be able to comply with it within three years which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with such a condition. There was no question that his assets were less than.50 cents on the dollar when he commenced farming in 2001 and they had increased over the years. This ground was substantiated by SCU's expert evidence that showed the bankrupt was prone to errors in law and had made poor decisions in his farming operation but had made the right decisions in the right circumstances."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge did not specifically say that he considered these expenses to be extraordinary. He must have found one-half (i.e., five) of these extracurricular activities were ordinary, which means the respondent is expected to pay the cost of the ordinary activities out of her income, including the child support of $2,532.00 that she receives monthly. 2) The appellant appeals only this aspect of the fiat, arguing that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to pay proportionately to the costs associated with the children's activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses'. The only issue on this appeal is the order that the appellant pay 73% of Ashley's Tae Kwon Do and soccer costs, Mitchell's soccer costs and Makayla's voice and soccer. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products are priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. 3) The importance of a wage rise, retroactive and to a point where a rehearing would seem counter productive. 4) It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one. 5) To be patently unreasonable it must be clearly irrational, absurd, ridiculous so beyond the bounds of reason as to amount to a fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it. The Court found that the motion failed."
d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA prohibition order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIra compliance order which is mandatory in these circumstances. 1)The Court of Appeal reviewed the relevant case law and found the accused guilty of all four charges and that his order must be set aside and replaced by one of a lifetime quota compliance order for sexually assault offences. 2)The trial judge in Provincial Court agreed with the Crown appeal that the accused complied with the terms of the sentencing order but did not agree with the trial judge's interpretation of the second amendment to the Sex offender Registration Act."
8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act, [HELD:]. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and the consecutive sentences exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that, in addition to the usual fines of $500,000, the sentence was also demonstrably unfit. It was not an error of law that the convictions were so harsh as to be disproportionate to the offence committed; given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, this sentence was 'demonstrably unfit' to be imposed. Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit."

Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time. Working for CLC Logging Ltd. amounted to wage rate of $16 per hour for a six-week period averaging 34.25 hours. The average work week was 34.75 hours. 3) SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the respondent's gross yearly employment income at the time of the accident is much lower than that used for employment insurance benefits. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived. 4) The issue is determining the time that Montgrand would have actually been employed and that finding has been made."
6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the child have been resolved. The child is the biological son of the parties. He was born July 31, 1996 and lived with the mother until 2006, when he started living with the father again. The mother now sought child support for him from the father. This is an important decision. The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in a substantial substitution for that of a natural parent. This was not the case in Chartier v. Chartier (1999) Carswell Man 25 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada commented on the issue. Allowing the child to have contact with his biological parent was an important step."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On August 16, 2006, six days shy of the two year limitation period, the plaintiffs claimed that DDH, the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. HELD: The defendants are entitled to this information, at a minimum, before discovery. The defendants may require their own medical examinations by request to the plaintiff or court.  1) There is substantive and legitimate purpose served by the defendants' request for better and current particulars and disclosure of documents. 2) The defendants must know with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiff, the extent of her injury and whether there will be chronic disability the extent to which the plaintiff has not yet fully recovered for her injuries. There may be other reasons as to why the plaintiffs need more particulars in order to prepare for discovery.  3) The plaintiffs need to tap into the legitimate resources available to them. The medical opinions of the leading experts in their field are meaningful and can be interpreted to mean that they can assist in the discovery process. To be able to assist in that meaningful and meaningful way, they need more than just a request for particulars. These experts may also be of assistance to the plaintiffs in making further discoveries. These are real and meaningful resources that can be used to advance the defence. To tap into those resources is a legitimate and legitimate application."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.",The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent father pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether s. 7 expenses met the requirements set out in The Family Maintenance Act; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements for retroactive child support. The respondent father's contribution to the child's school expenses should be 59% being his proportionate share; and 4) if the respondent child continued to have independent needs he should pay his 59% share of those expenses within 10 days of receiving them.

The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. Deloitte & Touche applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the property obtained as a result of a year long effort by the applicant trustee to sell it. The mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the real property. Notice of this application was served upon counsel for the registered owner and no opposition on its part has been taken to this application. The application for the vesting orders applied for is granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions may issue. Because the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, R.R.S. 2000 combined with ss. 12 and 65 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c. L-5.1, and in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vestings orders, the jurisdiction formerly granted to the court by s. 87 of The Land Titlestles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new regulations. Rather, the court has reintroduced the provisions of s. 7 of the Act, which encumbrances, competing creditors, and the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted as there were no prior encumbrance, competing creditor, or survivor of the interest in the common equity rights (there was none) were adversely affected."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody of the children. Their access to the matrimonial home was largely divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Their desire to eventually relocate to Alberta to marry a speech language pathologist had resulted in the children residing an equal amount of time in each parent's home. Although their relationship was strained and they suffered from a lack of structure and support in their educational endeavours, the children were doing well in their father's home and it was in their best interests to remain in that home. The uncontradicted evidence of the mother indicated that the most important consideration for the children now was stability. That stability was found in their home and they received the most structured and support system in the province. The evidence showed that the move to Clareshorn, six hours drive from Saskatoon would have a significant impact on the children's quality of contract."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The deceased was employed at a grain terminal near Rosetown, Saskatchewan. He entered a grain receiving pit in the terminal, where he was engulfed in grain and died of suffocation. Viterra is charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of every person employed by it, including the deceased, was protected. The Court of Appeal does not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the Health and Safety of an employee. HELD: The deceased was not charged with any of the counts except for the one concerning the deceased. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The fact that the deceased had not yet received hands-on training in confined space did not directly affect the accuracy of the deceased's evidence.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The motor vehicle accident occurred in October 1998 and both Johansson and Johansson were paid their damages as result of the releases given to Citadel General Assurance Company (Citadel). Both parties brought a Statement of Claim on behalf of all three plaintiffs alleging that the motor Vehicle accident was caused by an inherent defect in the design and manufacture of the vehicle being used by the plaintiff. Both conditions were satisfied and the plaintiff was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel.

1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part.  1)The applicants spoke of the public interest, it appears to be intimately entwined with their personal self-interest. 2)The Town Council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. They held a tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. 3)In each instance the fact of the 'in camera' meeting was recorded and the Council's consequent action was made part of the Public Record. 4)There was a specific complaint of unfair advantage or discrimination by reason of the fact that the proposed hotel would be connected to the EverGreen Centre. The authorities were clear that the onus of proving these allegations rests upon the applicant. 5)Had the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting? The applicants were aggrieved that the Town Council conducted further business on May 25 and June 14, 1999 after the applicants had departed. It was the practice of the council to move to the Committee-of-the-Whole and then return to open session to complete its business. 6)The applicant sought to have the status quo declared null and void.  7)A public hearing was held on July 12, 1999 at which the applicants were excused from the council meeting and then returned to the meeting. The issues to be determined were: (a)whether the proceedings in respect to this proposed hotel was in the public best interest; (b)whether there was a breach of contract between the applicant and the developer; and (c)whether it was necessary for the applicant to obtain a deposit in trust in order to carry on negotiations with the developers on the proposed walkway.  8)The respondents were responsible for all legal, survey and service costs to the applicant, including legal and survey costs; and(b)to make a presentation for a new business venture in out (sic) town which will involve an existing public facility.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court's standard of review is that of whether s. 36 is justiciable per se, or whether the appellant's allegations against the government have merit. In this case, the claim must survive unless the court makes a finding that the government has breached its constitutional commitment to properly distribute this federal funding. The Court reviewed the applicable legal principles surrounding applications to strike and the heavy burden faced by the appellant as an applicant for an order to strike."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of fixed commission between the parties. The plaintiff retained a lawyer to help with the legal issues of the project.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan"

The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action as the case may be; (c) it is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and may otherwise be an abuse of process; (d) the plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to establish that. The statements made by the defendant, May Henderson, were malicious, highhanded and calculated to disparage the plaintiff in his profession, calling and trade carried on by him at the time they were made and to undermine his intention to seek an elected position as a member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff will have his costs fixed at $400 in any event of the cause. 1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant all the essential elements of a claim in defamatory are set out. That being so, a reasonable Cause of action is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. 2) The plaintiff must establish that the words spoken or written were published on lawful occasion, that is one 'fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency' such that there must be some mutuality of interest or duty between the publisher and recipient. This must be reciprocal of interest. It must not involve the satisfaction of some duty or interest which is unlawful or contrary to the public interest. The claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant. 3) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the plaintiff that the remarks were received in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. The Plaintiff fails to plead any facts as to the dates on which these statements were made thus depriving the Plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. The statement of claim alleges malice. It cannot be said that she fits within a situation like that in the Mitchell case."

A new trial was ordered. 1)A plaintiff should not be deprived of his day in court because of an institutional scheduling error which arose through no fault on the defendant's part. 2)A defendant in this situation should consent now to an Order directing a New Trial so as to allow the claim to proceed its merits. 3)The court appeared to have misunderstood the date and court room number of a note previously given to him by court staff indicating that the trial of his claim would take place on August 7, 1998. The date and Court room number were inverted on the note. A plaintiff in such circumstances has no recourse but to appeal to this court and incur the attendant expense to obtain the relief to which he is entitled."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other young men who joined the attack on the accused were also sentenced to probation. In this sentence, the Court imposed a two-year probation order. The Court also imposed a 10 year prohibition from possessing firearms following his release. The accused appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found that the accused was at a crossroads. He had some talent and some motivation to become a productive member of the community. 2)Pursuant to the principles of sentencing in crimes of violence, deterrence of the public was given the greatest emphasis. 3)The accused had a record of high levels of education and had been shunned by his peers and gang members for his poor grades. This was a case where it was clear that he had little chance of reintegration into society."
6_1993canlii4548.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for an alleged breach of a written contract or, in the alternative, damages for unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract of a written contract between the parties. The defendant, Nova, counterclaimed for damages based on negligent misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff. The defendants argued that the contract should be interpreted in a 'purposive' manner to give effect to the intention of the parties, notwithstanding that the 6' 15' sign was not strong enough to act as a free-standing sign. Nova refused to pay the plaintiff the sum of $875.00 per month, plus any provincial sales tax, less any deductions and copious amounts of monies paid. The alternative claim was that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation on the basis of unjust enrichment since it supplied a sign which had been used for the benefit of the defendants since May 1987. Dismissing the counterclaim without costs, that the evidence showed that the defendants did not misrepresentation."
7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union appealed. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 of the PPSA and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) and (16).Gari's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the regime established pursuant to the PPPA. HELD: The appeal was allowed. It was common ground that Gari was seeking security for possible damage caused by removal of the Building but was not seeking rent and reimbursement for taxes paid. The cross-appeal evidence that the building had been sold to a third party in the spring and was not removed from the property until the fall resulted in a determination that the Building was not properly removed. The plaintiff had not established its claim for damages until it had paid rent and received a security deposit. The court found that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to removal the Building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. As a result, Gari’s claims in this regard must fail.  1) The trial court reviewed the relevant statutes and found that s.36 of the Act does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. 2) The analysis of the positions of the parties must proceed on that same basis, i.e. on the same basis that, as of September 1, 2017, the building was removed, the site returned to its original state and the $3,500 security deposit returned to Gari. Gari paid a total of $6,227.88 in property taxes during the time period when it says the Building remained on the Property after it should have been removed. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town. 3) The Court reviewed the circumstances and found there was no evidence that Lakeland intended to seize the building unless it paid a specified amount for disposal. It did not establish that the"
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown argues that the learned trial judge relied on irrelevant evidence and failed to consider other more relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The appellant's driving actions, including the illegal U-turn, were found to be in violation of s. 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights. 2) The evidence from the arresting officer and the breathalyzer technician on the scene suggested that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that, in fact, he was impaired by alcohol. The officer testified that he had walked slowly but without stumbling and was unable to locate his documentation in the truck. The accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The court found that these otherwise normal driving actions do not negate the otherwise illegal driving, being the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The Crown sought an adjournment of the trial and an order for a new trial. During the trial, defence counsel disclosed to the court that the Crown had obtained instructions to allow them to continue reviewing the documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day because of the complexity of the documents, the number of documents available, the time it would take for the Crown to review the documents and, importantly, the disclosure of some of the previously disclosed documents. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue was to set aside the trial outright and allow the documents to remain undisclosed. As the court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that we are not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred because the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection. The defendant testified that he had just finished a police call in Cherry Brook and he had been requested by attending police officers to undergo breathalyser. The plaintiff also testified that she had had two White Russians during the evening that she thought were inoperatives of the vehicle's lights. At issue was whether the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. A.M.P. Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, Section 2, Section 3, Section 4, Section 5, Section 6, Section 7 and Section 8 of the Traffic Accident Investigation Manual. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1) The evidence of the accident reconstructionist convinced the defendant he was not qualified to express an opinion. The evidence from the plaintiff's lawyer convinced him that the defendant gave detailed evidence of where he was on the highway and finite details as to his speed at those locations. He found that evidence unrealistic. 2) The plaintiff did not see the police vehicle approaching the intersection when it turned right in front of her vehicle. There was a lapse of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 minutes between the time she heard the screech of tires until she reached the officer's vehicle.  3) The defendant was found to be contributory to the accident and the plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages she suffered."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife had been left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. Under the provisions of s. 22 of The Matrimonial Property Act, 1997, it was recognized that most often the young children of a broken home remain in the custody of the mother and so discretion was given to the judge to ameliorate the equal division regime which the registration imposed. HELD: The wife was awarded $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.00. The husband was given one-half of the matrimonial home valued at $8,358.00 and an accrual to a Standard Life policy during the same period of $2,200 for $890.00 plus an additional $4,445.00 for the home. The father was to claim an exemption for his own house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' property. Such a division would mean that the father was being given one half of the only asset the wife had during the marriage and he was to have to assume a large mortgage or move out of his modest $60,000 home or to a rental accommodation. Both parties had the benefit of the home during their marriage. The wife had no savings, no pension and had little financial problems. She was to be awarded the $25,000 or so that she claimed against the home under the Act. Although the wife's claim was inequitable and had she not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from his employment without notice in 1988 for his 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to a fifteen minute break for breakfast and an unpaid supper break for lunch. The defendant argued that the plaintiff's dismissal was justified because he failed to comply with company policy regarding breaks and overtime. Awarding the plaintiff $15.00 for an hour of work over an eight hour period, that day's break was $5.00 less an hour than normal and included breaks of 15 and 40 minutes. The plaintiff contended that his breaks were for his meal and he was awarded a $3.00 supper allowance. Dismissing the claim, that there was no reasonable excuse for the dismissal of the plaintiff. It was apparent from the evidence that the drivers and helpers had broken the rules by making the commutes to and from the warehouse, even though they were not paid at the time they were working. The fact that the breaks were often longer than they should have been and the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. On the evidence, the plaintiff testified that he stopped in at the Seabreeze Inn on most Thursdays when he did the Hubbards run and claimed overtime for the time he spent there. At his corrective interview in September, 1988, the driver and his helper were each given a 15 minute break in the morning and forty-five minute break during the afternoon. They claimed that they were entitled to breaks for lunch and that they had been given extra breaks for their breaks on the nights they were in the warehouse. As the plaintiff had not followed the company's rules, he was dismissed without notice. He claimed that his break was excessive and that he should have taken more breaks during the day. He also claimed that extra breaks were not included in his calculation for lunch break time. The only reasonable explanation given by the plaintiff was that he had been told by his supervisors that these breaks were part of his job. The Court did not find that reasonable explanation for his dismissal. On appeal the Court found that the defendant had satisfied the onus on the plaintiff to prove there was a just cause for him dismissal."
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The estate applied for solicitor and client costs out of the estate. The father sought party and party costs. The issues were not about the meaning of his mother's will but about the implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The issue was whether the father was required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of a condominium to his son. The central issue in the father's application was not about his father's Will but about his mother. It involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the Estate and the wills he drafted. Considering the present position of the father and his daughter, the three parties will bear their own costs. HELD: The representatives of the estates should be entitled to recover their solicitor, client and sues from the estate pursuant to the general practice and two principles.  1) The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to a client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of a successful party in the actual case. 2) In light of the present situation and the family's determination not to order costs against the father, those three parties WILL bear their costs.  3) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved a question about the value of the property, the question about its value, its use and the manner in which it was presented to the deceased. There was also an issue about the failure of the representatives of Mrs Hand's estate to provide an accounting. That was resolved only as the hearing began.  4) In respect to the father the estate will bear its own costs in light of this present position. The deceased clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the deceased before she executed the will. However, the issue was not between the father (who was represented in his personal claim by the father) and the deceased (who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting). The purpose is to give the successful a partial amount of indemnity from legal fees. Alternatively, the parties will pay their costs in their own capacity."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","The plaintiff claims his personal and professional reputation has been seriously damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. The plaintiff took four years post-graduate course in Illinois and received a Master of Science in 1984. In 1984, he started work at the University of Saskatchewan as an assistant professor. He received his full professorship in 1991. He was appointed director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) in 2002. During the long weekend, the part of the hospital was closed to the public. During and after the renovation to the building, the plaintiff kept a log of his work log from May 2005 to January 2006. It appears that the notice was posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace, by means of mass mailing to all members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and by posting on the CUPE website. HELD: The plaintiff has proven that he was defamed. The privilege extends to all communications made by high executive officers acting in the performance of their official duties relating to matters of state, such as the creation of a grievance procedure or an arbitration procedure. Counsel for the plaintiff is awarded costs. 1) The Court accepts the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. 2) There is no basis for jurisdictional defence. The words of the grievance were found to be highly impugned in the sense that they would tend to lower the plaintiff’s reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person and to the words in fact referred to the plaintiff. It is not necessary for the tribunal to have all the powers of an ordinary Court. The tort is one of strict liability. Jurisdiction is one in which strict liability prevails. The court found that the plaintiff had not only refused to prevent the harassment but had been an active participant and contributor to the harassment himself. 3) The plaintiff was found to have been defamed by the wording of the respondent in his grievance. The respondent was found not to have acted in a negligent or intentional manner in failing to prevent or to seek the assistance of the defendants in this matter. The claim was dismissed with costs. 4) The court accepted the defendants’ defence in qualified privilege on the basis that the respondent had not established jurisdiction as required by s. 16 of the Trade Union Act. The Court found that jurisdiction is not the only determinative factor in determining whether a claim has been made pursuant to s. 21 of the Act. It was also found in the Court of Appeal that jurisdiction does not lie with the respondent."

The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death. He was driving a motor vehicle that was operating in the manner dangerous to the public. The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive a vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his consumption of alcohol appeared to be a contributing factor. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. 1)A sentence in the lower end of the range is one which should be imposed and would be consistent with the principles of general deterrence, specific deterrence, denunciation, and rehabilitation. 2)The accused was prohibited from driving for 15 months. 3)Electronic monitoring would not maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.  4)The Court of Appeal was of the view that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants asked that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and sought an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 215(1) for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages and the issue of damages to be determined. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertained to the plaintiffs and the defendants' claim against them and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. The entitlement to sue for the disgorgement of profits hinges on whether Wolff, as its former employee, was in a position of fiduciary. The documents seized under the Anton Piller order had provided full disclosure to the plaintiff, and the plaintiffs would not seek any further order to restrain the defendants from competing with them. There was no evidence of breach of contract or improper interference by the defendants. The plaintiff's application to strike these portions of the claim was dismissed.  1)The defendants had developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This joint venture required confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain their confidentiality. 2)The plaintiff was not disadvantaged in her claim by allowing the defendants to withhold their work product at this stage because the plaintiffs already had an immediate remedy should the defendants poach their clients. It follows that the plaintiffs can easily discern if the defendants are breaching that order. No breach has been alleged."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court testified that it was common for persons accessing the centralized server model to access the same server, same Internet address, and obtain the same information from the same physical location. In contrast, the peer to peer system is much different set up. It would contact a network that would contact other peers, people that had files that they might want and they could share files from many different sources. The software can't put those pieces together. The result is that if two people, in the same house downloaded Shareaza on their separate computers, they would have different G.U.I.D. numbers on their installation. The court was satisfied that the accused had a very good understanding of how computers work. The first issue on appeal was whether the accused, who was at the residence following a night shift, could have changed his address so that he could access the address of the person he wanted to contact. HELD: The Court granted the application for a search warrant and authorized the search of the entire duplex located within the RCMP campground. There were three computers seized. One computer had three hard drives, three of which were non-password protected. Examination of his computer did not yield any child pornography. The second computer, which was a laptop computer, had been tampered with so that it could not be accessed without a password. The third computer, a desktop computer, and an external hard drive were all seized. During the course of the search, the accused was subject to numerous requests for change of his IP address. During his investigation, the Court was also required to determine the physical address and name of the subscriber because two hours later that would be when the search warrant was executed."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. The petitioner is a stay at home parent who worked casual shifts as an educational assistant. Following separation, the petitioner was making mortgage payments and paying utilities. In May 2012, he advised she would no longer contribute to the mortgage payment and would be reducing the child support payments to $926. He also indicated that he would reduce his utility payments. The respondent brought a motion returnable October 19, 2012 claiming child and spousal support together with exclusive possession of the family home. HELD: 1) The parties shall have joint custody of the children pursuant to a shared parenting arrangement. The parties agree that all outstanding issues are resolved at the settlement meeting. 2) The respondent seeks an order for interim exclusive possession (SSAG). The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. There is a need and ability to pay.  3) The Court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issue is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant applied for damages in a jury trial for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The trial judge awarded damages in the amount of $409,251.18. The defendant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)Since liability was admitted by the defendant the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. 2)The evidence of the past loss of income was so inordinately high that it is perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. 3)The plaintiff was not seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of this witness and to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries. She was on the evidence far from being totally disabled. Accordingly, she would not be able to continue to provide useful service as a nurse."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault claimed that the Youth Court judge erred in law in concluding that the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P. in March 1992 were voluntary statements. He appealed the convictions on two of the charges and a new trial was ordered on the basis that if the statements were not admissible, the Crown would have failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that they were voluntary. The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was a palpable and overriding error. The statement given to police officer was only admissible if it is a voluntary statement."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","The owner of a single family home applied for a variance to convert the existing use to a two unit dwelling so that it could have two units without changing the side yard requirements. The proposal failed and the owner was imprisoned for 10 days. The owner appealed the order and sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the court in the amount of $25,000. The fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution and the plaintiff was entitled to proceed with the taxation of its costs and disbursements. 1)The dwelling was in contravention of the Halifax Regional Municipality's Land Use By-laws. The Court found that the owner had intentionally failed to comply with the order by failing to disclose certain provisions of the Order. 2)The inspection revealed that the entire structure and building was only to be occupied as a single dwelling. 3)The door at the rear of the kitchen in the 'old house' connected the two dwelling units by a door. The door had no locking mechanism. The manner of payment of rental should be subject to the contractual determination between the landlord and any tenant. 4)The owner was to provide a copy of any lease signed by him prior to entry of occupation or any alternation in the lease or tenants to it. There was nothing in his Affidavit or the Affidavits of any of his tenants to indicate any concrete steps had been taken to rectify the situation. He may have told the students to remove the items of the 'partial kitchen' but nowhere was it suggested that they had been removed or that he had told them to remove them. 5)Random inspections were to be limited to twice a month with bi-monthly inspections to continue until the City was satisfied that the Order had been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff's officials would be entitled to inspect at random once a month while the owner of the property was the owner."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and Tenant and the operator of the Oshawa Group contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents? 2) Was the loss covered by insurance and whether insurance should have covered the damage; 3) Did estoppel apply? The arbitrator was not limited to the interpretation of the clauses of the lease. He could deal with the issue of insurance coverage and whether the amount of damages. The disputes were with respect to two sets of clauses: repair and loss of rental opportunity. The arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which did not provide that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes with regard to clauses or provisions. The decision to award damages was patently unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review was correctness and that it should be extended to the determination of the facts and to the effect of the legislation statutory tribunal is empowered to administer. The issue on appeal was whether this expanded scope of judicial review should apply to the awards of consensual arbitrators. HELD: The award would withstand judicial review.  1) It was the conduct of the parties that caused the error. They did not have jurisdiction to deal with it outside of their jurisdiction. The conduct of their employees and the manner in which they communicated to the other parties was beyond their jurisdiction to interfere with the award. 2) The arbitrators were not limited simply to interpreting the words in the lease and to giving the clauses an interpretation the language will reasonably bear. They were there in the commercial context and they were done expeditiously. 3) There was no breach of the tenants' rights by virtue of the use of the term arbitration. 4) In exercising their jurisdiction, an arbitrator must comply with the recognized tenets of procedural fairness. 5) The Court should only intervene if they find a genuine excess of jurisdiction by the arbitration clause, not simply where they disagree with his findings. The Court must look carefully at the decision. The decisions of arbitrators are often subject to judicial review outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In this case the Court was not satisfied that the standards of curial deference, and judicial restraint, applied to the decisions of a consensual arbitrator, but rather that they were broadly applicable and the Court could not ignore the fact that the agreement"
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The law firm's counsel had received confidential information from her clients during the course of her employment. The lawyer had advised the client that she would not discuss the files with anyone within the firm with whom she had worked for and that measures were being taken to ensure that no disclosure to any member of the new law firm of the former client's confidential information would occur. The client had not had any contact with anyone associated with the previous law firm concerning the Magnes and L. files nor had she had any knowledge of their existence. The evidence showed that all the screening measures, with the exception of the computer file segregation occurred prior to the client's arrival and that the instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. The court was satisfied that the screen was sufficient in the circumstances of this case and that there was not a risk of real mischief. There were numerous independently verifiable steps that the lawyer should have taken in order to ensure no disclosure of confidential information occurred."
e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a)) of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the officer was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer. The impact on the accused was also at the lower end of the spectrum. Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, demand for breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The more serious the Charter breach the more likely the Court will be to disassociate from that conduct by weighing in favour of exclusion."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's president did not examine his company's lease in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the applicant and her employees (which seems likely) and the employer were to ask the employer whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchisor. The adjudicator rejected the applicant's submission that the employer had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing the appellant from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. The employer then launched an appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as found by the appellant. His decision outlined some evidence upon which he could have arrived at his conclusions. Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some of the evidence upon Which He Could Have arrived at His conclusions.  2)It is not patently unreasonable to appeal on the basis of an essential event. An event which would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that contemplated by the agreement was not reasonably supported by the evidence. In this case, the event was not trivial. It was an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations. 3)In this case the employer acted reasonably in finding that the applicant had not frustrated or been inconsistent in the employment contract and thus had not fulfilled its obligations. The appeal based on the submission the employer erred in law by ruling that the employee had not been inconvenienced by the employer's conduct is dismissed."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, to appeal the interlocutory order of Justice Simon J. MacDonald refusing to appoint a court expert and refusing to order the appellant to answer certain interrogatories, the majority of which call for his opinion concerning the medical services provided by the respondent, another physician, to the appellant. The appellant argues that the chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that the appellant was a subsequently treating physician who had not previously treated a person such that he was required to answer interrogatories seeking to determine his opinion at the time he treated the appellant as to what would have happened to him if he had not treated him as he did. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part.  1)The appellant was correct in stating that CPR 19 does not state that a party witness can object to an interrogator on the basis of opinion. It is not sufficient for Dr. Miller to have objected to answer the balance of the interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion. This is dangerous because it may result in unreliable temporary opinions given by people without all of the relevant information. The safeguards provided in CPR 19.08 will not allow interrogatories to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, and would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  2)It would be unfair to allow interrogatory to usurper the function of an expert witness and to allow them to be used to obtain opinion evidence without the proper safeguards in place, such as the disclosure of expert opinion material, the fairness of the trial judge's preparation time, and the costs associated with such an application.  3)While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions, the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant, his counsel and the Court. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. In this case the appellant is entitled to have these questions answered, even if this requires the physician to disclose the opinions that went into the formation of his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant during this period of time. The physician is also required to provide the appellant with the names of three other urologists whose names were provided. These opinions relate to the treatment provided.  4)"
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The stated grounds of appeal were that the conviction was against the law, the evidence and the weight of the evidence; that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis, within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867, did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight; and that, given the evidence, it was unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, Sparrow, which was used in R. v. Grumbo and expanded in the subsequent authorities. The conclusion that night hunting with artificial lights, so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right was justifiable. The appellants had failed to show any error in law by applying the Sparrow test. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not necessary to set aside the decision on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The issue on this appeal was whether the regulations were a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether they were justifiable pursuant to Sparrow. 1)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights; the Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The trial judge did go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification. That is where the safety purpose of the legislation ought to be considered. 3)The evidence did not show that the accused Indians were Indians under s. 3 of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) but that they had moved to Meadow Lake and now only embark upon traditional Metis way of life during the summer months or other times when their children are not in school. 4)It was not proven that the people of Sapwagamik, who took the scrip in 1906, preferred as a community to hunt in the dark. The Aboriginal group was consulted. 5)It could not be said that the appellantants, like everyone else, were subject to the Saskatchewan regulation that prohibits night hunting by means of an artificial light. They were not seeking food or shelter on un"

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director allowing the Tenant the sum of $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation arising from what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide a premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord did not attend the hearing before the Director and it appears that she missed it inadvertently. The Tenant appeals. HELD: The damages are set at $862.50. The plaintiff's claim for general damages is dismissed. 1) The Court rejected the landlord's denial of liability. The Court found that the Director was essentially correct and that her discounting of the value of the furniture, $50 for the area rug and $100 for the clothing went a little too far. It was impossible to believe that the landlord, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. Having heard and assessed the plaintiff as credible, the Court could not believe that she would have engaged in such a tactics. 2) The damages were set a revised amount of $1,000,000. There was no credible evidence that the plaintiff's original belongings were ruined. The general damages estimate was based on four years of age, which could not be reconciled with the evidence of four or five years old. Jurisdiction was divided between two versions of the facts. The first version was more challenging, had the bylaw inspector's findings been independently confirmed. He detected mould and the conditions that allowed mould to develop. The second version was impossible because he could not have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The landlord testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the tenant used grey spray paint to resemble mould. The tenant spoke at length about what she regarded as the poor condition of the premises left by the tenant, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She wondered aloud why if there was mould that it only affected the tenant's furniture and area rug, and was not obvious on the other carpeting. This is a legitimate question which, while relevant, is not really answerable at this time. The two versions were as far apart as they could be. The applicant's task of choosing between these two would have been a little more challenging had I not been able and inclined to rely on the Bylaw Inspector's findings. He was able to detect mould and to detect the presence of mould in the premises."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, arguing that it was based on the deceased's gross income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision to the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The respondent's decision was set aside and the estate was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the Death Benefit to her as a surviving spouse and her two dependent children in accordance with the directions of this Court. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days, payable every 14 days.  2)The only income replacement benefit available to the surviving spouse in s.146(1) was $500 per week until the date of her death. The death benefit was one-half the 'income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 4. The meaning of this payment was that the payment was made to the survivor on a weekly basis."

HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender which was awarded to another tenderer who had less experience in the area and got favourable reports. The Plaintiff sued for damages. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)An implied term of the contract is that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenderers fairly and not give any of them an unfair advantage over the others. 2)Curniski used reliable independent sources for his information. The tender package contained the usual privilege clause: The lowest, or any tender need not be accepted by the defendant. This clause does not entitle the defendant to disregard its obligation to treat the tender system and no tenders to accept. 3)Cuziski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  4)Had it been an event of fact, the plaintiff would have been more successful. The unfavourable report on the plaintiff's planes doomed the tender. It now appears that the plaintiff compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor. A fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation.  5)The plaintiff was treated fairly and opposed to its loss of a tender.  6)Costs usually follow the result, but this was an appropriate case to exercise discretion to disallow costs to the successful party."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children were to reside with the mother H.H. and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he proposes to address his own addiction problems. 1) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that the children be returned to him in his care. 2) The father was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both children were the subject of a consent order for six months on October 2, 2007. Both the mother and the father were in care for most of their lives. The permanency committee had explored resources with the Indian Band, A.A. and Narcotics Anonymous once per week. The parents had weekly two hour supervised visits with the social service worker. The evidence showed that the mother was often late for parenting classes, sometimes late for one or both parenting sessions and sometimes late at night. The father indicated that he was not looking forward to going to bed at night because he was afraid of the attention of the Ministry staff. 3) The evidence did not support the father's position on the Harm Reduction Methadone Program notes but the father proposed that he would continue living with the Mother while she first attended anger management class and took anger management courses and he would first attend a parenting class and provide all drug screen results. The mother supported the father on the grounds that he had failed to provide proper programming to the children and that he should continue to live with his mother while he was at the Ministry.  4) H. H. was the mother of two children born in October 2005 and was nearly four years old at the time of this hearing. The two children have been in the care of the Minister for Social Services for the past 12 months and H.O.S. was apprehended at birth as was the father. Both of the parents have had children of their own since they were born. Although the father has had a substantial criminal record, the mother has been on the methadone program for some time and the evidence shows that the father had not followed through with his programming. The issues with the evidence and the parents' failure to follow through with their probation and parole conditions are complex and the"

He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece.

The Crown now applies for third recognition. HELD: The accused is granted a security deposit of $1,000.00.  1) The Court found that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP officer in charge of the High Risk Offender Response Unit and Ms. Woytiuk, that R.N.S. will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that the accused be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 2) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions. He entered the criminal justice system at a young age. He continued to re-offend and became entrenched there. There was no de-escalation in the violence, drugs and alcohol he suffered while incarcerated. There were no less than 20 failures to comply with lawful court orders. The three escapes from lawful custody are important as they provide an insight to the accused's degree of impulsivity and inability to telegraph his behaviour. The accused's security risks can either be downgraded or upgraded based upon his actions while in prison. There is a reasonably grounded fear of serious and imminent danger which must be proved on a balance of probabilities."

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. She is also alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. The defendant denies the allegations. HELD: The statement of claim was dismissed. The Court held that it did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. 1)There was no causal connection between the defendant, Dow Chemical, and the plaintiff's damages. Rather, the pleadings portray nothing more than a relationship akin to that of vicarious liability between the defendants, the Dow Chemical Company and one of the other defendants, namely, Dowcorning Corporation. 2)The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. As result, that defendant cannot be served with the Statement of Claim within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. 3)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages both in contract and tort. The statements of claim do not disclose an actionable wrong on the part of the defendant. It is argued that such a relationship exists because of the relationship such as an employer, employee, or principal agent. 4)The Court was asked to assume jurisdiction in respect to the claim as it relates to the defendant in Saskatchewan under Queen's Bench Rule 31(1)(f) and following what was stated in Moran v. Pyle National (1975) S.C.R. 393. This Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary, although any uncertainty or doubt is to be resolved in favour of the corporate defendant."

The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery.","The applicant power company applied for summary judgment against the defendant's supplier of coal under a Coal Supply Agreement.

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the ground that the judge either overlooked or failed to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give credit to the appellant for his one-half share of them.  1)It was common ground in the trial judge's discretion to adjust the value of the matrimonial property based on 20.4 months of future earnings. If the severance pay is additional remuneration given as a reward for past service, it should be shareable to the extent that it is attributable to past service during the existence of the marital relationship. 2)The court was unable to find any basis upon which to change the disposition.  3)The judgment was expressly approved by the Court of Appeal as applicable to all such cases, the result was well within his discretionary power and was reasonable result. 4)The appellant was acquitted of all charges."

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws). The claim also seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'low sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they have made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling 'Low the Low Sodium' beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no higher or appreciably lowers in sodium, and that the plaintiffs' argument set out in their brief has no factual basis. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted.  1)The Court was comfortable with following this judicial authority and determining the defendants’ summary judgment application prior to having to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification. There was no genuine issue for trial and the expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was uncontroverted. 2)It is common practice to place a lot of weight on the evidence of others. The Court would be open to the possibility of other representative plaintiffs to come forward by issuing a new claim under the class action act. 3)While there may be a genuine issue requiring trial in a class action context, the Court would not require it to be tried in a conventional trial. In this case, the facts were undisputed. Consumers would expect a product from others in the line as being meanfully [sic] higher in sodium. The messaging was not that it was low, and so are other similar products, but that it is meanfully lower. 4)There was no evidence to support the assertion that the defendants had misrepresented their product. The Facts were undisputable. The evidence did not rest on the assertion by the defendants that the products were low-sodium and that they did not intend to be 'low- sodium'. The evidence was consistent with what the Court had heard in other class actions cases. 5)It would be possible for the Court to order summary judgment in favour of the claim, but only after the certification hearing had been set."

This provision was fundamental element in the contract.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence.

Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The Crown appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional. The proper method of analysis in this case has three steps. First, it is necessary to determine the matter, or the 'pith and substance' of each of the federal and provincial laws. As for the federal legislation, it has been assumed by both parties that it is in pith and Substance criminal law as decided in relation to its predecessor statute by majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in RJR-Macdonald Inc. v.

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent was charged with failing a breath test. The stop was part of a spot check program (R.I.D.E.) whose principal aim is to detect, deter and reduce impaired driving. The officer asked to see the appellant's driver's licence and proof of insurance and found that there was nothing improper about his driving. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser and gave him a breath sample without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The respondent refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. At trial, the RCMP officer testified that he was stopped because he thought the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The trial judge concluded that the stop was justified because it was urgent that the breath sample be obtained quickly in order to be effective. She found that s. 119 of the Alberta Highway Traffic Act, which authorizes police officers to stop vehicles, to require the driver to surrender his licence on demand, to 'bring his vehicle to a stop and furnish any information respecting the driver and vehicle that the peace officer requires'. The Crown appeal dismissed.  1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It was clear from the cases that when the execution of these general duties involves interference with a person's liberty or property, the powers of a police officer are not unlimited. The use of the word 'forthwith', that is immediately, and at the same time require the defendant to be subject to detention which is sufficiently lengthy to provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. Once vehicle comes to a halt, further authorization must be sought elsewhere in the Act. An impaired driver is a potentially lethal hazard that must be detected and removed from the road as quickly as possible. The ability to administer the test immediately helps to protect the public by detecting those who may be danger. The more accurate breath sample will correct the ALERT error. 2)The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyszer demand.

The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the Court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault and whether she should have been convicted of assault causing bodily harm.

As far back as the case of R. v. Lepaski, [1989] S.C.R. 844, the Court spoke of the intent required for various assault provisions. The accused was convicted of mischief.

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard.

The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.

He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds. He deposited the money into his CIBC Visa account and the next day withdrew $13,000 from the account. The next day, he deposited another cheque into his bank account and withdrew $20,000 in cash. This time, the money was lost by the bank. A Provincial Court judge granted a conditional discharge with a probation order of 1 year and a requirement of 200 hours of community service work and a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The accused had no criminal record and asked that a conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 100 hours ofcommunity service work. The Crown appealed the conditional sentence. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of the conditional discharge. A 12 month conditional sentence is ordered with a 1 year probation order and a 2 year restitution order. In R. v. Elsharawy (1997), the Court of Appeal for Newfoundland commented on the prerequisites to valid discharge. The conditional discharge is granted only if that disposition is both in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest. The Court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and a 200 hour community service requirement. The restitution order will remain in place."
e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a year to year lease in which they were allowed to increase the rent on three months written notice. The landlord refused on the grounds that the increase was not for the benefit of the tenants. A Residential Tenancies Board hearing was held on July 10, 1990 and rendered its decision without costs to the parties. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the decision of the Board and the decision and order set aside by the court, that the interpretation of the Act, the Rent Review Act and the Standard Form of Lease is clear. The tenants only gave three months notice of the increase. The Board did not interpret these provisions as granting the landlord the right to demand an increase in rent in the middle of the term. The notice must come at least three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. The board could not say that the standard form of lease really provides a rent increase, since neither the time nor amount are specified."
d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement to be constructed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and sought rectification. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for rectification was dismissed. The court cannot accept the plaintiff's version of events.  1) The defendant knew the price of the RTM did not come with a basement. It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the basement. 2) The plaintiff is entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on $1,716.28.  3) The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the Court was not satisfied that there was an agreement reached."
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant failed to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka.  2) The application for an injunction restraining the respondents from soliciting, contacting, making contact with or providing service on equipment that was sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc. (Danka); 3) Injunctive relief until trial was necessary to protect Danka against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience not being enough; and 4) The Court found that the respondent had put at least some of its former employees on notice of what its expectations were with respect to confidentiality and competition. These employees took with them proprietary and confidential information which will then be used by them and Brennan to further erode Danka's market share and solicit its clientele."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office have rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded in March 2015. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The length of time between the appointment of a bill for assessment and the actual payment is outside of the 30 day time period provided by the Act. There are accounts outstanding that have not been paid in full, totaling $53,059.71. 2) The information put forward here on a substantial number of files should be much more specific. The information presented is not from her own direct observations and conflicts with the evidence provided from sources who had the opportunity to directly observe. It is not sufficient to make a general complaint that the services seem to represent a large sum and expect the same things to thereafter be scrutinized in detail. 3) The notion of 'block billings arising in argument and not being based on concerns expressed by the applicant is problematic. It attempts, in essence, to assess an ongoing relationship rather than the provision of services on a particular matter. A review of the recent case law highlights a number of factors that judges have used to determine whether to abridge the time for applications to assess legal bills. The requirements set out in the Act are considerably less stringent in the present legislation than it was in the replaced legislation. The applicant is entitled to rely on the evidence put forward."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a social worker as a witness. She testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in allowing such evidence and treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of the social worker was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After consideration of the entire record, it was concluded that it did not."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant plead guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000 contrary to s.334 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate. The appellant had received no useful information about his past or present substance use. The evidence did not show a significant change in the appellant since his release on bail. It was not in society's interest for the appellant to be removed from his present positive environment and placed in custody."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The issue was whether the parties had cohabitated for more than 90 days and whether this constituted a breach of their agreement to live separate and apart. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was between the parties and that they would not cohabit for longer than 90 day periods. The respondent was evasive, argumentative and untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. JUDGMENT: 1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave for the cohabitation; 2) The untrue statements set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as to his residency; and 3) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. The petitioner swore the parties cohabited for ten days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until June 30, 1997. The Respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitations extended from June 30 1997 until September 18. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the co-habitation would have extended for at least 95 days. The appellant was awarded costs of the trial in the amount of $10,000."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner and from his solicitors in relation to the respondent's claim in Queen's Bench Action No. 2270/97 pending the petitioner's application or further court order;(b)restricts the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive; and(d)restrorbs the respondent with the costs of any application or hearing pending his application or any court order.HELD: The respondent's personal claim for damages in the Action is the only asset that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that has been made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children. This $40,000 figure is purely arbitrary and either party may at any time apply to raise or lower it based on evidence available at the time of such application. 1)It was not satisfied that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order were identical to those that must be considered in an application for an interlocutory injunction. 2)The respondent had failed to meet the tests set out in The Interpretation Act. The legislature had apparently determined that the protection of dependants outweighs an individual's rights in property. The strength of the plaintiff's case, whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted, versus the probability of harm to the defendant if it is granted.

2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. She sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. The husband had previously filed an application for consolidation so that one hearing would be possible. The wife's application sought to strike or amend the husband’s application for child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement was that the wife had agreed to pay child support based on the information contained in the loan agreement. There was no evidence that this agreement had materially changed since the date of the loans. It was also clear that neither the wife nor the husband treated these obligations as child support and that neither of them declared it as income. The applicant had not been required to pay any of the outstanding debts. The indemnity agreement may be something that could be relied on as a promise made to the wife in the event that she was called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The parties had entered into an agreement that the loans would be repaid in full by the wife. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the retroactive order."
6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: In this application, one of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. The grounds asserted by the applicant are that the defendant did not have testamentary capacity at the time of making his Will. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made out a genuine issue for trial to establish the 2013 will in solemn Form. The Court reviewed the authorities and found that the threshold for the challenge was reasonably low. 2) There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on the defendant. It is presumed that the testator knew the contents of the will, freely approved of those contents and possessed the necessary testamentaries to the Will in question. However, the presumption, short-lived, may affect the ability of the propounder to rely on the presumption. 3) The test in Quaintance is, as is the general statement of the issue to be determined in Dieno, based in the context of jurisprudence respecting the wishes of testator and validity of will. In this case, the test is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to meet the tests contemplated within the procedural framework. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of the defendant's estate and its history with respect to its five adult daughters. It was found that, in contrast to the present day, the defendant had been very emotional and appeared to be unable to deal with the concerns raised by the daughter particularly regarding her lack of mental capacity. 5) The defendant's conduct during the visits at the nursing home and at the hospital was of little or no importance to the Court as the issues were complex and did not accord with the standard of proof set out in the Ritchie judgment. The defendant had not shown sufficient initiative on the part of the Court to challenge the will in such a fashion as to require trial."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006. His assistance was terminated in May 2006 due to failure to disclose requested information. He re-applied for income assistance in May 2007. His application was again denied on the ground that he failed to provide requested information as to his income. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was heard by the Assistance Board on September 6, 2007. The Department refused to cooperate with the application board and the applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $750.00 exclusive of disbursements. The Applicant intended to appeal the Board's decision based on non-disclosure. However, the Department was provided further information in October 2007 and the application was not reinstated until June 2007. If the applicant had the right to ignore decisions of the Appeal Board, the appeal board's function would be meaningless, as the Board had clearly stated in its decision to grant the application. In Dewolf v. Rent Review Commission (1982), 56 N.S.R. (2d) 403(N.S.)T.D.) where the court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Board enforced. There was also a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and a duty owed must not be discretionary in nature but may be established either at common law or statute. The board so erred that it could not properly exercise its judicial functions under the Act in making determination of whether the DeWolf's were 'persons in need' under the Social Assistance Act. Even if it meant in this case complete refusal and rejection of the appellant's decision, the Court would have to order the appellant to implement the Appeal board's decision."

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta.

The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the applicant's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the Statement of Claim to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. There are good policy reasons in support of the conclusion that a victim who is a witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. However, this is not the case in every case. The plaintiff bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the appellant, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in the proceeding. He bears the cross-examination and cross-examining evidence which is presented throughout the proceeding to prove his self- defence.  3) In Sagon v. Royal Bank of Canada et al (1992), 1992 CanLII 8287 (SK QB), 89 Sask R. 16 (Q.B.) Grotsky J. wrote at p. 24. A verdict in a Criminal trial is in admissible as proof of the party's failure to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. 4) In Montgomery v. Black, [1989] B.C.J. No. 1800 QL Melvin J. faced a similar circumstance. He relied on s12 and 14 of the Partnership Act. The outcome in each proceeding is irrelevant since the parties, issues, and proof are somewhat different. One who is convicted of a criminal assault is not immune from later civil action for the damages resulting from that assault but he will be excused from paying punitive damages to his victim."
d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","The Police Review Board conducted a hearing de novo and reached the same conclusion as the investigating officer regarding the complainant's 'guilt' of the alleged misconduct, specifically that she had permission of the Chief of the Police to attend a meeting. The Board found that the complainant had not given permission for her to be present at the meeting and that the penalty imposed was a reprimand. The applicant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the Board's decision to not refer to what the Review Board considered a 'proper' offense in the original complaint was a technical defect only and did not materially affect the procedural fairness of the proceedings."
4_1994canlii3885.txt,"The Respondents contracted with the Department to care for a child and his Mother who was mentally disabled. After two years, the relationship between the Respondents and the Mother broke down and she left their home. The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child. The Mother appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the respondent. The mother was placed with the appellant and the respondent [M.H.] and the child was placed solely with the respondent (A.H.). The relationship between the mother and the children broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The appellant further contends the trial judge misconstrued important evidence and misinterpreted important facts. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access by the mother. 1)The trial judge was correct in his statement of the law that his duty was to determine what custodial arrangement was in the child's best interest. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in clause (i) of s.8. The trial judge's error as to the categorization of the appellant as needing level care when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist, as to concerns about the mother's ability to care for the child and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time. 2)The respondent cross-appealed for costs on the Queen's Bench tariff on trial below and on double Column on appeal."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is ordered for a total of eight months. There is no dispute that the applicant and the respondent cohabited for in excess of 2 years. However, the fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. The fact that the respondent and the petitioner cohabitated for some time and that the petitioner is a'spouse' by virtue of the Act means that she is entitled to interim spousals in the amount of $20,000, however given the short-term relationship and given the issues resolved sooner rather than later, these payments should be paid. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make interim child support orders in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. It is now clear that the Court can make interim orders in this case in relation to family property in favor of the applicant. 2)The fact that this Court may order person to provide maintenance for his or her child, in accordance with need, is somewhat cloudy. During the course of the chambers hearing, counsel for the petitioner further refined her request to an interim distribution of $2,349. This is the amount that counsel for Ms. McPhail holds in trust after certain property was sold. It was never contemplated that the items sold would be of significant value to the petitioner. The respondent, at this interim stage, ought not be responsible for paying child support and, if so, an indirect way to claim child support from her."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits. The sole issue on appeal was whether these extra dependant benefits payable under the Act were payable in the amount of $47,427.00 being the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3). The deceased's children were entitled to such benefits as was the case here with the exception of the youngest child, who was not attending school."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

The defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of the plaintiff for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. The question posed was whether there was any right of privilege as between 609 and Henry; if so, how is it claimed and are such documents privileged as between the Plaintiff and Defendants? Who is responsible for the cost of production of any documents? HELD: 1) As a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. These questions, together with the disparate positions taken by the participants in their written submissions, demonstrate confusion and misunderstanding as to the nature of the act and consequently of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action.  2) Questions 3 and 4, and the first branch of fall to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as an 'information to be searched' by the RCMP. The applicant alleged that these documents were found at his place of business, located in his and Ms. Taylor's residence, and in any storage facilities occupied by the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant's own evidence supports the inference that he would not have pursued a warrant without the paragraphs 20-23 in the Information. Unless real bias can be shown, such prior contact is not sufficient to raise an appearance of bias. The issues were as follows: 1) There were no court proceedings under the Divorce Act or the Matrimonial Property Act.  2) The interactions between the applicant and the lawyer giving rise to reasonable apprehension of bias are too indirect or inconsequential to raise the issue of bias; and 3) The respondent was more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the Court was satisfied that the respondent's evidence supported the inference, which he should not have taken for granted."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant was not entitled to any more than nominal damages. The court erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. As the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal, the employment contract had not terminated until after they had secured the contract for their own benefit. The employer has not abandoned its duty of good faith. The Court of Appeal held that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although the plaintiff gave notice that she would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, she was still employed at the time she made her proposal.

In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio.

Such inconvenience as was suffered during the year following the accident will be adequately compensated. 3)The plaintiff shall have her costs taxed."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent was entitled to child support in the amount of $181 per month. The Court was not prepared to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts."

The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who believed there were dead tuna in a tuna pen. He used diving equipment borrowed from the defendant and another individual who was not present on the day of the accident. After a medical examination, it was determined that he died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. The court found that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the defendant's boat and that the others were his crew members. The defendant had a profit-sharing agreement pursuant to which 10% of the gross was paid to the defendant, 10% to the plaintiff and 26% to Harnish as boat share. After expenses, the net profits would be divided equally among the four. The plaintiff was not entitled to any kind of authority over the other fishers."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a large tractor and farm machinery. Over a period of time, the farm machinery was purchased and the sale proceeds were used to purchase the acreage. HELD: The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the amount of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action. 1) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. 2) The respondent claims that he owned several machines prior to the marriage. Over the years he has owned mostly machinery of significant value. However, when consider the testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, it is my conclusion that the father is the actual owner of the tractor. He is not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. 3) The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court will not take them into account. 4) There is a claim for $16,500 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. The petitioner can hardly be heard to say he owes money for it. However the legislation does not permit such in the circumstances of this case. 5) The father is entitled to register a judgment as charge against the family home."

There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their 3-year-old son, and awarded child support to the appellant of $2,726 per month. The appellant appeals only portions of the interim order relating to spousals and exclusive possession. HELD: The application to lift a stay of proceeding is allowed. It is understood that the purpose of lifting a stay is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiced simply by appealing."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree in Accounting. She spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. She suffered a miscarriage while in the marriage. She sought a lump sum or periodic term of maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she could become financially independent. The respondent denied entitlement. Allowing the application and awarding the sum of $100 per month interim maintenance, that there was some causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to obtain a new motor vehicle and the fact that she did not upgrade herself as a result of her marriage.

After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and the co-owner, Sandra Klarenbach, did not participate in the hearing. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. See Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. v. Gozanski, et al, (1994) for example.  1) The registered owners have had ample since their separation to resolve their family property dispute. The foreclosure proceedings have been in progress for six months. The registered owner believes that it can be sold in four to six weeks for between $124,000 and $125,000 if shown to prospective buyers. This is not the proper forum to attempt to effect a family property settlement. 2) The application is dismissed. 3) Border Credit is entitled to apply for a final order of foreclosure. Any further delay that does not result in sale and payment of the mortgage in full, will result in lost security value for the Credit Union. 4) The applicant is not entitled, in these proceedings, to a possession order."

The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","The applicant sought an interim injunction until trial or until a further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. An interim injunction was granted until further order. 1)The applicant raised a substantial question to be tried. The Court established a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect or anapprehension of injury. It has shown that the defendants in doing that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights are doing so in a manner which is in breach of that right. 2)The balance of convenience in the matter favours the applicant. The applications were granted. They were granted in the amount of $1,000.00. 3)Interim injunctions were granted against the defendants and any person acting under their instruction or behest or members of said Unions. 4)An interim order was granted in respect of the unlawful picketing which had occurred at various of the applicant's premises, places of operation and work sites."

The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. The Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 on the drugs and the respondent valued the drugs at slightly under $2000. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. However, the sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the Act. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was “offence property” within the meaning of the Act and whether it is proportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission and the criminal record of the person charged or convicted. The trial judge found that “basically all of the money” to pay for the truck came from the parents’ bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. 2) The truck was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The judge was satisfied he was relatively young and had no prior record. The father was depressed and remorseful. 3) The sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with the sentence imposed. 4) There is nothing turning on the failure to give notice as the parents were fully aware of the proceedings and their interests were dealt with by the judge although he was wrong in his decision. This section allows innocent parties who have valid interest in the property to apply for an order of forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that it had correctly decided that compensable gradual onset stress required that there have been work-related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive viewed objectively, that is, in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The issue was whether the Policy was wrong to take this approach and if not, whether WCAT applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. WCAT did not err by considering whether stressors experienced by the worker had been unusual or excessive on an objective basis in the sense required under the Policy. This reflects the law which was in place before 2005. The Board exercised its policy-making authority to bring clarity to these issues. The Policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The only issue which arose was whether gradual onset trauma was compensable as a result of the policy. The Court reviewed the state of the law at the Tribunal level and found that GECA reflects the present state of our law. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having accepted that there were 'unusual or excessive' workplace stressors in the workplace, and faced with the evidence of a 'personal conflict and ineffective management' evidence supporting a causal link between those stressors and his stress injury, she failed to draw that causal link. There is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The question is whether the policy applied the correct legal test in light of the evidence in this record (the issue raised by the second and third grounds of appeal) is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. This is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick."

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood; and having been found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat to engage the emergency brake and turn off the engine. The accused testified that he did not intend to drive the vehicle. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence.  1) The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80 might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2) The only issue on which requested briefs from the Crown and Defence was whether or not the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time."

During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago.

HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. 1)Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b)to be informed of that right; and (c)to have the validity of the detention determined by way of habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful. 2)In R. v. Ryland, 2010 SCC 36 (CanLII), the accused alleged a breach of his rights to counsel of choice under s. 10(b). As well, he had claimed that his rights under the Charter against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained had been breached. 3)The Court reviewed the relevant authorities and found that at no point was there evidence that there was a waiver of the right to reasonable opportunity. The officer had no involvement with the accused in respect to the issue of choice of counsel and ensuring the accused had ample time for that to occur because that would normally be the duty of the officer. 4)The self-incriminating evidence against the accused was excluded from the evidence in accord with s. 24 of the Charter. The police must provide the detainee with reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The detainee is in the control of the police and he cannot exercise the right unless the police provide him with a reasonably opportunity to do so. 5)The officer has a duty not to request an accused to provide samples of his breath unless and until the police officer has obtained a clear and unequivocal waiver from the accused that he is aware of all his rights and no longer wishes to contact counsel. In the absence of that duty the Court must determine whether the Crown met any onus on it to establish that the accused waived his rights."
e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss253(b) and 255(1), and driving while disqualified contrary so s 259(4), all of Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and at all material times. There was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the impugned conduct."

Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005. The Trustee was appointed as trustee in bankruptcy. During the trustee's stay of proceedings, the Trustee discovered that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. The trustee refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. Pricewaterhouse retained Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors. When he attended at the premises, he found that there was a rental of the premises to Mr. Muller personally and no lease agreement was made. He instructed his staff to remove the inventory to another location and they began to carry out their instructions before the trustee arrived. HELD: The application for summary judgment was continued.  1)There was no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the claim or the defence. The mere statement by the defendant that that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issues issue exists. 2)County Realty Limited was entitled to summary judgment. 3)The Court was satisfied that the plaintiff had established a bona fide issue and that his claim was supported by the evidence of County Realty Ltd. employees. 4)Costs were to be determined on the basis of the determination by the Court of Appeal as to the amount of costs."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.",The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay at 6 percent per annum. 1)Had the plaintiff made continuing and diligent efforts to find employment, she would have been awarded damages in the amount of $924,000.00. 2)Had there been any doubt as to the nature of the employer's proposal, there was no doubt that the plaintiff had been rebutted by the employer. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of the proposed changes. There was no question that the employer put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept. No doubt the employer wanted to get rid of the plaintiff. However, no reasonable person would have thought that such a proposal was insulting, an insult or degrading to an employee of six years whom the defendant had acknowledged merited the highest recommendation. 4)No reasonable person could have expected that the six month notice period offered by the defendant in relation to the length of employment would be extended to eight months.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000 and were married in 2001. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the parties' relationship was traditional, the father had abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. The result was that the father was not entitled to the child tax benefits and had been overpaid. It is important to give the child a consistent source of income so that they can transition easily between homes. 2) The father has bounced from home to home. The boys receive minimal direction or discipline. There are three bedrooms in the basement one for Damion, one for Seth and one for Johnathan. There is a further bedroom in the master bedroom. The parties' home continues to be under renovation and occupied by the father. Despite his physical injuries, he is assisting with the renovations. He will plead not guilty to all charges, including driving over.08. 3) The parties had an agreement that the parties would continue to receive the Child Tax Credit and child support but that the payments would be based on 90 per cent of the father's income. There were no boarders at the present time."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: 1) The original order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years he earned an average of $55,120 per annum. This actual situation does constitute material change. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then he has avoided paying anything for a considerable period of time. In light of his recalcitrant approach to his support obligation, neither the passage of time nor the quantum of the arrearars should deter him from the fact he's avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and his former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place. 3) The Court must accept the original Order was correct and it was not made in 2005. It must then determine whether it should be varied retroactively to impute a different, albeit lower, income that was said to have been earned by the respondent. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is unclear why he discontinued any interest in this invention, but it appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, or otherwise to continue to earn an income. It appears he has had little ability to continue with the manufacture of the invention. While this recognition is of assistance, it is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent, who is now earning $88,808.88 per year. The children have each attended post-secondary education. The Court therefore determined that the payor has the ability to pay. The Arrears from 2013 to date will be adjusted to accord with the income as found by the Court for the reasons stated in Trang Trang, 2013 ONSC 1980 (2d Supp) 364, and there will be no variation of the order"

The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law.

The procedure to be followed in dealing with an application for adducing fresh evidence should be as established in [1988] S.C.R. 480. 1) The fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in [1980] SCC. The same rule should apply with respect to an order refusing to terminate an order for permanent care and custody. 2) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases. 3) On special grounds inspect or view any place or thing."

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she sought exclusion of evidence or a mistrial. Mistrial ordered. The accused was relieved from her previous agreements and undertakings regarding trial process, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence at trial. She was entitled to re-elect. There was no mistrial and the accused was acquitted. The court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence and that she had been prejudiced. The new evidence can be used by the Crown to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. There is no suggestion Crown disclosure is incomplete. The complainant made significant decisions regarding the conduct of her defence during her re-election process that affected her credibility. She made important tactical decisions on the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements to elect trial by judge and jury and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. This would frustrate the truth-seeking function of the court when Crown non-disclosure was inadvertent. This is an important case because it could lead to the creation of new evidence which could be used to discredit the accused’S credibility. A mistrial would be unfair to the Crown because the new evidence would go to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and would affect her ability to defend her rights."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure.

The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act.

Specifically that they had not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in the legislation. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs of the action. 1) The legislation requires an unconditional and unequivocal commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance a purchase of land. 2) In Saskatchewan farm land context, the commitment to finance referred to in the Act means mortgage financing for the vast majority of persons who would be seeking to exercise right of First refusal. To interpret the letter of commitment as a declaration in the act in a manner that would exclude mortgagefinancing, would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of refusal. 3) It is against the grain that most farmers who have recently experienced difficult financial circumstances, for the simple reason that banks do not issue letters of credit unless they are already secured or satisfied that the person on whose letter is to be issued is good for the money on an unsecured basis."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in (1) failing to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused's subjective foresight of death could found a conviction; (2) instructing the jury they could return a first degree murder conviction on the basis of s.231(5) of the Criminal Code; and (3) failing to give adequate instructions on the defence of drunkenness. The court also found errors in the jury selection process.","This was an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder. The trial judge's instruction to the jury contained several serious errors, the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother seeks sole custody, allowing her to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The medical examiners did not meet the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. The doctor's opinion was based upon the knowledge that the plaintiff was impaled on an iron fence for approximately 25 minutes and that the injury was a 'through and through' wound. 2)The plaintiff did not reveal any of the possible signs of infection or of what to look for if infection set in. 3)The pain and suffering was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in the manner prescribed by the medical doctors. The medical evidence showed that antibiotics should have been prescribed, the plaintiff should have seen his family doctor the next day, and the would should not have been closed. 4)On the totality of the evidence, it was clear that the subsequent infection was caused, in part, by the injuries themselves. The defendants failed to take the necessary steps to best manage the wound. The plaintiff suffered from mild to moderate pain and significant scarring, which was the direct result of the injury. 5)Although the medical reports and the discharge advice were adequate, the real fault lies with the plaintiff who, for whatever reason, failed to reveal fully what had happened to him. He was not negligent in not giving adequate instructions."
2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff set at $1,000. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $4,000 that he paid to the defendant. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. However, the defendant simply forgot about the discussion and the work was done. 2) The plaintiff was liable to pay for all extras which he requested. He was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. 3) Costs of Performance were to be preferred as the measure of damages, but reasonableness may require a different approach including diminution of value. The Court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to any of the extras and dismissed the claim against him."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant had the care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The appellant's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with, then it applies equally to when he was first observed in the vehicle as to later observed in it. Clearly impairment of ability to drive is an issue of fact to be found on all the evidence before the Court and must satisfy the Court beyond reasonable doubt. The inference made by the trial judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with."
6_2004skca168.txt,The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,"The appellant appeals from an order which directed that the daughter of the parties attend kindergarten during the seven week period before trial. The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. The respondent's motion under Rule 15 is now moot. Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party. The real issue is where the child will attend kindergarten. Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. Commencing in January 2005, the child shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon. The move to Saskatoon will affect the terms of the final order with regard to the parenting issue. Danelle's primary residence and where she will attend school will need to be resolved prior to her entering Grade 1. That is a matter that should be left to the trial judge. Applying a discretionary power, fact that serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal, is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The will was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reached the age of twenty-one years. The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month in order to preserve the farmlands in specie for conveyance to the children at age twenty one. The Executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act but the petitioner's new spouse applied for a reduction in the amount owing on the farm machinery, grain and livestock expenses. HELD: The maintenance was to be varied annually from $250 per month to $500 per month. Pursuant to an order of February 25, 1991 granting corollary relief in divorce proceedings the child would be entitled to share equally with his brother, Bruce, in the estate. 1)Personal effects were physical chattels having some personal connection with the deceased such as articles of personal or domestic use or ornaments, clothing, furniture or other assets related to the business oroperations of the farm.  2)The term 'personal effects' did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery or equipment or other immovable assets.  3)The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. These calculations were only crude estimation but had attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate could reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the Testator's intentions to preserve farmlands for their age."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittals of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and had admitted in their evidence at trial that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets, that the only aboriginal right the Court should consider was an aboriginal right to fish for food. The respondents were Metis and reside at reasonably isolated Metis community named Turnor Lake. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 of the Constitution Act, 1867 along with the Rupert's Land and North Western Territory Order passed in s. 146 and s. 35. The accused offered a constitutional defence based on the evidence of his clients, Elders of the Metis, who had conducted interviews with number of people in the area, and expert evidence from Professor Frank Tough, Associate Professor of Native Studies at the University of University of Saskatchewan. The defence counsel for the accused served notice of the constitutional question they intended to raise on behalf of the accused on the Attorney General. The notice identified their aboriginal right as protected under the Constitution of Canada and included references to s. 91(24) and 146 of theConstitutional Act. In issue was commercial fishing. It was open to the defence to attempt to establish that their clients have an Aboriginal right to Fish for Commercial purposes as opposed to fishing for food only. HELD: It was the proper characterization of the aboriginal right one of fishing for commercial purposes because the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purpose. The appeal on this point is limited to the argument that such a right was extinguished (appeal ground 4). It is the defence's prerogative to argue the case on the basis of the Aboriginal right that is in issue. 1) Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. The facts at trial clearly established that your clients intended to sell any fish that they caught at Moberly Lake or Fox Lake. Therefore, the fishing is a valid aboriginal right. 2) The Crown at no time intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion. 3) It is not necessary for the Crown to prove anything"

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer.

1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The appellant argued that the American Cyanamid test was not applicable and that it was against the interest of other members of the Association to allow a person, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of penalty. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. He appealed the decision of the I.D.A.'s disciplinary panel. Application for interim injunction granted; the appeal Division found that the applicant would not have satisfied the requirements for a interim injunction in the circumstances described in the application for the interim injunction; the Court of Appeal did not permit the application to proceed in any fashion other than in very special circumstances. The applicant's medical evidence was flimsy and it was premature to say at this stage that the respondent would not receive a fair hearing under the Constitution."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and cocaine and a knapsack with a large amount of cash. At a subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale and a black wallet were found in the accused's car and he was driving erratically. The accused was a student the previous year and was unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source. The police had found a backpack stuffed with cocaine and cash which the accused had placed at his feet in the back of his car. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of all three charges before the court.  1) The Court accepted the uncontroverted expert evidence that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine were found at the street value of $100 and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the purposes of trafficking and so find. Possession of property obtained by crime (Criminal Code s. 4(3)) The evidence was circumstantial, which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from was that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. 2) The Crown did not call evidence, but argued that this was an admissible case in which the Court could not draw a direct inference from the evidence to draw a reasonable inference. The Court was satisfied that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 were in his possession and that, because they were in small denominations, found on the same bag as large amounts and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was not present on the wharf at the time of the investigation they were seized knowing that they were obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. 3) The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused. The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt (as it did in this case) that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it. It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. 4) The accused is guilty of the following charges: personal, where a person has something"
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The defendant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the defendant or to the plaintiff. The defendant denied living in the basement and denied being a seller of methamphetamine. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The defendant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who, indeed, represents him before the Court. 2) The evidence of the plaintiff and her friend fails the test for admission for slightly different reasons. The Court is aware that the appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. No notice was given to the Crown of the application for fresh evidence and the original notice of appeal did not make reference to the possibility of an Application to Adduce Fresh Evidence. 3) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos, who was a fellow methamphetamine user, she does not swear that the defendant was selling methamphetamine on April 17, 2003, the date when the offence was alleged to have been committed. She was in the open portion of the basement of the duplex and did not give him a place to stay. There being no new evidence, the Court would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems."

The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

A solicitor for the applicant took the position that no solicitor-client relationship existed and, therefore, Chapters IV and of the Code of Professional Conduct have no application. No solicitor client relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm in 1995. Its interests were then adverse to those of Lois Hudson who had her own lawyer. Whatever documents delivered to his lawyer in 1995 were not needed to support his legal proceedings. They were sent to Lois Hudson's lawyer. The fact that the applicant now supports his wife in her defence of the action brought by the plaintiffs does not, in my opinion, change the situation that existed in 1995HELD: There was no solicitor client confidentiality and no fiduciary duty resulting from the acceptance by the applicant of documents from her. Whatever duty was owed by her was to the applicant. Lois was not required to take any action or to refrain from doing anything. Neither was the lawyer a party to the action. No breach of confidentiality occurred or a conflict of interests arose as contemplated by Chapters III and V of the CofP Conduct. To extend the confidentiality of solicitor client relationships to the circumstances of this case would, in the view, lead to unreasonable results."

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was 3 years of age. The third child (R.M.) was born in 1997 and lived with the mother and her grandparents until December 2001, when the Agency services were terminated. The Agency continued to visit the children and in January 2001, the Agency provided transport and money to secure the child's diaper rash lotion and product. In February 2001, two of the children separated again. The police made a referral to Children's Aid when N.D. was expecting her second child. There is no more information on this referral. It appeared to be based on caution, given the actual cause of K.D.'s death was never determined. All four children have been in temporary care with the Agency since December 2001. A further child (O.D.) has been placed in the supervised care of the Agency. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency conducted a summary or discussion based on all of the findings. In April 2003, a Child Abuse Test was conducted and the results of the Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test were published. In May 2002, a Family Skills Worker was appointed as expert witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. The child had a slight five code type. This code type is relatively infrequent and occurs more in women than men. These individuals are very comfortable with themselves and their behavior. As consequence they report mainly emotional distress and are relatively free of any disabling anxieties or guilt. They are in good physical health. They report they do not abuse substances. It is unclear when one looks under the heading, 'N.D's mental status' why it was necessary for the assessor chronicle whether or not she had tattoos and the nature of the tattoos. I am at a loss to see how that would have an effect on any determination that have to make, or that he had to make."

He was remanded until his sentencing, which was scheduled for December 4, 1995. The Crown opposed the application for bail pending appeal. The appellant had the onus of satisfying the three conditions of s.679(3). He abided by the terms of the pre-trial release and had strong economic and family ties to his community. The real issue was the question of the public interest. The cases referred to where bail was sought prior to sentencing and in R. v. Smale (1980), 1979 CanLII 2925 (ON CA), 51 C.C. (2d) 126; and Osolin (Ont. C.A.). HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending his sentencing on the grounds that his detention was not necessary to the public good. The grounds of his appeal were not frivolous nor did it seem that there was much risk he would not appear in court when ordered. The court distinguished between the two cases and noted that the fact that the appellant had a lengthy record as a result of his convictions did not make this decision more strenuous than it would have."

The parents sought custody, or alternatively, to have the child remain with the present foster family. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly. The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis. 2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents.","The Department was requesting a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act. The foster parents had cared for the four and one-half year old for nearly 3 years with the assistance of parent aide [F.S]. The father was abusive and physically abusive to the mother and to her. The mother was hospitalized for attention deficit hyperactive disorder and the child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. HELD: The child was in need of protection and the natural parents were unable to care for the child particularly given her special needs. 1)It was absolutely clear to me that it was in the child's best interest to remain where she was and tocontinue to have contact with her natural parents. Given the special needs of the child, it was unlikely that an adoption plan would be made, and indeed to remove the child from the foster home could be extremely damaging and emotionally traumatic for the parents. 2)The natural parents, [L.C.] and her husband, were committed to the child and would care for her until she was 18. The natural parents testified that they love the child like our own and will not take in any other foster children as long as they have her.

2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody.

The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody and the Wife had access to the child through reasonable notice. The respondent brought an interim custody and access agreement in 1997. At that time the applicant was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a long-distance truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now worked day job in Saskatoon and the applicant changed jobs. She now lived in the home with her sister and had just recently been discharged from hospital. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence that the child or children are in some way at risk or other compelling reason. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists), but proceed to a final order. 2)The applicant was granted access every Tuesday and Thursday from 1:00 p.m. until 7:00 pm. Every other day until 8:00 am until 12:00 at which point access will be restricted to the applicant who commences kindergarten each morning and is with the respondent's sister each afternoon. 3)The alternative variation in access she has to Jacob would have the effect of decreasing the risk of an emotional breakdown and would not cause needless disruption to the children."

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian who served in the Canadian Armed Forces between 1951 and 1972 and who was discharged in March of 1972. The Plaintiff was not informed of nor was he offered any benefits that he was entitled to by reason of his service either under the Indian Act or any other relevant Act or Statute in force under the Canada Pension Act or other applicable legislation. The lengthy delay between the plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical report. All claims brought pursuant to the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act are subject to a limitation period of 6 years. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors' Pensions that they seek. HELD: The Court held that there were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that were individual to the class members. The Court was reluctant to deny a class member's day in court. 1) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England, if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. There is no suggestion that Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits after 1953. There was nothing before the court to indicate that they were properly informed of their right to do so. 2) The Court found that there was no bar to the bringing of motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. There were no errors in law, the facts as stated in the pleadings disclosed no reasonable cause of action.  3) The Act reflects an increasing recognition of the important advantages that the class action offers as a procedural tool. It is essential that courts not take an overly restrictive approach to the legislation, but rather interpret the Act in way that gives full effect to the benefits foreseen by the drafters. The benefits which the plaintiffs say were not paid to Indian war veterans in the 'Class Period' are set-up for a class proceeding and will be available to all members of the proposed class. The continuation of the action in those circumstances would be inconsistent with the clear legislative requirement that the representative plaintiff be anchored in the proceeding as class member with no stake in the potential outcome."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. In consequence, she held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and community supervision order because the respondent was deemed not to be serving the youth sentence he was serving. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the Youth Court is the same as that of R. v. Zundel (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.). However, the youth justice court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s. 102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision in the community. This is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) is only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. 2) Section 107(1) provides for an order under s102(1)(b) with any modifications that the circumstances require. It is not an order for review under s103. In fact, it is an analysis of the meaning of the word 'presence' in the context of rehabilitation and reintegration. The essence of the appeal lies in the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of sentence."

The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on the proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) The respondent exhibited an affidavit that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. It was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My client has instructed me to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. Although the law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; Few would initiate or participate in settlement negotiations at all if such could later be used to their detriment. 'What sensible man would attempt settlement if it could be used against him at trial?' This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote."

This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture.

The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The application is granted. 1) There has been a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Fairness to the accused requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable period of time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and to properly defend against the charges can also be defended. On the other hand, there have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2) There is no evidence that any lack of institutional resources caused any delays. The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she could have the matter rescheduled for trial. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion but denies liability. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiff and the defendants together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions. They did not measure, estimate or make note of the number of bushels or tonnes of crop lost. The evidence of wildlife damage was not accepted. Overall the damages were reduced by 5%. The plaintiff's losses were reduced due to poor drainage, poor soil quality, lack of access to the farm and extensive wildlife damage. The defendants were obliged to keep the fence in good repair. The damages sustained by the plaintiff were reduced as a consequence of the defendants' refusal to allow the plaintiff to access his property."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt, who was in bankruptcy for 28 months, objected to the automatic discharge of his former business, Revenue Canada. The bankrupt's claim fell into two parts; $166,359.72 representing net goods and services tax assessed for the period January 1, 1991 to July 31, 1992 and $14,223.30 for unpaid personal income tax for the 1991 taxation year. The claim of the Michalukis was for $58,720.34. Both creditors represented the vast majority of claims of unsecured creditors in this bankruptcy. There was also an issue regarding the use of tax information concerning the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company she was sole director and shareholder of. HELD: 1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. The Court cannot accept that the principle and exemption contained in s.295(5)(a) of the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of certain portions of the applicant's affidavit. 2)The bankrupt's application for a discharge was opposed by certain creditors. 3)The applicant argued that s.241 of the Income Tax Act prohibited the disclosure of this information. 4)Application for a conditional order of discharge was dismissed. 5)The Court was not convinced that these proceedings were final in nature. The determination of the proper order was difficult. The objecting creditor requested a substantial conditional order over a three year period.  6)The information disclosed in paragraph 19 was confidential and non-disclosure was improper."

The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. HELD: The Court accepted the submission that a $25,000 penalty was a significant penalty for Sutherland. Sutherland's failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time.

The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The father sought costs of $3,000 based on an application of a scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. The tariff is reproduced following Rule 77.18. The court imputed an income level to the father that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000) and assigned additional time to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the father was the appropriate primary care parent. The applicant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed to the applicant by the Court. The Court imputed a level to be determined by the respondent that would correspond to the parties total income. The respondent's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order herein."
7_2006skpc48.txt,"The Crown asks that the accused youth be detained. The Crown concedes that there is no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court or to prevent further occurrences. The Crown asks that she be detained because the crime is so horrible, the case is so strong and the public in La Ronge are so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The court does not keep a person in custody simply because they are accused of committing an offence. There must be a necessary and substantial reason to keep a person in custody before they have a trial. The accused youth will be released on strict conditions that will continue until her trial is complete.","The Crown conceded that there was no reason to detain the accused youth to ensure her attendance in court, before her trial, before anyone had given evidence against her, under oath, in a court of law, and before she had had a chance to defend herself at a trial. HELD: The youth was released on strict conditions which will continue until her trial was completed. The court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the injuries to the victim and determined that the appropriate sentence would be imposed. The Crown had argued that its case was strong, the offence was horrible, and that the public in La Ronge and area were so disturbed and shocked by the occurrence, that to release the youth would cause a loss of confidence in the administration of justice on the part of the public. The accused youth was not related to the current charges or accused youth in any way.  The court agreed with the Crown's position that because several persons have told the police that this youth committed a serious offence, I should confine her in custody even before she has a trial, even before anyone has given evidence in a Court of Law, and after she has had a trial to ensure that she had a proper chance to present her evidence in court. They also agreed that the release would create a negative attitude in the community because of the occurrence of unrelated crimes by unrelated persons.

9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed. There is limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with the responsibility of listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994,98 and interest at $995.03 or a total of $30,990.01.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs also sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act in my view precludes this type of pre-certification notice. However, the plaintiff's request is novel. The affidavit was filed for the sole purpose of providing the evidence that the Roussys had settled with the defendant and therefore could not be viable parties to this action. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre- certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. An action is defined under s. 8 of the class action as meaning 'an action that defined the Queen's Bench Act, 1998' and Class Action is defined as an action certified not as a class action pursuant to Part II' and the defendant moved to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that there is no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased Holguin vacation package from Red Seal. The Court is not prepared to broaden the scope of the Judge's decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and implementation of The Rules of Court do not permit a cross-examination of a plaintiff on an affidavit as they do in other cases. In this case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potentially class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. That could result in further motions arising out of this examination."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. After the separation, the respondent had continued to live with the appellant, who was a full time student. She had recently taken a job which would allow her to work 30 hours week at minimum wage but would require sleep and antidepressant medication. The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours a week at a minimum wage and testified that she was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. This was an error as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000 and the couple's daughter Catherine was still living with him and going to university full time."
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the school board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for the leasing of the buildings. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the Cape Breton Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The school board submits there is an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. The board does not seek reimbursement for rental costs in respect to leases for buildings used in delivering other than the basic Public school Program. The request is based on the submission the Province is statutorily mandated to provide free of cost the buildings that is now before the Court."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. An order suspending enforcement of arrears of approximately $14,600 was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. A further order was ordered to be paid in full immediately after the father commenced work as pipe-fitter. The father was to pay child support of $300 per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150.00 per month per child when he is less than $2200. Arrears were reduced by $7,000 and a further $200 was ordered on the ex parte payment of $25,600. 1)Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been a material change in circumstances. Since his employment is uncertain in his trade a flexible order would be appropriate."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded fixed costs in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)It is incumbent upon the Court not to permit unnecessary litigation to be paid for by the estate. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor & client costs claimed by the applicant; there is a needs-based approach to assess maintenance, as dictated by The Dependants' Relief Act, 1996. The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be ordered out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. In this situation, however, it is appropriate for the Court to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order which determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case."
6_2002nssc288.txt,"The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in Quebec and commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The plaintiff sues in Nova Scotia for a determination of question of law pursuant to Rule 25.01. The sole issue is whether the plaintiff is barred from suing in the province of Quebec because of a motor vehicle accident in Pictou, Nova Scotia. The applicants did not really make any submissions of substance concerning forum non conveniens and at the same time the applicants have not provided lot of information about the circumstances surrounding the accident such as whether any of them are resident; whether there are police reports; whether they were seen by doctors; if so, where they are located. If there is a procedural problem, a problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of the place where the injury occurs. The court looked at the factors set out in O'Brien vs. Attorney General of Canada and Oakley vs. Barrie and found that Nova Scotia is forum conveniens. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. It is an entirely different question, as I said, as to what law will apply to a trial in a Nova Scotia and, as the respondent has stated in his affidavit, the Court concluded that the law is the substantive law that governs will be the law in the Province of Quebec. The Court awarded costs to the applicant in the amount of $400.00 per month for the first two issues and $400 on the third issue. If the plaintiff has chosen Nova Scotia, following the next rule, unless the defendant, that is the applicants here, can show that the question of jurisdiction of the forum will govern, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction will govern. In the absence of so many facts, circumstances, and witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant the plaintiff will be unable to tell the Court what law applies to this case. In this situation, the only forum that seems to be forum convenien is Nova Scotia."" The Court found that the applicants had a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice and this right was subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non existiens and that more convenient forum exists elsewhere."
6_2010skqb264.txt,Defendants brought an application for an order setting a date for the plaintiffs' application for certification of the class action. The plaintiffs had failed to meet the litigation schedule by failing to deliver their written arguments and authorities and had not applied for an extension. HELD: The order of the Court established a timeline for the plaintiffs certification application and set a hearing date.,"FIAT: The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act as am. HELD: Although the time lines established by the court have expired, there will be an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the Hearing of the Plaintiffs' certification motion. If such an application is made, it shall be directed to:(a) Served and filed on or before August 27, 2010;(b) Made returnable on September 23, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. or other date as may be designated by the Court on application by the plaintiffs; and(c) Provide a hearing for the certification motion to be held in February 18, 2011."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. HELD: The court was of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her privacy and security interests. The court found an order should have been made."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive the ATV. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving a vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. At trial, the Court held that it was not that simple, but the defence was clearly not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the motor vehicle Act. They were words used in s.11 of the Act to include an all-terrain vehicle, which was a prohibited vehicle under s. 11, but that is not the charge before the Court at this trial."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was acquitted of all other charges. The Court reviewed the evidence and found the accused guilty of dangerous driving, dangerous driving and assault. The trial judge focused on the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her toward the side of the road and deliberately cut her off. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested she took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the circumstances. The evidence showed that the incident occurred on a residential street and that, apart from two parked cars, no other vehicles, pedestrians or children were present at the time of the incident. It was a case where the accused's manner of driving was dangerous to the public, contrary to the standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent driver."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. After several initial attempts, the application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards; and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in finding the application incomplete. The Applicant took issue with the development officer's decision to declare the application complete. HELD: The applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete.  1) the applicant received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, which was in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time it received the application. This decision is set aside. 2) It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The municipality relies upon subsections 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide as follows: an application for subdivision approval shall be approved if the proposed subdivision meets the road standards as they existed before it was received. The second requirement appears to be inconsequential. The grounds of appeal would have to be broader and arguably not covered under s. 250(3). The applicant insists that as a matter of law it had a right to have the final approval granted without meeting the higher road standard. However, the legislator's effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received a tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes is opposed by the applicant."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay 50% of the energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the plaintiff paid the defendant what the plaintiff terms deposit and what the defendant calls service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). The defendant argued that there were triable issues between the parties and the plaintiff's failure to file a defence was merely an excuse for its failure to do so. Dismissing the application, that the default judgment is not a mistake or an oversight. It is, in fact, a deliberate decision by the defendant to fail to meet the requirements set out in the Rule 12.06 of the Court of Appeal. In fact, it is the failure to act within the meaning of the Rule that allows the Court to exercise its discretion to set aside the judgment."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce and custody was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was also disposed of. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crops but the respondent closed his case without further argument about calling evidence on the tax implication. HELD: 1) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the Court declines to order any spousal support. 2) The respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. His income from his farming operation is $101,967 and he is responsible for $50,000 of farm income. 3) The farm partnership had the following debts as of June 9, 1999. The respondent is to pay one-half of the $96,600 paid to the petitioner by the respondent in his percentage based on the Guidelines. 4) The Court is of the view that capital cost allowance taken on machinery should generally not be added back for purposes of determining the income for the purposes of the Guideline purposes. The Court of Appeal agrees that $24,000 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase of the equity in the six quarters. 5) In the event the respondent fails to pay the amount of the loan secured by the van now in the possession of the the petitioner, the petitioner may apply for judgment against the respondent for the amount remaining unpaid. The total costs of the van are to be paid by the petitioner in their respective percentage. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent\'s personal land."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. HELD: In the circumstances, the court was not prepared to strike the phrases complained of. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty.  1) The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. If he does not have particulars the Court must go to the parties. 2) There is no evidence of a statutory or regulatory responsibility within the meaning of the Act. The Act is not an instrument for establishing, operating, or maintaining a school. The common law causes of action may arise from the same relationship and circumstances. The Government relies on R.E.L. v. J.G.S. (2000), 191 Sask. R. 204 (Sask. Q.B.) and the Public Officers' Protection Act which sets forth certain limitation periods depending on the nature of the claim.  3) In the circumstance here, the conduct of discovery and undertaking could provide the plaintiff with particulars to be make its allegations. The practice of law in negligence and contract the parties are taken to be independent and equal actors, concerned primarily with their own self-interest. However, as the defendant was in charge of the residential school at the time, the legislation governs its operation and maintenance. The defendant knew or ought to have known that the claim would be proven at trial, but did not. If there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, the defendant should not be driven from the judgment seat. 4) The evidence of past and future performance by the defendant in relation to all matters of this kind will be ascertained at trial. The evidence is conclusive that the Government is obliged to pay costs to the plaintiff for services performed within the knowledge and peruse of the statute. It is not necessary that the defendant know the law and regulations governing its operation or maintenance in order for the claim to be properly defended."
