1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, by-laws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The applicant argued that the test in American Cyanamid does not apply to this case. The appeal Division found that the respondent would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were granted and that it is against the public interest and the interest of other members of the Association to allow someone, who has been convicted of serious charges, to indefinitely postpone the imposition of a penalty. The respondent was found guilty of professional misconduct. An interim injunction was granted."

For the appellant, that the trial judge failed to consider whether the knife fit the definition of a weapon under s.2 of the Criminal Code and, in addition, failed to satisfy himself that the accused intended to use the dagger to cause injury or death or for the purposes of threatening or intimidating. The matter was remitted for a new trial.","The appellant was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the push dagger was concealed, that it was a weapon as defined in the Code, and that the appellant intended to use the weapon for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there is no evidence from which an inference of the appellant's intent in having the pushed dagger on his person might be drawn."
1991canlii2608.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's convictions on charges of operating overweight vehicles contrary to s.172 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The Court had overturned the convictions on the ground that the reverse onus provision of s.172, respecting the accuracy of the scale, violated s. 11(d) of the Charter. Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of R.S.N. 1967, and now s. 192 of the Regulations made under the Act. The trial judge found that s. 174 (now s. 193) of the Act was in violation because the Crown did not have any requirement to prove accuracy of the scales. The respondents appealed. Dismissing the appeals, that on the strength of the evidence, it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was operating his vehicle well above the permitted weight and tolerances on the highway and that the fine imposed by the trial judge was not saved by s. I. Charter."

She had been involved in previous accidents and also suffered from osteoporosis and hypertension. She displayed some symptoms of mental illness, including paranoid delusions. HELD: The Plaintiff's evidence as to her condition was not accepted. Based upon the opinion of her doctor, the court found partial disability of 3 months, and that her symptoms were fully resolved within 1 year. The court awarded general damages of $18,000.00.  The court refused to award damages for loss of housekeeping capacity, given the Plaintiff's disability prior to the accident.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident in the City of Regina. Liability was not in issue. The plaintiff was found to have a whiplash injury which had a period of about one year following the accident. She suffered from diabetes, osteoporosis and hypertension. Her physical therapist was not called to testify. HELD: The proper level at the time of the accident was $18,000.  1)No weight was given to the physical therapist's conclusions as to her present level of disability and her loss of housekeeping capacity as it would appear she was substantially disabled prior to the accident 2)No claim was made on the pecuniary damages awarded in respect of the loss of home furnishings or the lost ability to exercise. 3)The proper level of damages for the plaintiff was $20,000 which was adequately compensated by the non-pecuniary damage award.  4)Costs were allowed to be taxed. 5)The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. She had pre-accident injuries which were, according to medical evidence filed, substantiallyresolved over a span of about 1 year following her accident.  6)She was awarded costs of the action taxed."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant would pay the plaintiff a deposit and service fee of Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000) and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens and argued that it was neither an enforceable contract nor a reasonable excuse, as contemplated by the court's interpretation of Rule 12.06 in previous cases. Dismissing the application, that the defendant had not established any reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. In fact, the Court found that failure to act by the defendant in this instance was merely an excuse. The Court did not accept the respondent's submission that he did not appreciate the consequences of not appearing in Nova Scotia or Ontario and that any recommendations were superficial and of no help to the plaintiff as he took the position that the savings were unrelated to any advice from the defendant suppliers of fuel."
1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized. Then an accountant prepared a forensic audit. HELD: 1)The Court ordered the defendant to pay the solicitor/client costs taxed. Even if the defendant was substantially unsuccessful at trial in her allegations of wrongdoing by Bawol, still he ought to pay these costs because he caused the expense of the pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. 2)This was the more appropriate route in the circumstances. When all the evidence was in, it may transpire that Siemens was in fact, indebted to Bawoline as he now says he was at the time of the contempt. 3)The judge ordered the liability to be taxed."
1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and claims damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. HELD: The plaintiff's case was dismissed with costs. 1)The medical examiners did not meet the standard of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. The doctor's opinion was based upon the knowledge that the plaintiff was impaled on an iron fence for approximately 25 minutes and that the injury was a 'through and through' wound. 2)The primary issue was whether the defendants were negligent in the manner in which they dealt with the plaintiff's injury. 3)The plaintiff did not reveal any of the possible signs of soft tissue damage or infection. The pain and suffering was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants but rather the doctors' treatment was ineffective. 4)The only conclusion drawn was that the negligence was attributable to the acts of the defendants, not the doctors themselves. The medical evidence did not show any failure on the part of either of them, particularly the treating physician, to minimize the damage to the knee."
1999canlii1730.txt,"The offender was convicted of robbery. He and four other young men attacked and violently robbed a university student of jewellery and other valuables worth more than $7,000. Despite poor upbringing, abuse at the hands of his stepmother, and being moved from many foster homes, the offender had completed high school and one year of university. There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service. Accepting the joint sentence recommendation, that the offender is at a crossroads, and has the talent and motivation to become reintegrated into society as a productive member of the community, and who will benefit from a shorter term of imprisonment than is usual for this type of offence, combined with post incarceration supervision.","The accused was convicted of robbery. He was sentenced to two years in federal penitentiary followed by two years of probation. The four other accused took the stand in their own defence and were sentenced to 2 years probation. Upon seeing the accused, they chased him and ran him down and proceeded to beat him with kicks and punches while stealing his belongings. Photos were taken two days after the offence and showed the victim standing in the dark, in the wrong place at the wrong time. The accused's injuries were serious and he suffered severe damage to his eye and shoulder, bruising to his ribs, shoulder blades and temples, a fractured skull and friction burn to his waist were caused when people tried to tug the leather jacket up over his head and he was dragged by the group of five who joined them in robbing the victim."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The respondents had met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting and the motion to grant the relief was granted in part.  1)The applicants spoke of the public interest, it appears to be intimately entwined with their personal self-interests. 2)The Town Council took certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition. They undertook a tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. 3)In the circumstances, nothing turned on its presence or absence and it was ludicrous to suggest procedures were orchestrated so matters could be dealt with in the absence of the applicants.  4)There was no evidence of bad faith between the applicants and the respondent. The proposal did not have a pecuniary interest in the public advancement of the project. The onus of proving bad faith lies with the applicant. 5)The proposal was not disclosed for two weeks. During that time no action was taken by the Council, although the members may have given thought to the proposal, something which they were entitled to do. 6)There is a specific complaint of unfair advantage or discrimination by reason of the fact that the proposed hotel will be connected to the EverGreen Centre. The issues to be determined are: 1)whether the applicant met the prerequisites set out in the Municipality Act; 2)Has the respondent met its obligations pursuant to the bylaw; and 7)Has it met its obligation to act in good faith and in the best interest of the community by allowing the applicants to proceed with their proposed hotel project.  8)The respondents were excused from the meeting. The matter was taken under advisement by Council and the parties were invited to stay for the rest of the meeting, which was the usual procedure.  9)Nothing turned on their presence or in absence. The original motion to accept the proposal in principle was declared null and void.  10)The applicant were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants appealed their summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It did not matter whether the appellants were Indians within the meaning of s. 7 of the Constitution Act, 1867 or whether they possessed aboriginal hunting rights independent of that agreement. 2)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right, to the extent that it affected their 'Aboriginal rights' and their right to hunt at night with an artificial light. The trial judge did not go on to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. The issue was whether the limiting legislation was a prima facie infringement of aboriginal rights and, if so, whether it was justifiable. 3)The focus has shifted to the limiting legislations in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The decision was set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have failed to show any error in law."

The child is the petitioner's son from a prior relationship. The petitioner plans to have the child live with his biological father in Edmonton so that he can get the specialized medical care that he requires. When the petitioner and the respondent separated, they consented to a judgment, which granted the petitioner custody of the child and gave access rights to the respondent. The consent judgment provided that the petitioner was to provide the respondent with 90 days notice of any proposed change in the child's residence. Notice of the upcoming move was provided to the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. The consent judgment does not require the petitioner to get an order before changing the child's residence.

2008skqb33.txt,"The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs of the amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claim to remain would be an abuse of process. The paragraphs of the amended statement of claim at issue deal with the fact that the plaintiff alleges he was assaulted by the defendant and sustained bodily harm. The defendant was charged with assault, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. The issue is the effect of the acquittal in the criminal proceedings on the subsequent civil proceedings. HELD: The paragraphs of the statement of claim at issue do not amount to an abuse of process and the application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial is inadmissible in a subsequent civil trial as proof that the party did not commit the offence.  2) In the criminal proceedings brought by the Crown against the defendant, the Crown bore the onus throughout to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defence of self-defence did not apply and the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. In the civil proceeding, the plaintiff is in a position to control the presentation of his case and must prove his case on a balance of probabilities. The onus of proving self-defence is on the defendant. He bears the onus of proving the assault was justified and was made with reasonable force.","The applicants apply for an order pursuant to Rule 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules striking paragraphs 10, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 from the applicant's amended statement of claim on the basis that permitting these allegations in the statement of claims to remain would be an abuse of process. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) A verdict of acquittal in a criminal proceeding is inadmissible in a subsequent civil proceeding as proof that the party did not commit the offence. 2) The plaintiff bears the liability on the balance of probabilities of proving self-defence beyond a reasonable doubt. 3) In the criminal proceedings brought by the crown against the plaintiff, Mr. Windrem did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in cross-examination. His position was that the action was wrong against the individual alone which is alleged and the law should not preclude him from proceeding civilly by the mere fact that a criminal charge against the same conduct has been dismissed. Otherwise, the victim may not wish to report criminal activity as it may preclude his subsequent opportunity to proceed civilly. There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. Jurisdiction on a claim of this nature can be very sparingly exercised, and only in very exceptional cases. The outcome in each proceeding is irrelevant since the parties, issues, and burdens of proof are somewhat different. One who is convicted of criminal assault is not immune from later civil action for the damages resulting from that assault but he will be excused from paying punitive damages to his victim."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to this effect from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that the appellant's proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Constitution Act did not represent an actionable commitment for the benefit of the appellant. It held that, in the context of the appeal, the claim should be struck only if they appeared to be 'absolutely unsustainable' or 'certain to fail'. The court did not answer the question of whether the appellant committed an appealable error or whether the Chambers judge committed an error."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was found a person in need pursuant to the Employment Support and Income Assistance Act (ESIA). The applicant appealed the decision of the Board and the appeal was heard by the Assistance Appeal board on September 6, 2007. The Board allowed the appeal and found the applicant was 'a person in Need' as defined in the Act. The board ordered that his assistance was to be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was granted on the basis that the respondent had not complied with its decision, namely that the applicant had not requested further information from the applicant. HELD: The application for an order was granted. The respondent was ordered to implement the Appeal Board's decision retroactive to June 2007. 1)There was a clear legal right established to have the court enforce mandamus. The court found that there was a duty to the applicant by the parties seeking to be coerced to do the act requested and that duty owed must not be discretionary in nature but may be established either at common law or statute. 2)The applicant was awarded costs in the amount of $750 exclusive of disbursements."
2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with fishing without a licence contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations and four other offences under s. 13 of the Act. At the close of the Crown's Charter application, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, 1994. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s 27 of the act. The Court found that there was no violation order within s. 27, and all depend on the fact that the accused was prohibited from obtaining a fishing licence at the relevant times."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in part. The accused was found guilty of assault contrary to ss. 267(1)(a) of the Code. A Provincial Court judge found him guilty of the offence and granted him a conditional discharge with a probation period of 9 months. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, judge of that Court quashed his conviction and ordered a new trial. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge was correct in his reasons. While the accused's mistake of fact was reasonable, he would not have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate to his response, the Court found that the officer in question was not the same person who had been afraid and had not been listening to what the accused was saying. The trial judge did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence and in particular focused on the fact there were two officers present."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The primary issue between the parties was custody of their four children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. HELD: The children were in joint custody of the respondent and they resided an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks.  1) This custodial disposition is a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. 8(2)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines which provides. 9. Where a spouse exercises right of access to, or has physical custody of, child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of year, the amount of support would be determined by taking into account the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and other circumstances which are relevant (9(c)). The Court must take into consideration only the best interests of the children as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs of those children. 2) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children now is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children are bonded to their mother. 3) There was no evidence of the increased cost that would be incurred by [C.O.] and [K.O.' as a result of sharing custody. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision."
2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. The parties agreed that the Husband would have interim sole custody. In 1997 the Wife was diagnosed with unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She had just undergone treatment for depression. She was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now lived in a day job in Saskatoon. The Wife was the more loving and caring parent and there was no allegation the child was at risk in the present arrangement. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of any evidence of risk to the child. The consistent case law indicates that once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on an interim basis to vary the arrangement (except where risk of a child exists). In this province, that means obtaining a pre-trial date for pre- trial conference and if the matter is not resolved at that stage, proceed to trial where the Court will determine what is in the best interests of the children. 2)It appears from the foregoing case law that it constitutes, and is a reversible, error to vary this interim custody regime pending trial. The fact that the applicant has filed a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health is stable and that she can care for the child over extended periods of time, does not relieve the Court of the need to disturb the peace and harmony between the parties."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife was left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. In many cases she was left with nowhere to live. The husband owned some assets but his share was only $2,000 as he was quick to claim exemption for his own house, which they never lived in, and all of the assets which he had before the marriage. HELD: The husband was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,900. 1)The matrimonial home was owned by the wife prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. These two items were subject to income tax so a 30% deduction was applied to their value leaving a $7,690 value. To that number must be added the accrual to a Sun Life policy during the same period of $2200 for $8,890. 2)The wife assumed debts of $3,000. She had obtained a grade 12 equivalency; she held down two jobs; one as noon supervisor in the school system and one as office cleaner at night. Both had the benefit of the matrimony home during the marriage and both had the prospect of an inheritance from her mother, a good pension, and in short no financial problems.  3)It was in its entirety inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs because the petition made no property claims whatever.  4)The husband had to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home or to rental accommodation. The wife's house, jointly owned with his mother as protection 'in case he meets someone' is exempt property."

Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff of $4,007.83. 1) The Court was satisfied that there was a discussion about round pillars and it was intended that they would be a part of the contract. The plaintiff moved off this position only when he was forced to in order to effect sale. This is only a prima facie measure. 2) The addition of extras was clearly an extra ordered by plaintiff. He was liable to pay for the work but was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. Only an estimate was provided and some tolerance should be allowed. 3) The cost of the extras was $5,900 which was the amount to be paid to the defendant by the appraiser. There was no evidence that any of these extras occurred during the construction of the home. The appraiser was knowledgeable about the subject matter and knew the plaintiff would pay for extras. She did not indicate that the extras were an extra with the plaintiff to be responsible for the cost. The Court held that the plaintiff was liable for $3,500 due to the delay. 4) The defendant did not press on as he might have. He did not ensure that the program of construction was clearly defined and adhered to. The amount of extras which the owner requested would be treated as an extra over and above the contract price. This was a diminution of value of value."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The tenant entered into a two-year commercial lease with the intention of fixing the damaged premises. The landlord vacated the premises and the tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator quashed. The tenant argued that the arbitration clause under the lease was a limited arbitration clause which allowed the court to determine who had the duty to repair and to use other canons of construction including estoppel. The arbitrator determined that all disputes between the parties were to be settled by arbitration, but only disputes involving the clauses of the lease itself. The court could not find a case where the decision of an arbitrator, protected by a privative clause, was patently unreasonable. Both parties agreed that the standard of review of an award of consensual arbitrators was the same that for statutory tribunals, which involved arbitrators, the decision should be interpreted broadly. The arbitration clause in both the Landlord and the Tenant leases was different in that it did not provide an interpretation of the collective agreement by a consensual arbitrator. The issues were with respect to responsibility for repairs, whether the loss was covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required. They involved a dispute about insurance coverage and whether insurance should be required. These were recognized grounds for the Court to intervene. The award of damages was awarded in the amount of $318,252.00 for repairs and $59,130.34 for loss of rental opportunity. The Court held that the arbitrators in both cases were within the learned arbitrator's jurisdiction and there was no jurisdiction to resolve a claim such as this which arises from the Landlords/Tenants relationship itself and not the clauses and provisions of the leases. The Arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words of the clause. He could deal with the issue of jurisdiction in a broader context."
2_2004nssf92.txt,"The husband applied to have the wife's application for retroactive child support to cover the costs of the child's post-secondary education struck as a matter more properly addressed as an issue of contract. In addition to the child support ordered in the Corollary Relief Judgment, the husband had signed a document in which he agreed to repay the costs of the daughter's American student loans (which had to be obtained in the wife's name as the wife was an American). The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The father, who was the only family member who could secure loans to pay for his daughter's education, applied pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the mother's application for a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive child support order. The mother argued that she was not concerned about the form of relief as it amounted to an amendment to the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The father applied for consolidation so that one hearing could be held. Application to strike or to retroactively vary the child support orders dismissed; the father's application dismissed. There was ample evidence before the Court to determine that there has been material change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement. The indemnity agreement may be something that the daughter can rely on as a promise made to her in the event that she is called on to pay the balance of the Federal Plus loans. The only person who has been required to pay any of the outstanding debts is the mother. Both parties acknowledged this existing obligation and came to an agreement that it was to be paid for by the applicant. The application to strike it dismissed. It is well established that on an application pursuant to rule 14.5 to strike an action, judge must proceed on the assumption that the facts contained in the pleadings are true and assuming those facts to be true, consider whether claim is made out. An order to strike all or part of a pleading is to be exercised with great care and caution and only in the most exceptional and clear circumstances. The question is whether the additional loan payments were known or anticipated at the time of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The mother's pleading was not frivolous or vexatious. It was plain and obvious that the father was responsible for the children's education and that his sole recourse would be to strike her application. 2)The applicant had not established that her daughter's educational expenses were a matter of contract with the father and therefore there was no basis for this application. The fact that the applicant had secured several loans and that she could rely on them for her education did not change the fact that her main issue was debt and she was unable to rely on any of them to pay it all.  3)The father was entitled to costs in the amount of $20,000 per year for the duration of the loan, which was set out in the Corollary Relief judgment. He was also entitled to declaratory relief."

By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT.

As a corporation, a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged, as the plaintiff is and was 609, the defendant's counsel is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. The action remains derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the company against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage.

2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, a resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, finding the respondent was low risk to reoffend and of no real danger to society. He found the venture to be commercial one, albeit of small-time nature. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part (orally). It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The Court is all of the view the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but in these circumstances there is no basis for interfering with the sentence. A more significant issue is the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeition of the vehicle used to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The truck had value of approximately $20,000. It was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. In relation to a vehicle, the Court may take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on the immediate family of the person charged or convicted of the offence provided the dwelling house was member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member's residence and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence."

As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever the matters of custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. The grounds for divorce had been proven.

HELD: 1) The matrimonial property or its value, both as defined in s. 2, be distributed equally, subject only to the exceptions, exemptions, and equitable considerations mentioned in the Family Property Act. The purpose of the legislation is to recognize that child care, household management and financial provision are the joint and mutual responsibilities of spouses and that inherent in the spousal relationship there is a joint contribution, whether financial or otherwise, by the spouses to the assumption of these responsibilities that entitles each spouse to an equal distribution of the family property to be distributed. 2) The family home is divided equally.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for workplace stress. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in determining that the workplace events and stressors required that there be work related events or stressors that are unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. The appeal turned on one main issue: in deciding the worker's gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA), was the tribunal wrong to assess the nature of the workplace event and stressor from an objective point of view? The appellant contended that the law prior to the Policy was not settled and that the Policy is declaratory of the better view of the law on this aspect of gradual onset trauma claims under GECA. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The policy adopted by the Board is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. It follows that the policy is consistent with the principles very recently enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC (CanLII). 1) Before the policy was adopted, there was some inconsistency within WCAT concerning whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the workplace stressors. This reflects the law which was in place before the Policy came into effect in July 2005. The Board exercised its policy-making authority to bring clarity to these issues. The Policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stress are compensable under the GECA and set out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The only issue which the Court could not resolve was whether the objective approach applied to this issue. 2) The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors in the workplace, and faced with the evidence of an injury by an accident arising out of and in the course of employment, she failed to draw that causal link between the injury and his stress injury. The premise of the appeal was that the Board adopted policy 1.3.6 which applies to decisions made on and after July 25, 2005. In this case, the Appeal Commissioner relied on the decision of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal in Rees, supra. The Court did not understand the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. 3) The Court reviewed the history of decision making and found that GECA is still applicable in Nova Scotia and the policy has been broadly applicable to all of the circumstances since it was adopted.

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed an order of the Director allowing the Tenant $787.50 against the Landlord as compensation for what the Director found to be a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was damp and riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The Tenant testified that there simply was no mould. Her position was that the landlord used grey spray paint to resemble mould. When the mould first began to develop the landlord was totally unresponsive to her complaints throughout. He subsequently moved out and brought this application for compensation. Photographs of mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. The condition of the premises was clearly described by the Tenants. The owner of the building inspector's report was found to have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. The bylaw inspector was unable to find mould and, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away it. HELD: Appeal allowed. The damages were set at $862.50. The plaintiff's claim was also rejected as being less legitimate than that of the general claim of $13,000 which was advanced with less jurisdictional involvement. The furniture, rug and clothing were significantly damaged and the plaintiff's health claim at $1,000 more than her original estimate of $12,000. Costs were also increased. Although the plaintiff was essentially correct in discounting the value of the furniture and clothing, she was not credible and her explanation was not probable. She had advanced a general claim for damages which could not be discounted."

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an occupational health and safety charge under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health of persons at the workplace. The guilty plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant had been out all night, had been drinking and had not slept. He had made substantial changes to his farm since the tragedy of the dairy farmer's death, including building a new dairy barn. However, he was in no condition to operate equipment which he needed to remove manure from the manure pit and placed himself at risk. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability because he also had no prior record for safety violations."

HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.

The Crown claims the trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not fail to fulfil the objective grounds for the demand. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors beyond a reasonable doubt. 2) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as a whole and need not prove prima facie case. The evidence was that the accused stumbled and fell shoulder first into his truck as he turned around. Thereafter, the accused sat in his vehicle with the door open and his left leg out while he unsuccessfully searched for his driver's licence and registration. This is not a position from which swaying would normally be observed. The accused had difficulty walking or getting in and out of vehicles. The short route from Esterhazy to Weyburn is to Stockholm. The U-turn, while illegal, was explained as part of the act of returning to Gerald in order to re-orient himself. 3) The accused was cooperative and asked what was going to happen to his truck. He gave up the keys to his vehicle upon request by the officer. He volunteered that he had consumed alcohol with his last drink some hours earlier. The officer noted no other swaying or difficulty in the short observation period of about 3 minutes from the time of the stop to the time the demand was made. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds that he was impaired were subjective and subjective. The police officer did not question the credibility of either of the officers."

The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","Pellicer v. Williams, 2012 NSSC 267 (CanLII) The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent did not persuade the Court to reduce his child support obligation. The matter required court time on two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. On the important parenting issue, the evidence established that the Applicant was the appropriate primary care parent. The appellant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. The Court imputed an income level to the appellant that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000). Costs of $3,000 are assessed against the respondent. This is a costs decision. The parties' case law, L.N.D. v. L. (M.S.), 2010 NSSCP 159 and 2012 SSSC 423 have been litigated. The issue of costs claimed by both parties was central issue. The applicant's case to set aside the parties' separation agreement was dismissed and Ms. Robar was found to have been unreasonable. She was also found to not have rejected offers to settle.

Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's application was an effort to compel a retrospective consideration of past circumstances of the child rather than an assessment of her current circumstances.

The appellant's husband reported the problem to the agency it sought its intervention because he alone could not care for the child. The basis on which the application was made was that the appellant consented to or agreed with the 1993 order on the faith of the agency's then plan of care which envisaged that an adoption plan would be initiated by the appellant. Unfortunately, the adoption plans did not materialize because the mother had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized. She sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of Rule 1.04 of the Family Court Rules.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witness called at trial was the plaintiff. The action was brought against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by the defendant from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. The defendant did not appear at trial nor did it enter defence to the allegations contained in the statement of claim. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)It did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  2)The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff in an attempt to keep it operational were taken for the benefit of the company. As it turned out, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  3)The plaintiff's evidence did not establish that the defendant had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from the defendant. In fact the evidence indicates that the plaintiff gave notice to the plaintiff, Redhead, that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchasing order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard's creditors regarding the payment of these accounts.  4)The defendant was awarded taxable costs of the claim."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant is for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into her canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff's canola crop on one occasion and that such loss is minimal. The defendant denies liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in the amount of $2,533.45. Based on the evidence and on the above findings, the plaintiff was awarded a total of 557 bushels of crop loss, price per bushel, loss of crop value and Dockage. 1)Under the present legislation the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle may be absolute. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions. It was mere supposition that other neighbours' cattle had been in the canola during the relevant period. Given the knowledge that neighbours have of each other in rural Saskatchewan, it would be expected that the defendant would have placed before the court some evidence supportive of his supposition. 2)The damages sustained by the plaintiffs were as follows:Total Crop Loss 557 Bushels; Price per bushese; Less 5% reduction in damage reduction re Yield Calculation 152.05Less 2% Wild Animal Damage 61.05 less 5% for Dockage 152.62. 3)Dockage was assessed at the elevator. 4)Diligence was given to the plaintiff for dockage. 5)The plaintiff was entitled to give opinion evidence with respect to crop damage.  6)Costs were deducted from the total crop loss. 7)Judgment for costs were deducted against the plaintiff."

HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","The applicant sought interlocutory injunctive relief on a quia timet basis and to enforce what the applicant says are restrictive covenants, obligations of confidentiality and fiduciary duty binding on the respondents.

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue.

The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues.

4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board of Revenue Commissioners reversed. The appellant had appealed under s. 21 of The Revenue and Financial Services Act. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The documents were ordered on the same purchase order and were identified as separate items. Clause 22 of the purchase order, terms and conditions specifies that title passes upon payment. The documentation was separately invoiced. 2)If, as the board found, the purchase of the documents was an independent transaction, was it exempt by virtue of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act? The answer was no. The Board determined as finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 3)The evidence was conclusive that the documents were not being prepared by the Appellant for the purposes of preparation in Saskatchewan. There was no guideline or criteria for the taxing authority to apply. The respondent could look to administrative policy as a factor which may be considered in cases of doubt about the meaning of legislation."

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision pursuant to s62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The appellant's employee had been shoplifting and was later charged with shoplifting. She sought and obtained a record of employment from the salon. The adjudicator rejected the employer's submission that the employee had frustrated or breached her employment contract, thereby releasing the appellant from any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. The employer then launched the appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. His decision did not appear to be patently unreasonable because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. The appeal based on the submission the employer erred in law by ruling that the employment contract was not frustrated or had not fulfilled its obligations was dismissed. 2)The employer acted well within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of the employee's employment contract were and that Cajon hadnot fulfilled obligations thereunder. Although not all of the facts presented to the Court were known to this Court, his decision outlines some of the evidence uponwhich he could have arrived at his conclusion. The doctrine of frustration cannot be applied to the circumstances of this case."
4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He sought damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had been employed from 1988 to 1997 as guidance counsellor at the education complex.

4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. In 2000 the applicant submitted its last plan for final approval, which was determined by the development officer to be incomplete. The development officer declared the application in error and declared it incomplete. Land developer seeks an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision that the application was incomplete, b. declaring the application is in fact complete, and c. mandamus ordering the municipality to issue the final approval. Grant, Q.C. J. Scott, M.D. for the applicant, and M.G. Grant for the respondent. HELD: 1)The Municipality's reliance on s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard are applicable to this Application. The Applicant takes issue with the development officers decision to declare the application incomplete and looks to this Court for relief. The application is incomplete. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the Application is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan).  2)The applicant has a legitimate right to appeal a refusal to approve a concept plan or tentative subdivision approved by the municipality. The Municipality has a different interpretation of s. 283 of the Act which limits the Board's jurisdiction on appeal. It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. The fact that the applicant failed to meet the newly incorporated road standards and that one of the bearings on the plan was missing represented a major obstacle for the Applicant. It means a much more expensive road construction process. 3)On the same day, the applicant takes issue at bar, which is the issue at hand. The Court reviewed the plans submitted by the applicant and found that the lots were substantially the same as shown on the tentative plan. The respondents agreed that the respondent had correctly interpreted the wording of the proposal to mean that the proposal would be approved if it met the road standards as they existed at the time it was submitted. 4)The Court reviewed all aspects of the applicant's plan and found the applicant would have been entitled to final approval if it had been granted mandamus within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative Plan. 5)The application was also subject to the mandamus interpretation available in the context of the legislation generally.

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation, restitution of 1/2 the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation. The appellants applied for leave to appeal and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the full amount rather than one half of the sum as submitted by the parties.

4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and cocaine and a knapsack for the purposes of trafficking. The evidence seized was admissible against the accused. The accused was a student the previous year and had travelled by car to Western Shore to have beer. The police had found a backpack stuffed with cocaine and knapsacks, which they placed at his feet in the front passenger seat and in the back of the accused's car. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court.  1) The evidence established that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. The fact that it was found in an open motor vehicle was significant in its conclusion that the cocaine was possessed for sale, not personal use. 2) The uncontroverted expert evidence was that the amounts of both marijuana and cocaine, found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and all of the circumstances establish that the possession was for the use of trafficking and so find. Possession of property obtained by crime. The Crown did not call evidence but argued that this was a circumstantial case in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that these drugs and cash were possessed by the defendant. 3) The Court accepted that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 each were in his possession and that, because they were in small denominations, found at the same location as large quantities of cocaine, marijuana, and cocaine rolled in a manner that would be familiar to drug dealers to hold their proceeds of sale. The cash was found to be in the hands of a student that had access to the computer and was able to look through the window to see if any of the cash had changed hands. It was obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. 4) The Crown must establish beyond reasonable doubt, beyond areasonable doubt, that the items seized by the police were a result of drug trafficking and that the cash was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit the plaintiff to properly defended the action. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not fulfill the requirements of Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. 2) The defendant is under a positive fiduciary duty to protect the plaintiff from injury to his person, physical or mental health or morals and the defendant knew or ought to have known that the plaintiff would suffer damages if the defendant failed to carry out its duty.

4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as a result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and a 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either either alcoholism or lack of proper care, there should have been an order directing a trial of an issue rather than making a decision made on the written evidence. Even if the hearsay were admissible given the indirect denial by the daughter of either an either or of the father that she suffered from it, there was no case for even direction of trial, let alone an order in favour of the appellant. The fact that the affidavits were based on hearsay rather than sworn evidence, they should not have been considered."
4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff is awarded $500. The defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and $500 to the plaintiff. 1) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2) The court found no case law on point in this province and am unable to distinguish the actions of the defendant in Restauronics Services Ltd. v. Forster. 3) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. The Court held that the plaintiff in this case was entitled to no more than nominal damages and awarded it the money that was awarded. 4) The plaintiff was not in a position to perform further work for PCS if the defendant had not submitted a proposal. The decision to hire outside electricians was made two weeks before the contract ended, which persuaded the court that it was not confidential information or a trade secret.  5) The only issue left for the plaintiff is whether the defendant breached his duty of fidelity by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed. The court awarded the plaintiff $500 as general damages."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act. HELD: 1) The fact that one is not the biological parent of the children does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. However, given the short-term relationship and the fact that the applicant has the ability to pay spousal support, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the applicant should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. 2) The applicant has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such that to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. It is pertinent to note that this was an application brought by the applicant for interim relief in respect of family property in which the respondent was to pay a sum of $1,500 per month. The respondent may have been in a position to pay but the Court cannot determine that. 3) The respondent has not proven that he stands in locus parentis vis a vis the parties. The application for interim child support is dismissed with costs."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On August 16, 2006, six days shy of the two year limitation period, the plaintiffs claimed that DDH, the female plaintiff had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants applied to compel the plaintiffs to provide particulars of their injuries, at a minimum, before discovery. HELD: The defendants' applications were granted. Each of the defendants had furnished a draft order, very similar in substance to the one mandated by Rule 139. In this particular case, both the first and second reasons have merit. The defendant defendants must know, with more particularly, garnered from the passage of time and therapeutic treatment and healing of the plaintiff, the extent of her injury and whether there will be a chronic disability, their costs and leave will be asked at the trial of this action to prove the amount of the said loss and expense and special damages for same as such are not now fully ascertainable. There are other considerations as well. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of the motions than he was able to infer from the material presently before him."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The issue of access was mutually agreed to between the respondent and the child who was now 18 years of age. HELD: 1) The petitioner was to have judgment against the respondent for $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. The judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land. 2) The respondent was to pay $1,200 as interest for each month until June 3, 1999. 3) The amount of the mortgage debt was paid off by the respondent in the amount of $24,000.00. 4) The average capital cost allowance taken on the machinery should not be added back for purposes of determining the income of the respondent. 5) The Court of Appeal was of the view that the capital cost allowances taken on land should generally not be paid back. The respondent's income was reduced as he failed to give notice of the expert in contravention of the Rules of Court.  6) There were no costs awarded to either party and each must pay his or her own costs."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) whether ongoing support was warranted; and 3) costs. The child care expenses incurred did not meet the requirements set out in s. 7(1)(a) of the Family Maintenance Act. The respondent's income for child support purposes was $35,269.44 and he had no assets or spousal support. The Court found that retroactive child support should be fixed at $1,500 with costs to the respondent to the extent they were retroactive to August 2000; and 4) if the respondent's daughter continued to require additional support she should pay his 59% share of those expenses within 10 days of receiving them."
5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive pay: NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The appellant had argued that the employer for whom the employee had worked during the term of the agreement was the same employer. Arbitrator found the phrase in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He concluded in his ratio that: 1) these competing aids to interpretation, do not find that the phrase 'any employer' in the context of this collective agreement is an unambiguous one. am unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history. As result, the grievance is dismissed."
5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act and that the Chambers judge had made errors in his approach to the application of the relevant statutory provisions. The respondent was a 'proper person' to bring the application. He had attended the University from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2006 and was actively involved in the referendum campaign and was a leading voice against joining the Federation. He was a member of the Students' Union during the referendum process and had been a contributing factor to the decision of the Elections Board.
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father sought party and party costs out of the estate. The son sought costs against his father on the basis that his parents made mutual wills supported by an implied promise against revocation, which his father breached by making a will in favour of his sister after his mother died. The father and his daughter were now acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation' and the father was not required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son. It was not about the meaning of his mother's will. She clearly made a gift to him that failed. The evidence referred to at para. 23 and 24 of the main decision showed that the possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the deceased's daughter. However, the application was sham and the son was acting on his own. He was represented in his personal claim by the father who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successfulparty in the actual case. In light of the present position of the father and the daughter, those three parties will bear their own costs."

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence.

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of fixed commission between the parties. The plaintiff sought to withdraw his claim against the defendant for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit. Finding for the plaintiff, that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the absence of an enforceable agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruits or unjust enrichment. HELD: The plaintiff was granted the requested time limit of one week. The court found that the defendant was honestly in error in believing that the terms of the agreement were with the plaintiff and that the payment would be in the range of 6% to 10% commission. In light of the amount of the settlement the plaintiff had already paid the defendant, it was reasonable to expect that the commission structure would be negotiable."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","The appellant commenced an action against the respondent physician alleging negligence in the performance of a circumcision. The respondent had performed a circumcision on the appellant three days after the appellant went into the emergency department complaining of pain. The appellant sought to have the doctor appointed as an expert witness and for his opinion concerning the medical services provided to the appellant. The chambers judge refused to appoint the doctor as a court expert and ordered him to answer questions put to him in both sets of interrogatories. The doctor, who treated the appellant as a physician, was not party to the action. He was only appointed to answer interrogatories that required his opinion, including those involving questions concerning the standard of care, breach of that standard and resulting damages. The issue before the court was whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories were opinions which the chambers judge required to be answered. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal allowed in part.  1)The chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory that require an opinion, even if this requires the doctor to disclose the opinions that went into making his judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant, even though he may possess an expertise in the area of treatment. The distinction between fact and opinion may not be clear. Eckersley v. Terwiel, (1991) 1 S.C.L.R. (3d) 289 (S.C.)C.A.). This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles were applied or manifest injustice has resulted. 2)While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions the doctor should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant's counsel and the court. This decision expressly does not deal with the issue of physicians who are co-defendants or non-partners who have not subsequently treated a party to this litigation. A physician who is a subsequently treating physician to a patient can be required to answer an interrogator that requires an opinion on the basis of opinion. The physician has answered all of the interrogatory questions. He has provided the names of three other urologists whose names were provided by the doctor. There is no evidence of any other attempts by the applicant to engage an Expert witness.  3)The appellant is entitled to have these answered even if the appellant declined to answer any particular one as he may be advised, which may result in unreliable temporary opinions, given by people without all the relevant factual information."

Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

The charge arose out of a tragic incident aboard a fishing vessel in which a fisher, who was required to perform duties mainly for him, was found to be in a relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of an independent contractor. The accused was a self-employed fisherman. He was dependent on Harnish for the boat and part of the gear, on Coolen for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of gear.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent is in a relationship with the child and the child is his child. The child is the biological son of the respondent and the respondent is his parent. This is an important decision. The threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution for the natural parental role.

HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750, and secured debt of $150,000.

He sought a conditional order of discharge in the amount of $188 per month for a total of $2,256.

6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parties met in 2000. The father had had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement was fraught with difficulty for reasons which could not be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the principal residence be varied and awarded to her son. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters, the court has found him not entitled to the Child Tax benefits and had been overpaid. There are red flags. The evidence shows that the father is prone to frequent interruptions of the mother's counsel. He has made a concerted effort to improve his parenting skills and the children have become increasingly distant and disrespectful in the care of their father. This has adversely affected the children's relationship with their mother. It is appropriate to give a consideration to the relationship of the child to the psychological parent, the bond between them, and the importance of maintaining stability in that relationship. 2) The father has bounced from home to home.

6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognition. The issue is whether the recognizances should be granted again. HELD: The accused is remanded to November 12. The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions, including 12 assault related convictions, 2 common assaults against his spouse, 1 serious personal injury offence and 2 serious violent offender re-offences. There are three escapes from lawful custody and he is now assessed as a high risk to re- offend sexually and required to complete high intensity sex offender programming. The Progress Reports contained in Exhibit P-1 are unbiased and present in a professional and accurate manner. They present in an objective manner both favourable and unfavourable information relative to the accused. While both impose restrictions upon an individual's freedoms such restrictions are only those as are necessary to assist the individual from committing future offences or misconduct.

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: The applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial to prove the 2013 will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied that the applicant had not made an issue out of the question on the basic principles of the test in Quaintance. It is appropriate to review the authorities as they are a matter of option for the Chambers judge if the evidence itself is not in dispute and the only questions are the inferences to be drawn from the facts. 2) It is important to maintain the strength of the case the challengers must present, conversely, what type of case must the propounder of the will present in order to avoid trial and obtain a grant of probate? 3) The evidence is insufficient to properly prove the will. The Court found that the respondent had not proven his case on a balance of probabilities or otherwise. The threshold for the challenge is reasonably low and the Court found there was insufficient evidence to support a trial."

7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each individual item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward a final agreement would constitute separate, independent and binding agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce. 3)The fiat in question was set aside by the Queen's Bench Rules, Rule of s.44 of the Queens' Bench Act, and by the Court of Appeal in Bells v. Childs Estate, [1984]W.W.R. 115, at page 60."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment.

They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving over.08 after a stop by a RCMP officer. The Crown appealed on the basis that the summary conviction appeal court decision had erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by RCMP officers. The stop was conducted in order to check his licence and proof of insurance. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The respondent refused, saying that he was impaired by alcohol. The RCMP officer gave the respondent a breath sample without requiring a test with an ALERT screening device. The accused argued that his s. 8 Charter rights had been infringed. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 189a(1) of the Highway Traffic Act on the right not to be arbitrarily detained guaranteed by s. 9 of the Charter is a reasonable and constitutional right. The flexible approach to the argument in favour of the Crown in Hufsky v. R. was based on the fact that the respondent had voluntarily complied with the officer's request to stop his vehicle. There was nothing improper about the stop. The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9.Constitutional law prohibits the unreasonable search and seizure of vehicles by police officers. However, if a driver is stopped by a police officer, that officer is subject to detention which is sufficiently lengthy to provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel. In this case, the stop was arbitrary and, therefore, the accused was being 'arbitrarily detained'."
7_1995canlii5894.txt,"The Defendants applied to sever the issues of liability and damages for purposes of the trial of this matter. The trial was to be held before a jury.HELD: 1)The Court has a general discretion as to severance of issues which must be exercised judicially. 2)Severance should only be ordered when the judge has a serious reason to believe that the trial of the issue proposed to be severed will put an end to the action. 3)The Court accepted the Plaintiff's submission that expert medical evidence would be necessary to establish the cause of the accident since the Plaintiff had suffered brain damage and would be unable to testify. This medical evidence would have to be repeated to establish the Plaintiff's damages if the issues were severed and liability was found. 4)The severance of the issues would deny the Plaintiff the right to have the jury determine his damages. A jury cannot be disassembled and then recalled to conclude the trial of the remaining issues. 5)The Court was of the view that there should be compelling reasons before issues should be severed for trial, but that no compelling reason had been established in this case.","This was an application by the defendant for an order pursuant to the Court's inherent jurisdiction severing the issues of liability and damages. The defendant argued that a trial of liability would be unnecessary given the quantum of damages claimed by the plaintiffs and given the volume of evidence necessary to prove the aspect of the claim, the prior determination of liability may result in a very significant reduction in trial time and costs. HELD: The application for severance of the issues should only be granted for the compelling reasons and in cases in which it is probable that the trial of one issue will put an end to the action. Liability was in issue. The plaintiffs had served demand that the issue of liability be heard by a jury. The judge must have some evidence which will make it at least probable the issue will finally put an ending to the proceedings. The Court in Beddow also emphasized the importance of credibility in the quantum portion of the trial. In a review of recent Supreme Court decisions, the Court held that a jury, whether discharged or not, can be reassembled some time later to carry on with the second part of a trial. This was a case where it was arguable that the plaintiffs may well be disentitled from their right to have a medical opinion to establish the origin of the causation of the injuries. Such an opinion would necessarily be required in an accident to be consistent with the causal relationship between the injuries sustained and the medical evidence required to establish causation. Thus, the plaintiffs' application to be dismissed would be premature given the huge amount of evidence already established as to the cause of the accident."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters.

He proposed that his support obligation be eliminated or reduced during his months of unemployment. Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the father since 1994, there had been a material change in circumstances. A flexible order was suggested."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

He raised two preliminary issues regarding the use of tax information concerning his common law spouse and the company she was sole director andshareholder of. HELD: 1)Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules requires that affidavit evidence must be based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge. The determination as to what may and what may not be final is often difficult. 2)The bankrupt's claim for $58,720.34 represented amounts outstanding on a failed agreement and lease in Manitoba to the bankrupt. The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do.  3)The only defence the bankrupt had was that he had been advised by a lawyer that Section 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act could not be defended. 4)Reasons for the automatic discharge of the bankrupt were:1)The claim of Revenue Canada fell into two parts; $166,359.72 represents net goods and services tax assessed for the period January 1, 1991 to July 31, 1992 and $14,223.30 for unpaid personal income tax for the 1991 taxation year. 5)Tax arrears were to be paid on the balance of the claim payable in full. 6)The debtor was to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee pursuant to Rule 319."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonet and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The Credit Union took the position that it should be re-imbursed either as Quantum Meruit or because it had been unjustly enriched and would allow financers to effectively'store' fixtures on the property. Gari did not advance a claim either in trespass or on a basis that s. 65(5) of the PPSA itself creates a cause of action. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there. The reasonable rental value can be estimated, albeit with limitations, by reference to the amount of improvement taxes the plaintiff had to pay to keep the town from taking the property for taxes. 2) The Court found that the trial judge erred in dismissing the application. There was no evidence of unjust enrichment or of rent paid by the respondent to the respondent. 3) The respondent has been attempting to obtain the consent of a landowner for over one year and it is appropriate to grant the costs of the application to the landowner. With respect to the claim for occupation rent and reimbursement of taxes paid over the past year, the portion of the applicant application is dismissed. 4) The material suggests the Applicant had no use for the building and wished it removed. However, the respondent gave notice indicating its intention to do so within 15 days and giving the respondent the right to retain the building on payment of the indebtedness owing under the security agreement.  5) It is significant that the applicant's actions following the failure of Lakeland were inconsistent with the same remedy set out in ss. 36(9) and (16). As a result, the Court did not wish to be taken as having resolved either one way or the other.  6) It does not follow s. 36 either can or should be read so aggressively as to exclude every cause or claim relating to the conduct of the financer of the goods as it affects the individual with an interest in land.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to lead newly discovered evidence compromises her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She claimed that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. She sought exclusion of the evidence or a mistrial. Application for return to pre-trial steps taken by the accused, including not re-electing a judge by mistake, breach of her right to make full answer and defence. Mistrial, because the accused made strategic decisions regarding the strength of disclosure received from the Crown relating to such things as her election to trial, agreements with respect to the video taped evidence and her undertaking to give evidence in the event that charges against her were not dismissed on a defence motion following the close of the Crown’s case. The accused had made these strategic decisions to ensure that new evidence would not leak out until the trial process was complete. The defence counsel had no prior knowledge of this evidence and that until last week, neither did the immediate investigative team. Counsel acted quickly and appropriately when he learned of this new evidence. The court was satisfied that the accused had succeeded because she had made strategic choices regarding her response to the new evidence, including releasing from undertakings and agreements reached to date and that she should have a right to re- elect a judge. There was no suggestion that Crown disclosure was incomplete or that the complainant had been prejudiced. The trial judge made a significant decision regarding the time it would take for the Crown to retry the case, which was a significant step in the right of the accused to participate in the defence discussions with the Crown counsel prior to the trial. The Crown has made it clear that it will not adduce the evidence until after the trial, at which point all relevant and admissible evidence will be adduced. It is not necessary to show non-disclosure; rather actual prejudice must also be demonstrated."

While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not meet the sufficiency of claim. The AGC argued that the defendant's conviction and seizure of property in 1996 did not create a cause of action because the plaintiff did not attack the validity of the 1996 warrant and restraint orders. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's amendment does not meet his claim for damages. While it is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the defendants' pleadings. 2) The amendments do not add nothing to the Statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.  3) It is well settled that the test under Rule 14.25(1) is that the application will not be granted unless the action is 'obviously unsustainable'. In considering an application to strike pleading it is not the court's function to try the issues but rather to decide if there are issues to be tried. The power to strike pleadings is to be used sparingly and where the action raises substantial issues it should not be struck."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","The parties have three children. They have a shared parenting arrangement. The petitioner cohabitates with a woman who is employed full-time. She anticipates an income of $19,211 with union dues. The parties agree that the meeting is without prejudice. The respondent seeks an order for interim exclusive possession of the family home. HELD: 1) The parties have joint custody of the children. The issues include parenting, child support and spousal support.  2) The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. In all scenarios the children are in shared parenting. It assumes the petitioner has a child support obligation for three children as $1,547 per month and the respondent's obligation is $358 per month. While they may have reached an agreement on a number of issues, they did not reach agreement on all issues. The Court concluded that settlement privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of the issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties.  3) The Court reviewed the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester required that unless all of the issue had been resolved, privilege continues. The respondents did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and indicated they would not do so until ruled on its admissibility. There was a need and ability to pay. 4) The petitioner shall pay spousals of $500 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. 5) The court reviewed the monthly cashflow of the petitioner and noted that the SSAG calculation would range from a low of $36 per month to a high of $527 per month depending on the circumstances at hand. It is premature at this point to make any determination as to whether the respondent remains under employed. Whether the respondent should be employed at something which is 40 hours per week year round is an issue which will be left to the pre-trial conference."
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. The Crown called a counsellor who testified that her mother, sister, brother and girlfriend flatly contradicted the complainant as to the time she said the acts took place. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant's credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then was whether the admission of the hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After considering the entire record, it was concluded that the appellant's evidence was admissible."

The significant income of the applicant is a factor to be taken into consideration. 2)The applicant did not establish that the claims for recreation and the university fund were expenses that were 'special' or 'extra-ordinary'. 3)The respondent was responsible for 2/3 of the nanny and child care costs which were justified pursuant to s7(1)(c) of the guidelines.","The only issue to be determined in this application was the amount of monthly maintenance to be paid by the respondent to the applicant as support for their child who was born on September 30, 1986. Both parties were medical practitioners and each enjoyed significant income. HELD: 1)The applicant was to be responsible for approximately 2/3 of the monthly expenses. The less income tax benefit available was to the respondent who earned approximately $180,000. The higher the income the applicant was entitled to, the greater the contribution to the child support fund available. 2)The respondent was to pay maintenance on an annual income of $150,000 or the sum of $1,076.00 per month.  3)The child support claims for recreation and a university fund are expenses that are special or extra-ordinary.

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an    non- aboriginal right. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed on the basis that the Court erred when it concluded that the offences with which the accused were charged did not relate to commercial fishing, but applied whether the fishing was for domestic consumption or for commercial purposes. The Court found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6, based on the standard defence of aboriginal right; it ordered the defence to revise its Brief in light of the issue which was argued at trial."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appealed his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible. A new trial was ordered. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and argued before the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may well have resulted. 2)The appellant's statement could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police. There was no evidence to indicate that statements made made by Chow attended at the police station and gave the information. The statements made in the voir dire could not be made involuntary. 3)Had there been a determination of admissibility by the trial judge as to whether or not the HighwayTraffic Act obligation to give a report to the Police renders any statement made during the report involuntary, the statement made by Mr. Chow would have been admissible in criminal proceedings.  4)The Court of Appeal, in the case of R. v.; Pelletier, 1995 CanLII 3923 (SK CA), directed a new Trial."
8_1999canlii12948.txt,"FIAT. The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

Whatever duty was due by her was to the respondent. She was not required to take any action or to refrain from doing anything. No independent relationship existed between the respondent and the Law Firm when the documents were received.

He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant Government of Saskatchewan tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan.

The defendant objected the defendant had not treated it fairly in awarding the contract to Nielsen Ashdown. HELD: The action was dismissed. The implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist. The person who invites the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. The privilege clause entitles him to consider all relevant factors, such as the amount of each tender, the experience and capabilities of the tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project, in determining who should get the contract.

8_2006skqb274.txt,"DIGEST The appellants were convicted of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was $69,000. HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a Queen's Bench trial judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and obstructing inspectors.

The Court of Appeal reduced the maximum fines to a fixed amount and suspended the time for payment pending an enquiry. The Appeal Court found that the sentence was not demonstrably unfit and that the fine should not be taken as a mere licence fee for illegal activity."

HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. 2) The accused did not contribute to the delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until her ready to have the matter rescheduled for June 14, 2006.

Evidence was led by the accused that she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The applicant sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties had an agreement that they would share joint custody of their two children, with the primary responsibility being to pay child support based on the income of the wife. The husband opposed the application on the grounds that he was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. He argued that his RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support as it is a recurring income figure over the past four years and was not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III. The applicant asked to have the amount of child support adjusted for inflation and the spousal support and should be deducted as an adjustment pursuant to Schedule III, but the Respondent transferred to the applicant by way of RRSP rollover $40,000 and waived her entitlement of spousals support. The previous variation order was a consent order which was approved by the court and was in effect until the date of the last order. The court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that order or its terms in any event. The current circumstances were not reasonable to require the Court to look beyond the respondent's line 150 income for child support purposes. The respondent's contribution to the children's financial support is modest and there is no reason to decrease it."
8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.",The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found enough merit in the applicants' arguments to warrant granting leave to appeal. The issue of merits was not the issue of the initial decision but of the later stages of the action. The issues were determined to be relevant to the resolution of the matter.
8_2011skpc3.txt,"The accused asserted that his rights to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached because the police officer did not bring a list of lawyers to the accused's attention and the accused did not have access to it. The officer may not have drawn the presence of a telephone book to the accused's attention. The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel. Alternatively, the accused failed to indicate a desire to exercise his right to counsel.","The accused is charged with consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the other count on the Information, which alleged impaired operation of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused abandoned his Charter application under ss. and thereof. 1)Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b)to be informed of that right; and (c)to have the validity of the detention determined by habeas corpus and to be released if the detention is not lawful. 2)In R. v. Ryland, 2010 SCC 36, the accused alleged a breach of his rights to counsel under s. 10(b)of the Charter. As well, he had claimed that his rights under the Charter against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained had been breached. 3)The Court reviewed the relevant authorities and found that at no point was there evidence that there was a waiver of the right to reasonable opportunity. The officer had no involvement with the accused in respect to the issue of choice of counsel and ensuring the accused had ample time for that to occur because that would normally be the duty of the police officer as investigator. 4)The self-incriminating evidence against the accused was excluded from the evidence. The accused did not ask for more time for anything nor to be left alone to decide what to do."
8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning the applicants' physical and mental health and the Court's observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. 2) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Corrections Service declining a housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in a housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. The true character of the remedies being sought by the applicants is a writ of certioraris, miorari, prohibition or mandamus (a writ of writ in aid of habas corpus) and these remedies fall outside the Exclusive jurisdiction of The Federal Court through a review process such as judicial review. 3) In the unique circumstances of this case, with the consent of both parties and the respondent not really taking issue with the applicant's request, the Court allowed the applicant to make submissions to the Court on his behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument both inmates had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the argument. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants's situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision."
9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (Dow Chemical). Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992 she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff now suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. She is also alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. Dow Chemical denies the allegations. The statement of claim makes no allegation of the plaintiff's damages caused by the defendant, The Dow Chemical Company, and more particularly by any culpable conduct on the part of that defendant."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The deceased's surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children pursuant to the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. SGI appealed the decision. HELD: The death benefit was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the respondent the death benefits payable to her as a surviving spouse and for the two children in accordance with the directions of the Court of Queen's Bench. 1)The deceased was entitled to receive a lump sum payment of $603.25 per week for 14 days. 2)SGI was not entitled to use the formula in s.136(1) to calculate the deceased's death benefit.  3)The only income replacement benefit that the Act could refer to is that provided by s. 136(1). The 'income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 is a different statutory creature than the 'incomereplacement benefit' in Division 4. The meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis."
9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.",The accused was convicted of dangerous driving causing death. He was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. The defence sought a sentence in the lower end of the range for a sentence of 18 months. HELD: The accused was given a conditional sentence. The Court found that the sentence should be served in the community. 1)It was difficult to understand how the trauma of the accident could not have altered the accused's driving habits to prevent speeding offences. These convictions must be viewed as an aggravating circumstance requiring some emphasis on specific deterrence. 2)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to drive in normal fashion resulted in the fatality or contributing factor. The accused had a minor youth record of 18 years. 3)The Court sentenced the accused to 12 months community service. 4)The sentence was reduced to 18 months probation.
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act which:(a)restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner;(b)rests the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation to the Action; and(d)restrorbs the respondent's from releasing any funds received by the petitioner pending the petitioner's application or further court order.HELD: The respondent's application was allowed. The court imposed a restraining order on the petitioner. It ordered that the sum of $40,000 be sufficient security for the claim under the Act. The order was to be paid in installments of $1,000. The respondent argued that he had never had assets of significant value and the court agreed that it had insufficient evidence upon which it could reasonably conclude that if the respondent acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. The only requirement was that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the claim. A restraining order was not granted in this case because the respondent had not met the tests that govern the granting of an interlocutory injunction."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255 and 253 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding that there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial, in finding the appellant was not in care and control of the vehicle because the appellant rendered it inoperable by removing its keys. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge's findings of fact concerning the essential elements of health and control and impairment by alcohol are supported by the evidence. Direct evidence confirms that the accused's condition did not change for the period that he was in the driver's seat and if impairment is indeed proven, which is the next issue will deal with. The Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s.258 of the Code, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same. That evidence consisted of the testimony of his three friends whose evidence related to the appellant having abstained from consuming alcoholic beverages in their presence and not to whether he had care or control of his vehicle during time frame No. 1. It was concluded in Hodge's Case (1838), 1838, 1838 CanLII (FOREP), 168 E.R. 1136. This rule does not apply in the instant case for there is some direct evidence concerning the ability of the motor vehicle to the point where he had stopped inexplicably his vehicle in the middle of an intersection in the way of traffic, in drive and running, with his foot on the brake while sleeping soundly. His ability to make appropriate decisions with respect to driving was clearly impaired. The inference made by the judge is one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the matter and therefore should not be interfered with."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders. The defendants ask that the Court exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. They also seek an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. The plaintiffs can easily discern if the defendants are breaching that order. At this stage, no breach has been alleged. The court has the inherent jurisdiction to order severance for purposes preliminary to trial as well as trial.  1) The defendants acknowledge that they have developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants’ obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that trust. The Court reviewed the relevant Queen’s Bench Rules and found there was no bifurcation of liability and the plaintiffs’ claim had merit. 2) There is a clear severability between the threshold and the consequential issue of damages and there is no contract of employment. The entitlement to sue for the disgorgement of profits hinges on whether Wolff, as its former employee, was in a position of fiduciary, such as trustee and cestui que trust or solicitor and client. The fiduciaries relationship must be found on the specific facts proven in the case. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele will be relevant only upon finding of liability. 3) The plaintiffs are not disadvantaged in their claim by allowing the defendants to withhold their work product at this stage. The plaintiff already has an immediate remedy should the defendants poach their clients. There was no breach of the confidentiality and non-competition agreement."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as 'Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment for hearing of an application pursuant to the Act for leave to commence an action. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed.  1) Rule 5(1) was applied. Rule 318 and 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court were applied. 2) There was limited evidence with respect to the value of the property and no evidence from the licensed realtor who was charged with listing the property as to the steps taken. The amount owing under the mortgage was described as being the arrears of principal, $29,994.98 and interest arreaars. There was no order from the court authorizing pre-leave costs nor any evidence as to why the court might consider pre- leave costs.  3) Rule 4(1)(a) was amended to include a caveat that the plaintiff was not to submit an offer to purchase the mortgaged property for the sum of $35,000."

When asked if he wished to contact a lawyer, the accused had responded in the negative, noting that there would 'probably be one down around there anyway.' statement excluded from evidence; the accused's s. 10(b) rights had been violated. It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon, unlawful possession of a weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008. The Crown had sought admission of the accused's statements made during the course of his detention, first on s. 87 Liquor Control Act violation for public drunkenness and then on the more serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the complainant as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and right to have counsel then and there before he made any statement to the police. He was asked if he understood his rights and his reply was muttered and hard to interpret. The police officer testified that he was simply too drunk to remember what happened that day and he did not intend to be cooperative witness. HELD: The accused's mind wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial and he was unable to understand his rights. His lack of a formal vocation to make a statement equated to a complete decline in his ability to make informed decisions about what to do next. Although he may have been aware of his rights at the time of making the statement, he remained focused on the present and his immediate right to counsel before making any statement, which was the gateway of the Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction."
9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for the court was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should have been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the accused had the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code.  1) In the case of R. v. Lepaskowski, [1960] S.C.R. 3, the court distinguished between the offences, such as assault or dangerous driving, the offence is made out regardless of the consequences of the act but the consequences can be used to aggravate liability for the offence. 2) It is very apparent that by the commission of the assault that Mr. Cwynar suffered bodily harm. As a result, and at a minimum, the Crown has established that Ms. Fayant must Be convicted of assault causing bodily harm (Aggravated Assault). 3) With respect to the charge for aggravated assault, it is apparent that the defendant struck the accused in the facial area with the candle holder. There is no suggestion that she gave him a backhand. This is simply not believable. The injuries were significant to the eye area and significant bruising following this injury."
9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: 1) The trial judge erred in finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver's seat is deemed to have care and control of the vehicle. The only thing the accused added to his viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This does not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent. 2) The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings.  3) The evidence at the third trial was different. The officer testified that he was so tired that he felt he was in danger on the road. The accused was simply mistaken as to the amount of alcohol he consumed that day or was deliberately misleading the Court in an attempt to defeat this charge. 4) The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilizer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beers while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. The Crown appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. 5) The accused did not establish an abuse of process as a result of the fact there were three trials."

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The Matrimonial Property Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated.

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","The defendant appealed a jury trial decision awarding damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision. The trial judge had limited the amount of expert opinion evidence available to the jury as a result of the plaintiff's injuries. Since liability was admitted by the defendant, the jury trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The evidence of the past loss of income was so extensive as to be impermissible. 2)The trial judge clearly failed to consider the future loss of future earnings, which was the subject of much debate in the trial. The jury was only permitted to look at the present value of the income and to consider its future loss. 3)The plaintiff was not seeking to invade the privacy and dignity of others as she had been employed by her employer for several years. She was merely seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of an expert witness. The evidence of her previous employment as a nurse was irrelevant. 4)No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was demonstrated but in the circumstances of this case the award for damages could not be determined simply by totalling the sum of periodic payments. The judge restricted the testimony of a chartered accountant or forensic accountant on the basis that he was not entitled to rely upon the evidence of a doctor. 5)The court rejected the appellant's challenge to the use of sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries. The court found that the respondent's post injury work record and the fact that she was still employed at her pre-accident employer did not disqualify her from taking part in any kind of jury trial."

For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.","The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He claimed that his breaks and breaks were for his meal and were part of a 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff from his employment without notice. The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to longer breaks and a 40 minute break for lunch. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified. The defendant had satisfied the onus with respect to six factors. The first was whether the employer was justified in dismissing the plaintiff. The second was whether there was a reasonable excuse for the dismissal. The Court found that the defendant had failed to follow the company's rules. As a result, the Court awarded the plaintiff $15,000 in damages and ordered the plaintiff to vacate his employment for a period of time which included periods of unpaid break and periods of 40 and 45 minutes respectively. The court considered these factors and found that it was reasonable for the defendant to believe that breaks and overtime were not sufficiently serious to justify termination. The third and most serious issue was whether or not the defendant's onus was on the court to prove that there was just cause for dismissal."

It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction.

The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The respondent was acquitted on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argues that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1) The applicant failed to demonstrate that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance. The respondent submits that the total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September of 1996 and it was merely happenstance that the maintenance order was roughly equivalent to one-half of that amount. 2) The court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant’s anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor andclient costs. In this situation, however, it is appropriate for the Court to fix the costs to the applicant in lump sum."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident.

The sole issue on the appeal was if any extra dependant benefits payable under the Act were payable pursuant to s.146(3).

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence. The stewards were not vested with the sole authority to determine whether there was interference at the gate. 4)Knight v. Indian Head School Division set out that the existence of a general duty to act fairly on the part of a public authority depends on three factors: the nature of the decision, the relationship between the body and the individual, and the effect of the decision on the individual. 5)A miscarriage of justice occurred because the Commission did not give adequate or any notice to the applicants and failed to give them an opportunity to make submissions. The decision of the Commission to refuse to give the applicants notice of the hearing was patently unreasonable. Their rights were affected by the decision. Bibeault was distinguishable. 6)The applicants were awarded costs.","The applicants were the owners of two horses involved in a $15,000stakes race that comprised the sixth race on that day's race card and featured a field of eight horses.

HELD: The Court held that it was fundamental that the party introducing opinion evidence based upon hypothetical facts has the burden of establishing those facts in evidence. Impairment is an issue of fact which the trial judge must decide on the evidence. If evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt, then the accused must be acquitted. The Court found that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired to some degree by alcohol or drugs.  1)No mechanical failure of any of the three cars caused or contributed to the accident; however, the Plymouth Caravelle, operated by the deceased, had been badly rusted and its structural integrity was severely rusted. 2)The accused was found to have been operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level in excess of 220 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood when the accident occurred.  3)She was found not guilty on all the remaining counts.  4)The Court found her guilty of criminal negligence in failing to obtain a blood sample at the time of the second test."
b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was 3 years old when her mother died. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later. The Agency found that N.D. was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining the children. Child Abuse and Child Stress Mitigation Test were both assessed as being of concern to the Agency. A Child Stress and Substantive Abuse Test was also assessed. In relation to the third child, the Agency determined that it was appropriate to enter the finding under the 22(2)(b) of the Child Abuse Act and on the basis of the risk to the children caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately. An assessment was held in April 2002 and the matter was adjourned to May 3, 2002 for a Disposition Hearing. Counsel for the Agency continued to advise how they arrived at their conclusions based on all the evidence. HELD: The children were in need of protective services and the Agency provided support and counseling. Counsel provided expert opinion evidence in the area of parental capacity. Counsel prepared to consent to any change in the assessment."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application. The issue was whether the Youth Court judge in Provincial Court had the jurisdiction to hear and determine the accused's application for judicial interim release. HELD: The jurisdiction for determination of interim judicial release of a young person charged with murder under the Youth Criminal Justice Act rests solely with the superior court of criminal jurisdiction, which is the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan.","The accused made an application under s. 515 of the Criminal Code and ss. 33 (8) and 13(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for interim judicial release pending his preliminary inquiry. The Provincial Court declined the accused's application on the grounds that he's presence in the community awaiting trial would erode the public's confidence in the administration of justice. The Crown asked for a determination of two preliminary issues: 1) whether the Youth Court judge in the Provincial Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine the application for judicial interim release; and 2) if so, whether this honourable court has jurisdiction to conduct review of the youth court judge's decision. HELD: The matter of jurisdiction under the old Young Offender’s Act had now been reviewed by the Youth Courts Bench and it was satisfied that the Parliament of Canada made a change in jurisdiction for an offence of this nature from that as provided in the Young Offenders Act. The issue then becomes for a young person charged with an offence set out in s. 469 of the Code who is charged with second degree murder. The jurisdiction for the determination of interim judicial releases rests solely with the superior court of justice in the Province of Saskatchewan."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days. Section 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which the IRB is derived. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than half the time. If a claimant has proved on a balance of probabilities that the promised employment reflects his or her earning reality, a poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning reality"
b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. The primary residence was with the mother. The parties did not seek periodic or lump sum support but rather a lump sum payment to cover tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support but expressed concern that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. The father argued that he did not earn enough to pay such an expense and that the mother did not need it. The daughter claimed that she was not included in the numbered company because she was ill at the time and not paying attention. She claimed that the home was operated from joint family account and was owned by the father and his siblings. Ordering the children joint custody, that day-to-day primary care shall be with the daughter and the mortgage balance was set at $650 per month. There was no basis for an unequal division as listed in s. 13 of the Act. The evidence of the mother's extensive involvement in the operation of the property indicated that it was a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. The children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. They will have to give notice of the activity and the cost of their tuition."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community's highway. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked, contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(3) do not include an ATV and even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive anATV on the road. It was a vehicle of the wrong type or class to get a license. The accused was not charged with any offence under s. 11 since his ATV was not registered to the Crown and the Crown did not have insurance on it."
b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the father's maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the daughters were still children of the marriage, that he was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The father applied for variation of child support in the amount of $3,644. He found that there was no agreement in 1997 to pay specified or other maintenance. The mother took no steps to collect or account for those expenses and as result it would be inequitable to require the father to pay them. The trial judge found that this was not the case. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The quality of the parent/child relationship by itself rarely determines the matter. Even if the circumstances as a whole were construed as a unilateral withdrawal by the daughters, the high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met."
b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

In dealing with count 4 (the defect) he learned only of the charge concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction.

b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The Court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The plaintiff had been the director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) for four years and had been appointed director in 2002. During that time, the VTH also served as the teaching and research facility for veterinarian students at the University of Saskatchewan. In addition, the plaintiff was the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace for the students. The court accepted the defence of the defendants in a provisional order for damages. The Court held that it was impossible for a director of a public institution to be defamed because of the impugned wording of the employee's grievance and because the employer was an active participant in the harassment himself. It found that the employer's intentional actions amounted to intentional interference with the reputation of an employee and it must be brought to the court's attention."
b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"Civil Law – Custody and Access – GrievanceCivil Procedure – Admissibility of Evidence – Counseling and Child Taxation – Affidavits – Estudiantes – Matrimonial Property – Estate Planning – Matriarchal Property – Child Support The respondent's counsel exhibited a letter to the petitioner's counsel in which he outlined a detailed offer of settlement. HELD: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute.  1) Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. The respondent exhibited to his affidavit that he intended to forward without prejudice a proposal to attempt to settle the parties parenting and child support matters. This is gamesmanship and nothing more. Gamesmanship fouls that which the policy seeks to promote. Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of a few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish that it is impossible to refuse a proposal, such a proposal is irrelevant. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could later be used to their detriment. A party cannot unilaterally waive privilege even on a proposal he made because it is not his to waive. 2) With respect to the respondent's proposal, the Court ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and in respect of the notice of objection payable within 15 days. The petitioner shall have costs of $500."

The accused took no position. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. Making an order for video-conferencing for non- participating persons was not permitted because the Court had no control over the policing of the courtroom in Ontario. It would set a dangerous precedent that could result in multiple applications being made in future trials by numerous interested parties in different jurisdictions over which the Court had no control.","The applicant Government of Saskatchewan has brought a motion before myself as trial judge for an order permitting a live audio/video broadcast of the trial set to proceed in April 2013 from a Court of Queen's Bench courtroom in Saskatoon in Saskatchewan to a courtroom in a court house in the Greater Toronto area, Ontario, for the exclusive benefit of the family of the deceased. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is not prepared to accept the argument that courtroom in Toronto where only Bert's family would be in attendance is just an extension of the courtroom in Saskatchewan let alone another province. It is a distinct courtroom in another province over which this Court has no jurisdiction or control. The Court is very concerned about the possible ramifications of granting an order in such a fashion.

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent argued that the application had substantially expired before the service of the initial notice of intention. The limitation period had been suspended on the filing of the February 28, 2006 Notice of intention and remains suspended. The applicant obtained a perpetual right to commence enforcement proceedings without regard to any limitation periods. The purpose of the Farm Security Act is to prevent mortgagees from foreclosing on farmers who have a reasonable possibility of and who are making sincere and reasonable effort to meet their obligations. The application for an order under s. 11(1) was made in February of 2009. The notice of extension having expired on February of 2013 was the limitation clock began to run again. The reason the legislature provided a suspension of limitation time in s. 22 is obvious. The legislative intent behind s. 9(1)(d) was to ensure that mortgagees would have available to them the full limitation period they would otherwise have had but for the infringement on that time by the requirements of the Limitations Act. It would be manifest injustice to mortgagees if their limitation periods to commence an action expired within the 150-day period before they could make an application or because the Court, on the making of an application, refused an order permitting the commencement of an action. This is the case in every case where a mortgagee makes an application with respect to a mortgage on a farm land, the court may, on any terms that it considers a just and equitable order that s. 8(3) does not apply."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay both child and spousal support and further for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.HELD: 1) The original support order was correct at the time it was made. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) In approaching variation, the respondent needs to show material change in circumstances having occurred. The ability to vary an interim order has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In the result, the Court is not prepared to expunge any of the arreears prior to 2013."

Appeal dismissed; the appellant did not commit a fraud in obtaining payment under the policy; she made no wilfully false statement. The failure of the appellant to disclose the sister's testimony to the insurer in the face of her uncertainty about whether or not her brother-in-law had anything to do with the fire was not fraud.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs.

The issue was whether the Minister of Education was required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the Cape Breton Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The school board submitted there was an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost.

c_1996canlii472.txt,"The plaintiff held a mortgage on a house destroyed by a suspicious fire. At the time of the fire there were two insurance policies in place for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff. One was placed by the mortgagors with the defendant to protect both their interests and those of the plaintiff. When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. Finding for the plaintiff, that the defendant has not satisfied the heavy burden of producing clear and satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff, through its employees, acted wilfully and knowingly to claim the benefit of coverage to which it was not entitled.","This was an action involving a contest between two insurance companies. The defendant, Canada Trustco, had placed two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The plaintiff failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. The insurance policy was placed with the Co-operators General Insurance Company and protected both the plaintiff's interests and the mortgagee. The Court found that in the context of the contract between the insurance companies, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged."

Although a statement of claim was served on the defendant, it's insurer was advised by the plaintiff's counsel that she would not proceed to judgment except on 10 days written notice. More than six months later plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to the defendant's insurer giving 10 days notice. This letter was not seen by him although he was in the process of putting together material for a solicitor to file a defence. The defendant had always advised the plaintiff that it intended to defend. No Notice of Intention, required for default judgment if six or more months had elapsed since the last step in the proceeding, was ever given to the defendant before the filing of the default judgment. Allowing the application and setting aside the default judgment, that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse on the part of the defendant for not filing the defence. Sending a letter to the insurer does not satisfy the requirement of filing a Notice of Intention to proceed. The fact that the prothonotary did not object to the request for default judgment without the Notice is immaterial.","This was an application for an order setting aside a default judgment entered against the defendant municipality in February 1996. The plaintiff had filed an affidavit claiming that a mudslide had occurred during road work which had caused extensive damage to her property. The defendant had hired an insurance adjuster to do the work and had received no notice of intention to proceed. When the default judgment was entered into, the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment on the basis that it was issued by the Prothonotary and not by the court. The applicant submitted that there was a fairly arguable defence and a reasonable excuse for not filing the defence. Granting the default order, that the defendant had not complied with Civil Procedure Rule 3.04, or Rule 12.06, and that the plaintiff should have taken the matter to court to seek default judgment.

c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant plead guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000. He was sentenced to 5 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's affidavit evidence was inadequate.

c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff is entitled to damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her last employment with the defendant, plus vacation pay at 6% per annum. 1)It is not always easy to find employment in an area where there is an abundance of employment opportunities and an over abundance of qualified people who are willing to work at a modest rate as illustrated by the case of the respondent. 2)It seems to me that an employer would put such an unreasonable proposition to an employee of the obvious high calibre of the plaintiff with a proven track record with her employer. It is also significant that the four months that she had previously spent by way of maternity leave was not deducted froth her period of employment when her vacation pay benefit was increased to six percent after five years of employment. It appears to the employer wanted to get rid of her. 3)The defendant put forth a 'take it or leave it' proposition to her and it was one that she obviously could not accept. Unquestionably, it is not intended as an opportunity for the employee to be seeking new employment. In this case the plaintiff had no notice of these changes until the letter of June 1997. 4)The plaintiff was awarded prejudgment interest on the amount from July 14/97."
c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they have complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they had not within the required time frame meet the requirements set out in the legislation. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The application for relief was dismissed. 1)The defendant provided a letter of commitment to the plaintiffs. It did not require that it be forwarded to it from the financial institution nor required that the plaintiffs provide a such letter. In the interval, the plaintiffs committed themselves to the Farm Credit Corporation, who as it turned out was not prepared to provide such a letter, and they also had incurred liabilities with Farm Credit Corp for loan processing fees and solicitor costs. Prior to the May 1, 1997 letter the plaintiffs, had complied with an original contractual obligation to 'provide' a letter to it a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. Prior, the plaintiff had complied in the alternative with respect to the mortgage application. 2)The letter from the defendant's solicitors was the first time a request was made for a letter addressed to it by the defendant and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on them. The plaintiffs acted on them and received the letter in the form of an unconditional and unequivocal letter. 3)The plaintiff counter-claimed for costs of the action. 4)The Court declined to provide a copy of the letter to the defendant. It was clear that the defendant was not seeking to comply with the Act's requirements. The letter did not contain the terms of the offer the defendant received from the third party, but simply advised of the price in contravention of s 27(1)."

HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm in question was in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files. The Law Society of Saskatchewan in response to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in MacDonald Estate v. Martin found that there was a strong inference that lawyers who work together share confidences. The law firm had put in place many of the screening measures suggested by the Guidelines in the Code. The lawyer swore an affidavit in this application that she has not had any conversations with anyone associated with the former client's files and that she will not discuss those files with anyone within the firm. HELD: The evidence filed by the applicant was satisfied that all the screenings were taken so quickly that they may have not actually occurred by the lawyer. There was no real risk to the lawyer who would be prejudiced if she continued to act so long as the screen was in place. There were numerous independently verifiable steps which the applicant had taken to ensure that no disclosure would occur. The instructions to firm members of the restrictions being placed on all firm members regarding the conflicting files carried implicit notice of sanctions in the event the policy was not adhered to. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information had occurred or would occur in the law office.

The third party argued the application essentially sought a contempt citation and should be directed to trial. The second issue concerned the respondent's opposition to the applicant's request for leave to move to Alberta, arguing that the move will be tantamount to a denial of access. The applicant had been prohibited in a 1998 order from removing the children from Saskatchewan without a court order, absent consent.HELD: 1)The issue of the payments was directed to trial and pre-trial conference to be held in January. 2)The mother was granted leave to move the children to Alberta. Their primary residence was to continue to be with her. She was encouraged to attain self-sufficiency. Access was to be maintained and the mother was ordered to return the children to Saskatchewan for purposes of allowing the respondent to exercise access in accordance with existing orders. Additional access was granted provided he picked up and returned the children to the applicant's residence. 3)The 1998 interim order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home was not changed. The applicant was at liberty to rent the home. 4)The applicant was directed to take all reasonable steps to sell the recreational trailer in her possession and to pay the sale proceeds to the bank to discharge the lien and the balance into court.

The third party argued that the payment was fraudulent and should be directed to trial. HELD: The respondent was directed to pay $10,000 into court and the costs of the trial would be fixed at trial. 1)The applicant had interim possession and exclusive use of the matrimonial home and contents pursuant to a 1998 order. The Court designed the primary residence of the two children to be with the applicant and the respondent was granted access every second weekend. By subsequent order made December 1998 the father was granted additional access to include Thursday or Monday when the weekend falls on statutory holiday and the applicant was prohibited from removing the children from Saskatchewan without court order, absent consent. 2)The court granted leave to remove the children to Medicine Hat; their primary residence will thereby continue. The status quo as to access should also be maintained: access was ordered to be allowed by the respondent for the duration of December 17 to December 23 and the children were to attend a family ski vacation. 3)Costs of the application were reserved to the court for the trial judge. Costs of the sale of the home (approximately $9,800) were reserved at the time of the judgment. 4)There was no obligation on the applicant to pay any costs to the bank. The court ensured that all proceeds from the sale would be reserved to pay off the mortgage, rent, rent and any other items reserved from the bank for rent or sales.  5)The Court ensured that the property was suitable for recreational use and that the applicant would have exclusive possession of it from the respondent.

c_2002skca122.txt,Appeals of sentence and conviction on the grounds the transcripts of court proceedings were not available; the court would not subpoena certain witnesses on his behalf; his state of mind when he made the telephone calls exonerated him. HELD: The appeals against conviction and sentence were dismissed. The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. The sentence appeal was moot since it was limited to time served while awaiting trial. The Court would have found the sentence to be fit in any event.,"The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. All of the members of the Court read the notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing his arguments. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The Court found that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant and irrelevant to the charges against you, being too remote in time, being unrelated to the charge which were the subject matter of trial, and being unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury. 2) The sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial."
c_2002skca74.txt,"The appellant was unsuccessful in Queen's Bench in having his suspension and probation as a medical resident rescinded or to prohibit the Investigation Committee, which met on approximately seven occasions and interviewed seven witnesses, from taking further action. The Chambers judge refused to grant relief, finding the issues to be academic in nature and within the exclusive jurisdiction of the University, but ruled his supervisor should be removed from the Committee because of an apprehension of bias. The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. 1)The material did not meet the test for the admission of fresh evidence. It simply restated what was at issue and found to have had no effect. 2)There was no tenable basis for interfering. The remedies are discretionary. 3)The Court was not prepared to grant the relief in any event, given the long delay in seeking recourse. The initial concern was bias and jurisdiction. The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations. Proceedings should not be allowed to be fragmented and should be allowed to run their course so the court has a complete record from the tribunals below. Certiorari should not be granted where there is a right of appeal, except in exceptional circumstances.","The medical resident pursuing certification as a specialist in orthopaedic surgery appealed both his suspension and probation as medical resident rescinded and a prohibition of the Investigation Committee established to look into the matter from taking further action.

The appellant's union (PAIRS) brought an application for an order prohibiting the committee from proceeding further and ordering him reinstated as resident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V.  There was no tenable basis for interfering with the Chambers judge's disposition of the application. The remedies prayed for are discretionary by nature, the writs of grace and the result is not so plainly wrong as to warrant intervention. There were other avenues of appeal available, however the appellant's application was premature.

c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. In 1996, the respondent purchased a tractor from his uncle and sold it to the petitioner for $2,200. The petitioner had no income from the farm since the separation. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years he has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The father stated that he had no interest in any equipment owned by the respondent. 2) The respondent sold his trailer and the proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the farm. 3) The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. She should bear no responsibility for the payments made and the Court declined to take them into account. 4) The Court weighed the oral testimony of several witnesses, including the petitioner, while also considering the content of large number of documents. The majority of the documents showed that the respondent paid monies on account of fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance. 5) There were several other pieces of machinery which the respondent claimed should be taken into account, as well as a partial exemption in respect to Yamaha snowmobile. The Court found that the father owned the tractor and that it was subject to distribution. The amount of monies owing to the respondent was $43,000. These were on-going expenses and related to the farm operation. As the respondent had not obtained any income from his farm, any of which could be attributed to him, the monies were to be paid to the family home and the items were not to be taxed."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","The Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not 'prepared to make the agreement retroactive'. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The employer was a merchant. His products are priced in such a way as to reflect in part the labour costs involved in delivering them to the public. 2) The Board denied the parties natural justice and procedural fairness in respect of the wage retroactivity to employees who had left the employ before the contract was concluded by order of the Board. 3) The importance of a wage rise, retroactive and rather substantial if viewed as a percentage would seem to be prejudicial. 4) The Court did not find that the errors made here were so severe as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the Courts."
c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who served in the Canadian Armed Forces (Criminal Law); (b) Dependent Resident Class; and (c) Dependant Non-Resident Class. The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' pursuant to legislation enacted July 31, 2000. The claim is based on acts or omissions occurring prior to 1953 are statute barred by virtue of s. 24 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act or by predecessor legislation to the same effect and therefore cannot constitute a cause of action. The Crown also alleges that the plaintiffs are statute-barred from receiving the Survivors's Pensions that they seek. HELD: The action was dismissed as statute barred. 1) There are a number of limitations issues, some of which are common and others that will be individual to the class members. There is no suggestion Indian War Veterans were denied the right to apply for veteran's benefits. The issue in this case is their allegation that they were not properly informed of their rights. 2) The Court should be reluctant to deny a class member his or her day in court. 3) The test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as that in England, if there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. The circumstances of this case are different. There are no suggestion Indians were denied their right to vote in the 2012 election. 4) The accused are entitled to the benefits they claim in the proposed class. 5) The claim in this action is a claim of negligence, misrepresentation and breach of warranties. 6) The plaintiff's awareness of the symptoms in 1976 and her suit in 1993 could not simply be due to lack of a medical-legal report. There was nothing before the court to indicate that she had such a report today. All the elements necessary for a successful class action are manifest in 1976."

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars. He wrote a cheque for $11,000 on his personal bank account knowing that the account lacked sufficient funds.

The next day, he deposited another cheque into his bank account, this time depositing and withdrawing $13k in cash. This time, the money was lost by the bank.

HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the accused's appeal was allowed. A conditional sentence was substituted in place of a 1 year conditional sentence and he was required to perform 200 hours upon probation. The court prescribed the compulsory conditions set out in s. 742.3(1) of the Criminal Code and a 200 hour community service commitment, with credit to be given in that regard for any work performed to date and 200 hours on the probation order made by the sentencing judge."

HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and, although the Crown was alleging the existence of signs of impairment and the accused offered an innocent explanation for them, there was no unexplained delay. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. The entry of a judicial stay on the impaired drive charge was not used to avoid a multiple conviction issue. Volume of consumption falls within the provisions of s. 253(b). The mechanism for doing so is the entering of judicial stays on the charge that is less serious when convicting of the more serious. The reasonableness of the conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered by virtue of the fact that the evidence is sufficiently clear to resolve the impairment charge without any error of law. The decision of the Provincial Court judge was set aside rather than being set aside by the trial judge."
c_2005skqb450.txt,"The petitioner seeks an order for ongoing child support based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","The Court dismissed the application. It found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The respondent had made an application for ongoing child maintenance based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: The respondent was ordered to pay the sum of $90 per month in child maintenance and to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. The Guideline amount was the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study."
c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy in September 2005.

c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by two of the plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, who were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in a vehicle driven by the other plaintiff, Maria Johansson. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. The parties were encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs. HELD: Both conditions were satisfied and the defendant was entitled to use the Releases to defend against the two plaintiffs who had already been compensated for their injuries by Citadel. To allow their action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. The defendant had passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim had a real chance of success. They had failed to do so. The motion for summary judgement was granted and the claims of both Steven and Johansson were hereby dismissed."
c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning. The accused did not clearly indicate that the legal advice he received was inadequate or suggest that he wanted to consult with another lawyer. The officer was justified in assuming that the accused was satisfied with the legal advice he had received. The Crown stayed the impaired driving count prior to the conclusion of the trial. The videotape evidence was not relevant to the .08 offence because all observations were made at roadside. The video would not have shown anything of relevance to the charge. There is no breach of the accused's rights under s. 7. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted into evidence and the accused was convicted of the .08 charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.253(1(b) and 253(3)(b). The accused blew a screening device and was taken to the detachment where samples were obtained with readings of 130 mgs and 120 mgs. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's right to counsel.  1)The absence of any evidence of legal advice could have been avoided. 2)The accused made a conscious decision to consult with Legal Aid and, by implication, did not wish to pursue his first course of action. In this situation there was no obligation on the police officer to provide the accused with a warning. This was not a situation where the accused opted not to contact legal counsel and thus waived his rights under s.10(b). 3)The destruction of video evidence could have had the effect of preventing the accused from making full answer and defence. 4)Since the accused had been allowed to call his wife from his cell phone in the police cruiser on the way to Carlyle, the investigating officers should have waited a reasonable time for her to call him back. In fact, the cell phone was taken from him on arrival at the detachment."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a blocked receiving pit. The employee suffocated after stepping onto the grain in the pit. Viterra was charged with three counts of failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failed to ensure employee health or safety. HELD: The accused was not charged with any of the counts except for the one concerning the employee who suffocated. The evidence of the person who had been made aware of the hazards was not found to be buried in the mass of documents. As the employee had been adequately instructed, trained, supervised and informed he would not have entered the receiving pit without following safety procedures; the employee was not required to enter the pit in order to prevent it from being blocked; and the accused had not demonstrated due diligence or took reasonable care in failing to supervise and supervise the employee. There was no evidence of negligence on the part of the employer as a result of the incident."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. The accused appealed his conviction on the dangerous driving charge. He argued that the trial judge failed to take into account the fact that the accused overtook the complainant, pushed her towards the side of the road and assaulted her. The complainant was not an overly cooperative witness and refused to repeat any conversation she had with the accused based on spousal privilege. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not err in not applying the de minimis non curat lex principle to the accused's driving. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the decision made by the trial court. The Court was entitled to deference in her assessment of the evidence. 1)The trial judge erred in failing to give effect to implied consent and in adopting zero tolerance. The driving must be dangerous to the public having regard to all the circumstances. The offence will only be made out if the care exhibited by the accused constitutes a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver. 2)The evidence was re-examined and it was clear that the complainant had not consented to the use of force. The location of where the incident occurred elevates the dangerous nature of the appellant's actions and the fact he drove parallel to the complainant."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a whole or in part under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act; alternatively, the maintenance award was of such a low amount that it is unconscionable and unduly harsh to bind the wife to such a provision. Awarding the wife $65,000, that the value of the matrimonial home is $400,000. This is an extremely fair and indeed an unequal division in her favor. If the court were to set aside the separation agreement it would find that there are no factors that have been established under the Act under which it is bound by the maintenance provisions, the court would have to make an order varying the terms of the agreement as the court sees fit."
d_1991canlii4322.txt,"A complaint was lodged against the applicant police officer that she had been discourteous to the victim of a sexual assault and that she had lied about being granted permission to attend a meeting held to investigate the assault. The applicant was given written notice of the substance of both allegations according to the disciplinary procedure set out in the regulations made pursuant to the Police Act, but in the space provided for the citation the notice cited only the regulation which dealt with the offense of being discourteous. A hearing before an inspector of the Police Department resulted in the applicant being found guilty of the offense of lying. She initiated a review by the Police Review Board which concluded that the section reference in the charge did not have to be accurate. The applicant brought this proceeding for judicial review and submitted that the Board's jurisdiction was limited by the citation of a particular regulation and to finding her guilty of the behaviour described in the regulation cited. Dismissing the application, that the failure to cite what the Board considered the proper offense in no way materially affected the procedural fairness of the hearings or limited the Board's jurisdiction. The applicant had complete notice of the nature of the allegations against her and was represented by counsel at the Board hearing. Certiorari will not issue for mere technical or trivial oversights and there was nothing patently unreasonable about the decision such as would warrant judicial intervention. On appeal","The police officer who was assigned to investigate two alleged assaults had been charged with a disciplinary default for which she had not been charged. She appealed the decision of the Police Review Board which found that the Regulation number used by the police officer did not correspond to the number in the police report. Dismissing the application, that the Review Board was entitled to substitute the 'proper' section number in its notice of action for a specific offence under the Police Act.

He was remanded until his sentencing. The Crown opposed the application for bail. The appellant appealed his conviction on three grounds: 1) the trial judge failed to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant by the complainant; 2) the learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to permit a cross- examination of the complainant on an audio/video cassette; 3) on an earlier contradictory statement the appellant had heard on tape without even having heard the contradictory statement.

d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute.

The plaintiff alleged that the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced a rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. 1)The defendant knew that the plaintiff did not come with a basement. It is the practice of the plaintiff to price an RTM and basement separately if a prospective purchaser seeks to have the plaintiff provide a basement as well as the RTM. 2)The plaintiff cannot accept the plaintiff's allegation that there was a common agreement or intention and mistake in the wording of the agreement. The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and I am not satisfied that therewas an agreement reached by the parties to pay interest. 3)While the plaintiff has obtained judgment for the extras, this was never in dispute and was admitted by the defendants in their statement of defence.

At issue was were whether the arbitrator applied the correct measure of damages and whether there was any evidence to support the findings of fact. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the award was confirmed. The respondent's application for enforcement of the award was granted without costs. 1)The issues were questions of fact not law. The errors complained of were the same questions referred to the arbitrator for determination. Adding the phrase 'difference in costs to the builder' did not convert the issue from one of fact to one of law. The wording on the second issue was changed slightly to read 'in his calculation as to damages awarded for increased costs of winter construction'. There was some evidence upon which the arbitrator could make a finding of fact. 2)As none of the bars set out in the Act applied the court was required by s50(3) to give judgment enforcing the award.  3)The application for costs on a solicitor and client basis was denied.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively.

The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children. The executors did not oppose the application under the Wident's Relief Act however they did put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of support.

The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial. Finally, there were no errors by the judge on any of the other grounds advanced for appeal.","Following a trial in the Supreme Court, before Justice Simon MacDonald and a jury, the appellant was convicted of four offences arising out of her operation of a motor vehicle. The appellant appealed her conviction, and raised numerous grounds of appeal. In none of these grounds did the appellant take the position that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the Youth Court judge's decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The purpose of the legislation is the same as that in R. v. Zundel (1992), [1998] SCC, 95 D.L.R. (4th) 202 (S.C.C.) but with a change in the wording of s. 102(2) to s. 107(1) meaning that the sentence has continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. 2) The legislation is not a straightforward analysis of the reasons for the decision. The broad focus on the objectives of rehabilitation and reintegration is not the same thing that led to the decision in SKC 149. The focus is on the long term consequences of a breach of the custody and community supervision order rather than on the short term consequences. The most significant issue on appeal is whether the sentence will continue to run after the completion of review under s. 103. In this case, the youth sentence was already expired as there was no breach of community supervision provisions in s. 42(1)(b) of the Code."
d_2005skqb424.txt,"FIAT: In December 2000, the medical review panel of the Workers' Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that the applicant was not fit for work. On January 2005, the Board's appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board's case management division that the applicant was fit for employment. Although the applicant has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers' compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. HELD: Whether or not the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction and consequently are a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances that might justify judicial intervention at this time have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to him because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. The application is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions of the Board's case management division and appeals committee. HELD: The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. 1) Certiorari remains a writ of grace to grant or withhold as, in the discretion of the court, circumstances suggest. The Board began to develop the view that the applicant might be fit for employment after all. The decision of the medical review panel was contrary to s. 64(2) of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. 2) The appeal to the court is determined on the issue of jurisdiction. 3) The parties are bound by the statements of principle found in Harelkin's case. Rule 669 requires a return that includes information up to and including the impugned decision and the reasons therefor. Such information has been provided in the return in this case. 4) Whether or not each of the imputed decisions was made without jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, the applicant has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. The appeal available to the applicant in the workers' compensation system is not limited to points of law, and so on appeal the Board members would be able to consider the applicant's issue of fact."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred because the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection. The defendant testified that he had just finished a police call in Cherry Brook and he had been requested by attending police officers to undergo breathalyser. The plaintiff also claimed that she had had two White Russians during the course of the evening. At issue was whether the defendants' vehicle was operating properly when it was struck by the plaintiff's vehicle and whether the plaintiff was contributory to the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1) The evidence of the lay witnesses was found to be in abeyance of the second requirement, that of competence. 2) The plaintiff did not see the police vehicle approaching the intersection until after she was admitted to the lounge, asked to call the police, and when she was taken to the detachment, she was told that the lights were in operation. The detachment was responsible for the exhibits. 3) The Court could not find any evidence that the defendant was qualified to express his opinion in his testimony. 4) There was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the officer who was clearly aware of the accident and did not follow some of the directions and recommendations in the manual."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn on April 21, 2005 had been a basis for the search. The applicant claimed the affidavit contained incomplete and misleading information and that the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the warrant. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would be more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The applicant's evidence did not rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they fell below the levels of'reasonable apprehension of bias' which could be said to be appropriate under s. 11 of the Charter. 2) The search warrant was invalid because the accountant had filed an employment slip which purported to be of assistance in establishing the income tax for the purposes of the Excise Tax Act. There were no court proceedings under the Divorce Act or the Matrimonial Property Act. 3) The fact that the applicant had filed the employment slip did not raise a reasonable suspicion, conjecture, hypothesis or 'fishing expedition' as it fell short of the minimally acceptable standard from both common law and constitutional perspective. The application lacked credibility or fact of fact.  4) The only reasonable grounds to have a warrant in this case were the absence of the defective paragraphs."
d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded 80 milligrams in 100 milliliters of blood. The accused denied having care or control of the vehicle, and argued that he was too intoxicated to drive. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of either offence.  1) The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude a trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2) The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. The defendant's car was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running. In order for it to go anywhere but into the wall of the adjacent building, the parking brakes would have to be started, the Parking brake released and the transmission put into reverse gear. There was little, if any, danger of the motor vehicle being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted on the condition that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The children were to be returned to the father directly but the father proposed that he would continue living with the mother and take anger management courses while he first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the father had been on methadone for most of his life and that the children appeared to be doing well apart from the screens. Although the mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly, the father was seeking to have the children returned to him in his care as a result of domestic violence issues. The father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 youth offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were mostly property crimes and failures to comply with recognizances and probation orders. Both the father and the children were apprehended by the Ministry when they were born. The mother had resided with the father for the past six months and he had been in the Ministry for the last six months. Both children were in the care of the Ministry and H.H. and the father were apprehended at birth. H H. H. was the mother who was in the custody of the father. The parents had discussed and agreed to attend parenting classes, participate in and complete parenting class, remain drug free and provide all drug screen results; the father agreed to work with KidsFirst and attend and complete treatment. H:H., the mother supported the father who proposed that the three children should continue to live with him while the mother went to treatment and first began addressing her own addiction problem. The issues before the Ministry was the permanency agreement between the parents, the permanencies agreement, the parenting program and the parents and the non-compliance with the parenting services and the fact that the parents would have joint custody of their children should the Ministry apply for a permanent wardhip in the face of the mother's addiction problems; the length of the parental services agreement and the number of visits by the father to the mother; the issues with the two parents; the evidence regarding the father's involvement with the Harm Reduction Methadone Program; the nature of the relationships between the parties and the impact on the children if the father leaves the program; the impact upon the parents if the children continue"
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs sought to compel the defendant to provide notice to them of the nine property owners who had, to date, received the package. The defendant motion was dismissed. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce a plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre-certification notice. The plaintiff cannot be a class member until class is certified which would in turn suggest that the section was not intended to operate until class existed. It is important to keep in mind that this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action' and the Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. The purpose of the motion was to give the defendant an opportunity to acquaint itself with prospective plaintiffs through a 'lawful manner'. The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of that discretion."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. Both parties had some health problems. The respondent was diagnosed with breast cancer, had had surgery followed up by radiation, and had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. After the separation, the respondent had continued to live with the appellant, although she took a buyout of her pension and job in 2006 in exchange for $35,000. Although she was no longer working, she had taken some courses which she believed she was capable of working 30 hours a week at minimum wage and she did not indicate why she was not able to work full time. The court found that it was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish that she was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence before Sandomirsky J. was established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. (see: 2008 SKQB 222) the respondent did not engage in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousals maintenance order had expired and only a few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spouse support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that her was “disabled and still receiving treatments”, she was enrolled in a legal assistant program, and that she had sought permanent full time employment but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate she was incapable of work, did not, in fact, say that she could not work, and indicated that her children were still living with her. She was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. The appeal was allowed."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010.

HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 and double party access under Column 4. 1)The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. The issues that were litigated were substantial and merited a trial. 2)The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial was found in Rule 184B of the Queen’s Bench Rule of Court and the Rule of 184(dismissal) which calls for double costs from the date of service."

HELD: Rather than filing an appeal, the respondent should have pursued a remedy in Queen's Bench. The proper procedure would have been to apply under Queen's Bench Rule 271 to have the matter opened up and disposed of on the basis of the evidence. The matter was adjourned sine die with leave to bring the matter back to Court if the appellant is unsuccessful at Queen's Bench.","The applicant obtained an order for possession pursuant to s. 3(3) of The Recovery of Possession of Land Act, 1978 granting possession of land and premises described as 1615 Broadway Avenue. The proposed appellant did not appear on that application and the order was made in her absence. The applicant filed a Notice of Appeal alleging certain facts with respect to why the order ought not to have been made.

d_2012skca52.txt,"The accused was convicted of four counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 8 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20-year Sexual Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) compliance order. At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Court of Appeal interpreted s. 490.013(2.1) as meaning that offenders who commit multiple designated offences would be subject to a lifetime SOIRA compliance order. If Parliament had intended a narrow application of s. 490.013(2.1), it would have used the same language as it did in s. 490.012(3). Parliament clearly intended s. 490.013(2.1) to apply more broadly to any offender who committed multiple designated offences regardless of whether the sentences for those offences are imposed separately or altogether.","The Crown appealed the sentencing judge's order under s.490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) for 20 years. The accused was convicted on each of four charges of sexual assault. As the Crown proceeded by indictment, he was subject to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years on each conviction. He was sentenced to four concurrent terms of 4 years and 8 months imprisonment (after 4 months credit for time served on remand) and he received a 10 year firearm prohibition order, a DNA order and a 20 year SOIRA compliance order. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentencing judge erred in law in his interpretation of s. 490.013(2.1). The meaning of the section is plain: offenders who commit multiple designated offences will be subject to a lifetime SOIIRA compliance Order. Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence. The Court of Appeal disagrees."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused, who was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in cocaine (exceeding s. 5(1)) contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, was sentenced to a term of 7.5 years in custody and prohibited from applying for parole before the expiry of three years. He appealed his conviction. Crown counsel disclosed the existence of the Proceeds of Crime Unit investigation and Index when they were preparing defence counsel for cross-examination. In the weeks immediately following the trial, the Crown disclosed 27 documents provided by the Crown, some of which were references to the accused's activities. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a period of time to allow the disclosure to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances. Defence counsel filed a letter of objection stating that, having not seen the documents, she should not be called upon to establish relevance. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The trial judge's refusal to adjourn the trial and the subsequent issuance of written materials by defence counsel constituted a miscarriage of justice. The Court reviewed the case and found that the Crown failed to establish that the documents were relevant and that the Court was in the same position as the trial judge, which means that it is not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial is the only remedy available."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their 3 year old son; and awarded child support to the appellant of $2,726 per month. The appellant appealed only portions of the interim order dealing with the enforcement of spousals support arrears created as a result of an interim order. He argued the amount in issue was the amount he should be credited to for his payments with respect to the matrimonial home and that he may be prejudiced by the order because the petitioner's means are limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able to repay any 'overpayment' of support. HELD: The application to lift a stay of proceeding is allowed. A stay is imposed until the hearing of the appeal. 1)The appellant has made all of the payments required by the January 20, 2016 interim order and is entitled to make the payments subject to the order. The Court of Appeal Rules provide that service and notice of appeal does not stay the execution of an order for spousally support. The purpose of lifting a stay is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiciced simply by appealing. 2)The Court of appeal has a stated objective to prevent injustice and to ensure the results are as fair and equitable as possible. In making decisions, the Courts have a stated goal in making decisions. In this case, the court was satisfied that a stay should be imposed to enable the appellant to continue with his application for enforcement of the spousAL support arreears created by the interim orders."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, and two other charges related to the Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE). The accused was a member of the RCMP. He had been on the Internet for 10 years and had been involved in a number of Internet child exploitation investigations. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court could not conclude that the accused had in his possession child pornography but Constable Lair testified that the ICE unit had the ability to browse through the contents of a shared folder and could obtain copies of all of the files being shared. In addition to the ICE team, Constable Lair also testified that he was familiar with the TORP file sharing program. He testified that there were three computers in the residence which had the operating system encrypted so that it could not be accessed without a password. One of the computers had three hard drives, one of which was non-password protected. Examination of the hard drive revealed that it was used by the accused to direct traffic from the Internet to whatever devices he had on that computer. HELD: The Court held that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the two people who had downloaded the file would have the same G.U.I.D. number. However, the Court found that the same person could have access to the same file if it was shared with others. Therefore, the court ordered the search of the entire duplex and ordered the ICE to enter a password for that particular computer. The search was authorized and the accused was detained."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc. in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and related equipment. Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it ceased to pay invoices as they became due. Eventually the plaintiff demanded payment of its outstanding invosices and the defendant denied it. HELD: A fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. 1) In businesses such as the plaintiff's, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged. The plaintiff has not quantified its costs, but the defendant asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair price. 2) The plaintiff was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due.  3) With respect to costs, it was clear that prior to November of 2015 the defendant did not take issue with the invoicing. Some of these invoiced were negotiated, reduced, and paid. Others were simply left unpaid without explanation. The Court was unable to determine how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. Since the parties could not monitor their time on each occasion that it performed services, the plaintiff had to ensure that the time it charged was accurate and if it did not, then it had breached its contract with the plaintiff."

Each party had a different understanding of the duties of the Fund Development Officer which misunderstanding the Judge classified as a mutual mistake. The failure of performance by plaintiff entitled defendant to repudiate the contract. Defendant's counterclaim for rescission of first agreement, and repayment of monies paid under second agreement, failed where it accepted plaintiff's performance and paid consideration therefore.","This was an action brought by Fossil Fuel Development Ltd. against Tudex Petroleums Ltd. (Tudex) for breach of contract claiming damages. Fossil had incorporated its own company and incorporated it for the purpose of becoming involved with the defendant. When there was a failure of a performance by the defendant in an essential part of the contract, the defendant was entitled to repudiate it. The defendant argued that the parol evidence rule had been disallowed and that, having accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was no basis for rescission of the agreement. HELD: Fossil's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff had accepted the defendant's evidence that he was obligated under the agreement to bring in investment capital and that the defendant thought his part in the venture was confined to the area of introducing potential investors. When a failure is a component of a contract that is legitimized, an order for rescissions is not necessary. 2)There was no ambiguity. The plaintiff was hired as a fund development officer. The only person who was not required to testify was the plaintiff. 3)The defendant was awarded a monthly retainer of $6,250 for each month commencing June 2/81. The claim for $31,500 was rejected on the same ground that rescission was disallowed."
e_1991canlii2551.txt,"The issue in this appeal was whether a landlord can give notice of a rental increase at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease. Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year. However, in 1990 the rent was raised from $500 to $515 per month. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The decision of the Residential Tenancies Board set aside the decision and the order of the trial judge. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order and order set aside, that s. 11 of the Act is amended and the Rent Review Act is not the only statutory protection for the tenants. The Act is intended to protect the tenant from being coerced by the landlord into giving up his contractual rights. The tenants had entered a year to year lease in the standard form with respect to their residential premises. The rent was increased three months prior to the expiration of the lease. That is, the landlord could not unilaterally increase the rent during the yearly tenancy. The increase may be only once every twelve months."

It provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The agreement also provided that they would cohabit for more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose. The parties did not vitiate their agreement to live separate and apart. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the separation agreement was signed in 1996 and the parties had not lived separately. The respondent was evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions. He questioned the nature of the agreement in light of the narrow issue presented to him. He also questioned the circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason for the gave forit;  his repeated statements that he swore they would never cohabitate and his action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer;  he was in receipt of $10,000 from the Ontario Court of Appeal for default judgment on a charge of fraud. He was clearly frustrated by the amount of money he was forced to pay and he was frustrated by his inability to re-establish the marriage he had established in 1996. His stated intention was to have the marriage re-established and to allow his former spouse to have joint custody of their children. Although the costs of the trial were in the narrowest issue, the fact that the respondent had refused to pay any of the costs himself indicated that his costs would be appropriately directed to the petitioner."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The appellant filed a complaint under Part II of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code alleging that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. CUPE brought a claim against the appellant for breach of contract and breach of employment agreement. The appellant argued that the tribunal erred in law in finding that the city was responsible for the discrimination, as the appellant had not been properly accommodated for the considerable time that elapsed since the complaint took place. Dismissing the application, that the appellant has reasonable grounds to believe the City of Regina has not been discriminatory in the manner in which it has been compensated. The tribunal also failed to take into account the appellant's disability. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The appellant had a record of 16 years as a casual employee with the City. He did not have the physical capacity to work as a truck driver. He could only drive a truck. The fact that he had Cerebral Palsy made his complaint within the Code's limitation period a major turning point in his career. The decision to award the appellant $8,902 as a result of the tribunal's decision was erroneous. 2)The tribunal failed to consider the human rights impact of the seniority system on the appellant. It was impossible for the appellant to gain employment with the city given that he was no longer able to work. The discrimination against him was severe. He suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered from memory loss and memory loss. He lost his driving licence in 1998, left his employment because of this discrimination and had a disability pension. 3)The trial judge was unable to find any discriminatory features of the City's employment system which could reasonably be attributed to the appellant’s disability. There was no basis or foundation upon which the tribunal could have been held to have held the appellant solely on the issue of the disability. The City had a duty to accommodate the appellant based on the principles set out in the collective bargaining agreement between the appellant and the unions."

The main ground of the application is that the service of the statement of claim on the defendant did not comply with Rule 19(1) of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent did not receive the notice of the default. The respondent is not registered mail. 2)It was the belief and understanding that the receipt by way of registered mail of the Statement of Claim did not constitute proper service on myself. As such did not take any steps to defend the action believing that proper personal service would be made on me. 3)Rule 18 is new rule and came into effect in December 2002. have been unable to find any authorities that have considered its provisions. Prior to its implementation the procedure to be followed to set set aside noting for a default and resulting default was as set out by Schachtel v. Wasmann, 2004 SKQB 120. The circumstances under which the judgment was set aside were settled. The application should be made as soon as possible after the judgment comes to the knowledge of the defendant, but mere delay will not bar the application unless an irreparable injury will be done to the plaintiff or the delay has been wilful. The affidavit must show the nature of the defence and set forth facts which will enable the court or judge to decide whether or not there was a matter which would afford defence to the action. Any delay in making the application must be explained."

The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The husband sought a termination of spousal support or a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. The wife suffered from serious mental illness since the marriage ended. He received a severance package and pension from the military in 1998. He had been supporting his wife for nine years.

He sought to have the support end in 2008. Permitting the application and considering the wife's application, that (1) there has been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act, and (2) the applicant's income is now primarily derived from his pension. The Court could not conclude that his obligation to her should extend beyond the length of their marriage.

His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay.

With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983 and he shall pay the petitioner for the support of Reidar and Bronwyn, born December 1998 and the sum of $568 per month commencing October 1, 2005 and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowanceOn personal property of the partnership the respondent is to be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those arrenars to be paid monthly. There is no reason why the overpayment by a payor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances. 3) The Court will deal with each issue on a year-by-year basis. The individual amounts will differ by year. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost allowances and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable. There was nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is one of those files where it appeared that the holding of trial, in fact, was a more efficient and cheaper method of coming to conclusion regarding the issue of maintenance than ongoing negotiation or pre-trial. Each party achieved partial success in their approach."
e_2007nssc260.txt,"The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant for failing to supply three of the four quarterly amounts of coal due pursuant to their contract. Following a two-day summary judgment application, the court granted judgment for one of the three quarters, with damages to be determined. Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery.","The applicant power company applied for summary judgment against the defendant, alleging that the applicant failed to supply coal under a Coal Supply Agreement. The Agreement contained four call options for the purchase and delivery of low Sulphur Coal in quarterly installments of up to 100,000 tonnes. The applicant sought summary judgment for the alleged failure to supply the requisite tonnage in quarters 2, 3 and 4 of 2004. The court granted summary judgment in the matter of quarters 2 and 4. The decision left it to the plaintiff to try to reach an agreement on costs. The plaintiff was unsuccessful in this application. In addition to costs of the application, the court was asked to rule on costs of another application brought by the applicant to compel production. The parties ultimately reached a compromise, avoiding the need for the hearing of this second application but only after discovery of the affiant who had provided an affidavit. The affiant was an expert retained by AMCI to provide an opinion with respect to the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by NSPI. The expert advised counsel for the applicant that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to the insufficiency of materials provided by the company. The discovery hearing took place in New York City in order to reduce the inconvenience and costs of conducting it in Colorado, United States of America, where the witness resides. This was done at the suggestion of the applicant's counsel. Damages had yet to be determined. The Court awarded costs for a one-half day application based on Tariff C of $1000."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","This was an appeal from a Queen's Bench decision allowing this appeal and setting aside the order of the Chambers judge on the basis that he acted without any evidence that certain activities of the children were extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Federal Child Support Guidelines and that he failed to consider and apply the definition of'special and extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) The chambers judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the extracurricular expenses are extraordinary. 2) The expenses are ordinary. They are covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per year which the respondent receives tax free. 3) It is implicit in his conclusion that the appellant found that approximately one-half (i.e., six) of these extracursurricular activities were found to be extraordinary. He also addressed the question of the respondent's income, which was $53,744.68. 4) The respondent argued that the chambers judge ought to be considered to have taken into account the total costs of all the activities and to have concluded that roughly half of this was 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, and therefore ordered that the respondent pay proportion of half the children's activities. The appellant's position that these expenses cannot reasonably be considered extraordinary within the Meaning of s.7(1)(f) and that they are not extraordinary in the scheme of the guidelines was supported by the evidence before the court. There was no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chamber judge."
e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a deposit they gave to the defendant. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and alleged that the defendant was negligent in failing to obtain the required materials. When the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff $2,200.00, the plaintiff and plaintiff both filed a dispute note and became a plaintiff in the counterclaim for the sum of $3,604.13. In that action, the defendant argued that the plaintiff's misappropriation of funds from the plaintiff for a substantial amount of back-payments and other miscellaneous expenses that were payable by the defendant company directly or indirectly to the plaintiff. In his counterclaim, the Defendant also submitted that the amount owed by the plaintiff was 65% of the total loss due to the frustration of the contract and that it should be borne in a 35/35 ratio. Both parties acted in good faith. In this case, the contract was frustrated and the plaintiff should bear the majority of the loss and the defendant, in the 35% range, 35% to 45% loss. The court found that the sufficiency of the argument in this case was sufficient to justify a counterclaim in the Court of Appeal."
e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a)) of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the officer was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer. There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused. Based on the totality of the above evidence, the Court held that the demand for breath samples amounted to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. Therefore, it was reasonable for the officer to conclude that the accused was impaired, and the breath samples unlawfully seized. The evidence thus obtained should be excluded from the Certificate of Analysis."

There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings. HELD: The Court ordered that the two actions be tried one immediately after the other in the manner determined by the trial judge and that the defendant be given leave to amend his Statement of Defence.","FIAT: The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules for an order that this action and Tsatsi v.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the children's benefit. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children’s provisional permission to attend was not extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of The Education Act and found that the CÉF had not complied with its commitments to the children. HELD: The Court held that the plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed as an abuse of process.  1)The Court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-right holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its exercise of its discretion.  2)Not all Canadians have the right to have their children educated in French. This is not a school dedicated to the learning of the French language, its mission is to ensure the increasing use of French as a first language in the community. Special emphasis is placed on culture, identity development and the sense of community. It is impossible for a non-rights holder to have a dog in the school. The lawless children were subjected to discrimination, harassment and discrimination due to their disability. The school administration was unable to accommodate the dog because he had special needs. The family was denied access to the school premises due to his autism. The court awarded them special damages for out-of-pocket expenses, travel expenses, the cost of training and re-training the dog notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 22.3(2) of the Animal Protection Act and general damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation."

The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.

The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws, and the defendants. In issue was whether the defendants had misled consumers. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)Loblaws is governed by the regulations under the Food and Drugs Act, RSC 1985, F-27 and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act. The Court reviewed consumer protection law and found there was no genuine issue for trial. 2)The plaintiff had not specifically directed her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand. The facts are undisputed. The only reason to label and market identical products differently is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 3)The Court was comfortable with following this judicial authority and determining the defendants' summary judgment application prior to having to decide the plaintiffs' application for certification. There was no application before the Court with respect to the claims as a class as whole."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.","The applicant applies pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office have rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The application proceeded on March 12, 2015. For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed. It is not in the interests of justice to extend the time beyond the 30 day time period provided by the Act. There are a number of affidavits from former Chiefs and Council members confirming the quality and effectiveness of the legal services the applicant has provided to the client. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The applicant's request is unreasonable and it is not fair. The applicant was not seeking to assess the relative value of legal services during the time period for which the assessment was sought. It cannot be presumed that the client could effectively gather together the information on all of the matters he provided legal services in relation to so as to explain each item in an assessment as requested by Cowessess. The information put forward here is not from her own direct observations and conflicts with the evidence provided from sources who had the opportunity to directly observe. 2) While there are concerns about the amount of fees charged, the threshold set by Klebuc J. and still in essence applicable given the content of the allegation is lacking. This is as a result of the request itself and it was not fair to the respondent as an individual and as a lawyer.  3) There are numerous documents that can be considered as reference material, some of which are dated back to at least 2010. The documents must be clearly identified. 4) The affidavit evidence must establish the appropriateness of doing so. In addition, the affidavit repetition of what the applicant purportedly told her was not proper evidence. 5) The respondent was not required to provide affidavit evidence justifying the extension of the time for the assessment."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner was awarded interim child and spousals support and an equal division of family property. The respondent was granted access to the child for the first three weekends of each month and, in July 2014, he obtained an order granting him interim access and prohibiting the respondent from removing D.K. from the jurisdiction. The Court reviewed the respondent’ s.2 Federal Child Tax Return, SOR/97-175 [Guidelines] income and found it had increased to $285,000.00 in 2014 and was forecast to reach $280,000 by the time the trial went to court. The court found it would be difficult for the petitioner to obtain employment in Canada given the circumstances. The child had not taken a single vacation in the preceding two years and, as he was self-employed, he had concerns about his health and safety and claimed that if he was unable to work, he would be forced to return to his native country."
