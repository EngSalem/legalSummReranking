The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association. The appellant alleged that the panel acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging him with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were clearly not his responsibility. The charges involved disclosure of information about federal cabinet minister; permitting employees to take part in'side deals' (trades in securities not approved by his head office); failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; and failing to supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Allowing the appeal, that the Board's findings of fact did not create any new rights, for which there was ample evidence, necessary to support its finding that the Charter had no application in the present case."

Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the grandchildren of the deceased, pursuant to s. 2(a) of the Fatal Injuries Act and s. 163 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia. The deceased had been killed in a motor vehicle accident. The action was commenced on her behalf by the surviving grandchildren. At issue was whether the grandchildren should be excluded from hearing the evidence of each other. The Executor and Trustee, Ronald J. Downie, wished to exclude each granddaughter from their discovery examination. No application had been made to exclude the plaintiff's counsel."
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The judge granted the adjournment on the ground that he had not been able to obtain the attendance of the victim from New Brunswick, who was living in New Brunswick. The applicant applied to have the adjournments granted on the basis that the Crown had not cooperated with the trial setting dates and had fumbled on one of the subpoenas. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority."

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The accused pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, one count of possession of stolen auto and one count dangerous driving prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation.

The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody and the amount paid by Saskatchewan Government Insurance for damage to vehicles was $21,062.71. 2)J.M.'s principal partner in these auto thefts was [T.D.] who received 8 months open Custody for some 19 auto thefts and attempts. 3)The Court was also aware that T.D.'s application for an application pursuant to s. 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act and an order for probation to one and 8 months closed custody to the other cannot be reconciled."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.

The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. 1)The respondent's income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings. The appellant seeks to have his income increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of myCapital cost allowance. 2)There is clearly no basis for adding the Value of the Grain on hand to the income of the respondent.

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence.

The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not going to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission hearing would be completely unopposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. 3)There is nothing unconscionsable about allowing a Commission hearing to continue even if it should become known to the Crown, because the Commission is not relying on conviction, it will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s.112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations.

1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while unlawfully possessing marijuana and contrary to s. 4(1) the Narcotic Control Act, unlawfully cultivating and possessing cannabis. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused and the vehicle stopped on a grid road leading to a Saskatchewan tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, the officer noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to bulge and he asked the accused if he would empty his pockets. The accused said he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the officer indicated that he was going to try and open the black box. The voir net was conducted and the accused was arrested. The Crown did not offer any explanation for the question as to why it was asked that question. HELD: The accused was not detained, nor any search of the vehicle commenced. Even if the question 'where are you going' was innocuous social conversation, that search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. of the Charter.  1) The Court held that a stopping vehicle as part of a random check stop constitutes detention of the operator of a vehicle. Once an individual has been placed in jeopardy by the criminal justice system, he should have the right to choose whether to remain silent or remain silent. The Court questioned the validity of the stop and the detention, whether it was an arbitrary detention contrary to the Charter, whether the search was unreasonable, whether there were exigent circumstances upon which the accused could have obtained a warrant, if there had been any reasonable or probable grounds to believe that an offence had been committed, and whether a search of a suspected drug dealer's premises was unreasonable. 2) Counsel argued the present case is on all fours with Mellenthin. The Supreme Court recognized that the random stop of a motorist amounts to an arbitrary detentions and the Court recognized there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Act does not require that an individual be detained in a vehicle as long as he is not performing any service-related police function and the Crown stipulated it did not argue that the accused had consented to the search. Once the accused is detained, however, he must provide an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel without delay. There was no"
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against the convictions and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme of Canada on the advice of Halykh and then on the further advice of Dean MacKinnon. In 1999 this Court allowed this Crown appeal, raising the sentence to ten more years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before them. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, it was not convinced the grounds relied upon had sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of s. 679(3) of the section. The court was unable to decide on any of the grounds referred to in s. 7335. It would be appropriate to decide the application on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought under Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. The first motion was brought by the former police officer who alleged that the Crown had not commenced criminal proceedings within the meaning of s. 579 of the Limitation of Actions Act. He sought an order pursuant to s. 2(1)(a) of the Public Officers' Protection Act that the portions of his claim stand dismissed. This was based on Rule 188 of the Code. The second motion sought to extend the limitation period nunc pro tunc to a further year. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. 1)The Court of Appeal had held in Boudreault v. Barrett that a statutory limitation period is an insurmountable obstacle in the way of making a nunc de t tunc order. 2)Limitation of actions are substantive in character as opposed to procedural. They provide defences which should not be defeated by retroactive orders. 3)The limitation period did not commence until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. There was no admissible evidence to establish that the action was doomed to fail. 4)The claim against the Crown for malicious prosecution, negligence, breach of Charter rights and conspiracy was dismissed. 5)The Act does not apply to an action against a registrar of land titles under the Land Titles Act. Sections 173(b) and (c) of The Public Officers Protection Act may be cited. 6)The issue of when the time starts to run in tort against a public officer is a factual one. However, absent an agreed statement of facts, there should be an order made pursuant to Rule 188 for an extended limitation period as there was no evidence that this had occurred prior to the trial."
2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue is the interim custody of the child. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that is what happened. In April 2000, the respondent was allowed to have every second weekend. Since that time, the child has resided with the petitioner and the respondent. The petitioner claims that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the respondent would see the child every second Sunday and every weekend thereafter. The respondent has had access. HELD: The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent and reasonable telephone access. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this. The child is doing well and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. The court found that the respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the petitioner."

HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992 and Regulations made thereunder. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies the husband had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the letter of August 6, 2002 was not the direction of the Superintendent, which may be enforced pursuant to s.16 of the Act and that its decision respecting his powers was open to him to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting the powers he claimed to have and purported to exercise was not strictly necessary to the decision. The matter was also addressed as a preliminary issue only without any adjudication on the merits. It is impossible to address the scope and breadth of statutory provision in the absence of a factual context. The issue is left open for the Superintendent to argue another day, either in the stayed proceeding or in another case, in proper factual context, which was lacking here."

For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The court retained the interest they acquired in their own pensions and the child care expenses would be appropriate in these circumstances. The parents agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children for the next five years. The child had been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents for the last five years and sought to have the father's access to take place every second weekend. The mother sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the father would equally share their time with the children. HELD: The current parenting arrangements were in place for five years with the exception of one week when the children resided with the mother. The current arrangements would not create a change for the children's schooling or their relationship with the adults in their life. However, they have been able to perform this difficult parenting task in their children's best interest.  1)The current arrangements are in place and the children have been enjoying the time with their mother. 2)The father requested that his weekly child care allowance be reduced to $647 per month for the duration of the trial.  3)The parties had been unable to establish that the current arrangement was detrimental to the children particularly given that they were living apart for 5 years and had not had the opportunity to transition to a shared parenting arrangement. 4)The mother was to contribute $100 per month to child support.  5)Spousal support was ordered to be paid in the amount of $647. The father was to pay $647 for child care in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost in their respective incomes.  6)The court acknowledged that the parents had a home base. They had, to a degree, a homebase. The parties had, in five years, been able, to provide a consistent and consistent parenting experience. They were able to accomplish this task in five of the last six years without the mother's assistance."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant who had been standing on the property with him. The defendant had not retreated from the property and the defendant had a shovel ready when the defendant struck him in the leg with his fist. The knife was not in the defendant's hand when the altercation took place. The confrontation was described as a 'fist fight' and the defence witnesses testified that the defendant told the accused to stay off his property and that the confrontation was over. The Court found that the accused was not prepared to heed the obvious meaning of a gesture, but rather was intent in prevailing over the defendant to remain off his land and assert what he unreasonably believed to be his right to enter a premises. The accused was convicted of aggravated assault, by wounding the complainant and that of assault of the complainant by using or threatening to use a weapon, contrary to S.267(a); and of possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. The defence evidence included testimony given by the accused's aunt. The court found that when the accused confronted the complainant with his allegations of theft, the accused indicated that the complainant would stab him and the accused made no motion to use the knife. Finally, the Court found it could not have been more reasonable for the accused that he should have taken steps to retreat from the altercation and engaged in the confrontation with the shovel and the knife, thereby placing himself in the role of aggressor."

The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The questions are answered as follows: 1) are the children of S.T. who is legally married to S.M. The Minister seeks an order under s. 11 of the Act declaring Katie, Hannah and Bobby to be children in need of protection. The children are the mother's three children and have significant physical and mental disabilities. The nature of those disabilities was described as having been acquired through S. T.’s contact with the mother and the mother. The child was exposed to domestic violence and there was a significant risk that the children would suffer physical or emotional harm if exposed to that violence. The father of one of the children testified that he did not want the children to suffer physical harm because he was not able and willing to provide for their needs. The evidence in this regard is the mother”s change in attitude towards the children since the apprehension. The Court reviewed the various specialists who had been involved with the children and concluded that the most important issue was continuity in the children’S care. The court found that the mother had changed and was no longer hostile to the child”. 2) The children were examined and the evidence was concluded that there was no evidence to support any of the expert” s”evidence””who”d” agreed that the evidence did not support a permanent custody order for the children. The parents” continued to have contact with each other and were able to work cooperatively with the Minister."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $51,608. The court found that the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the defendant and entitled to full payment of the contractual price. The plaintiff’s position was that the German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. The documents submitted by the defendant were not admitted into evidence. The issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to rely on the testimony of the lawyer who represented the miller at trial and thus entitled to the full amount owing under the contract. The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant. The quality requirements of the contract had been met and the farmer was not a party to that contractual obligation. There was no evidence that the testing by the company that was used to determine the correct moisture content led to the rejection by the millers. If the plaintiff had established that there was a potential issue with the supply chain, it was established that it would have met the standard. The Court awarded the plaintiff the sum of $61,608 to satisfy the contract and ordered pre-judgment interest on the sum owing to the plaintiff for the period 2006 until the judgment date."

2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. The by-laws prohibited the erection of any sign without a permit and stipulated that a sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. The application was allowed and an order was made pursuant to 266(3) of the Ontario Municipal Government act directing the respondents to remove the sign. The purpose of the by-law was to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prevent distraction to motor vehicles. The sign also exceeded an area permitted by the City's Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. The Town conceded that the by law limited its freedom of expression, but the Court of Appeal determined the bylaw constituted a reasonable limit on freedom ofexpression pursuant to ss. of the Charter. The limiting measures of the BY-law are rationally connected to the objective and effectively addresses unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The primary objectives of the By-laws are to reduce traffic, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concerns for pedestrians and motor vehicles and to maintain the character of the Town by minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent property and the street scape. The By-Law also promotes the use of signage in an urban fashion. In this case, the limiting measures were rationally related to the objectives and effectively addressed unrestricted use by the sign in a manner that maximized the effective Use of Signs."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. The mother's attendance at the trial was not totally supported by the evidence. Whether the mother would be required to produce her father's financial records is a matter for the Chamber to determine. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that since the parties' residence was in the countryside, it would not be appropriate for him to canvass for financial information of the mother in the absence of her, to find out what the father's expenses were and to hear from witnesses at viva voce hearing. The application for the calculation of the number of child maintenance was returned to the Chamber list for March 8, 2004. HOLD: Both applications were dismissed.  1)The Court would not require the mother to produce any of the financial information required of a jury in the child's future proceedings because spouses maintain a joint bank account into which the breadwinner deposits his or her earnings, does not justify imputing portion of that income to the homemaker spouse. 2)The mother would not need to obtain the full accounting of the cattle production in order to complete the trial. The court would be better advised to obtain financial records of the numbered corporation owned by the petitioner's husband, who owned, leased, or leased all of the farmlands and equipment involved in the enterprise. The petitioner would be charged 20 percent of the expenses and would receive 20% of the profits. Although counsel for the respondent has stated that the petitioner 'performs significant duties for the numbered Corporation but draws no income from it', Janice Petersen testified that she devoted but 1 hour per month performing such duties. When one considers that the corporation owns but one truck, operated by Mr. Petersen, from which all of income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that income from the corporation should be imputed to Janice is nothing less then ludicrous. The fact that the respondent's income is deposited into joint account with the petitioner is no different than occurs in many households. Because spouses maintain joint bank accounts"
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the failure to remit the rent, failed to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Certificate of Appeal was not issued to the appellant but was sent to his lawyer. The lawyer was to pay the hearing costs of the hearing and the fine himself. The letter of reprimand was to go in the appellant's file. The court also found that there was no precedent existed in Nova Scotia to provide guidance to the Commission on how it should carry out its task. The Commission's decision was based on four contextual factors: 1) the Commission had the expertise to determine what is in the best interests of the public when dealing with its members; 2) there is no privative clause and that there is a statutory right of appeal; 3) the commission is a quasi-judicial body with power to make rules and enforce them; and 4) there are no precedents for providing guidance to a Commission on the subject of misconduct. In this case, the failure of the applicant to state its reasons was not evidence of bias or unfairness but rather of lack of insight and insight into the circumstances of the individual and his/her circumstances. The applicant's credibility was central to all five allegations and was at the forefront of all of the issues presented.

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, after the application of Morrison, the company was liquidated. Thereafter, the main defendant in the action is Dwayne Walbaum. He diverted virtually all of its assets to himself, his companies and his wife Tammy Walbaum who was his sole shareholder. 2) Although counsel for the plaintiffs asserts that the evidence against all of the defendants will be relatively small in number, the facts supporting the claim against them are different from the legal issues surrounding the plaintiffs’ claim against the individual claims.  3) Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  4) The applications are brought pursuant to rule 41(c) which states: 41(1) where the joinder of multiple claims or parties in the same action may unduly complicate or delay the trial, or cause undue prejudice to party, the court may order separate trials, require one or more of the claimants to be asserted in one action, require that one of them be compensated for being required to participate in any part of trial in which he has no interest, and designate no more than two days in which the plaintiffs will adduce evidence. 5) It will be left to the pre-trial management judge to designate specific days on which defence evidence may be adduced during the trial and to make such an order as may seem just.  6) The applicants will not be forced to attend any portions of trial as they would otherwise require them to do so. 7) There is no evidence to support the allegations against the plaintiffs that they were involved in the divestiture of assets by the Walbarge Group.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parental arrangement. The petitioner now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations of the petitioner and incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. The principal basis for the petitioner's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a sharing parenting arrangement because he has not met the obligation to pay $2,000 per month as required by clause 9 in the separation document; and (3) a reduction in the respondent's income, which would leave him with no income to pay under the terms of this agreement. The corollaries relief judgment is set out in the Divorce Act and is subject to change whenever there is a significant change in circumstances."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The Court held that the issues were with respect to the interpretation of the priority agreements between the respondent and the other vendors and to the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse to restock direct ship inventory and whether the respondent was obliged to pay certain amounts pursuant to s. 50(2) and (3) of the Trade in Goods Act and whether CNH was obligated to purchase certain parts from the respondent for use in a specific purpose. The parties were on common ground that the word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' in order to distinguish between inventory and credits financed by the respondent. The respondent was entitled to claim prior security to unused parts of the respondent's inventory on the understanding that the part was not returnable by the dealer. The issue did not end there as the respondent contends that the priority extended to the respondent by paragraph 4.2 includes only assets that are not 'NHCC Financed Collateral'. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the respondent to refuse restock the direct ship parts. In the context in which the issue has arisen, this is a collateral matter which has no effect except as to costs."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and he applied for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. This decision follows a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that his hand was trembling as he handed over his documents, that his face was trembling, his eyes were puffy and he did not display any symptoms of nervousness. 2) The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The Court found that the accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the CDSA was infringed when he was detained in his vehicle for possession of stolen property. 3) There were a number of incidents during which the accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure. The accused raised the issue of intrusion of his personal property and privacy. His right to counsel was violated. The Court considered that his expectation of privacy in the presence of a stolen property or a stolen vehicle infringed. 4) During the course of the search, the police observed an older motor home weaving from the centre line over the fog line approximately six times. The motor home did not cross the line and was not speeding. The observed fresh black caulking around the panels and around the hood of the motor home caused the officers to observe slight movement in the area. The area around the window was clear of cigarette smoke but no alcohol. 5) The Court concluded that the observed weaving was consistent with a stolen motor vehicle. 6) The vehicle was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. Although the police cars being driven by both the accused and the driver were equipped with windshield view video cameras and audio recording devices, neither of them activated that equipment. 7) The only information that could be drawn from the vehicle's computer files was from the BC License Bureau. The Certificate containing the VIN number for the motorhome was located in a closet. The number of $20 bills with black duffel bags containing cocaine appeared on the third layer of the packaging. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags. Both of the accused testified that they were concerned that the driver might have been drinking and that they"
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. This robbery took place in a small room with only three persons present. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant's culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt based on the evidence as a credibility contest. The principles set out in R. v. W.(D), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 were recognized in this judgment and they were not lost on the court. While the court did not specifically refer to R.'s v.'W.(D.], [1991][1 SCCA 99] 1, it is satisfied that it recognized the importance and that he did not fell into the traps of simply comparison the Crown or defence positionswithout then going onto assess the entire of theevidence to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubts."
2_2011nssc338.txt,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.",The Small Claims Court adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small Claims court had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for a review of rental increase. He now heard an application for declaratory relief. The issue is whether or not the affidavit is properly before the Court. HELD: The Small claims court appeal provisions do not provide for the submission of any new evidence. The appeal is not hearing de novo. It is a re-hearing of the facts. It does not mean that parties are prevented from engaging in further legal representation but that it would be counterproductive in deciding the merits of the appeal. If the Small claims Court was to entertain an appeal of an interlocutory ruling it would result in delays in having matters heard and would likely result in increased costs to the litigants. The right to appeal final decision of Small Claims adjudicator on an issue involving residential tenancies is still open to be brought to this Court. Nothing in my decision will prejudice or preclude any of the parties to this particular action from launching an appeal if they feel aggrieved by the final decision that the adjudicator makes.
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.",The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 5(2) of the Code for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed the drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The Crown could not demonstrate constructive possession of the substance in the rock wall. The accused's evidence concerning what he could observe at the store was not consistent with the Crown's case. The encounters between the buyer and the accused were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not supported by any other possible explanations.
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, or in the alternative, of a litigation action, seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. They requested costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete indemnification of litigation, as concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The dispute in this case concerns to how to best distribute the funds distributed. The Bowsers suggest that $12,000 plus disbursements is the appropriate base amount; the Sheas suggest $7,500 plus $1,000. Both parties file Notice of Application in Chambers and request their signature. HELD: The application consumed one full day on October 18 and effectively the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m. This is effectively the hearing of that day. As the matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant amount of preparation and preparation to prepare for, conduct, conduct the hearing and to provide briefs to the court post hearing. The Court found that as appropriate partial compensation toward the Bowsers' expenses of the litigation and to do justice between the parties, it should apply a multiplier of two for a total of $6000 in costs.  1) The Court awarded $302.75 plus HST as the disbursement amount. 2) The court found that the costs should be distributed in the amount of $3,000 to the respondents in the event that the matter should be resolved in a fashion that would attract the maximum number of applications per chambers. This case was not one of those rare cases where solicitor client costs are awarded."

The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19 year old male appellant pled guilty to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm following an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. He appealed his sentence on the charge of dangerous drive causing bodily damage. The grounds of his appeal were that he had not consumed alcohol or drugs, and the three Criminal Code convictions related to dangerous driving caused bodily harm which resulted in the injuries of three people as a result of the motor vehicle accident. He had five previous motor vehicle accidents and three convictions under the Motor Vehicle Act for failure to obey traffic signs, speeding and failure to display license on demand. His driving record consisted of two convictions for possession of a narcotic, a theft under $1,000 and a theft in respect of which he was sentenced 45 days incarceration to be serve intermittently to be followed by six months probation. He also had three previous convictions for dangerous driving involving the use of a motor vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The court reviewed all of the authorities referred to and found that the offences were aggravating circumstances in the commission of a serious offence. The authorities were not sufficient to warrant the emphasis placed on general deterrence. The sentence imposed on the 19 yearold male appellant was unfit to continue his sentence."

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary the February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The applicant lost his employment and a debilitating leg injury. He sought to have the Court review his obligation and whether it should be terminated. HELD: 1)The agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide that spousals were either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial positions of the parties. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were. 2)The applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the spousaling order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have his obligation reviewed by the Court, it does not follow that his obligation should be termination. There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. It is significant that the agreement reached in 1995 does not provide for that spielal support was either timelimited or that is to be more varied if a substantial increase in future income will be found. 3)The parties had three children. The respondent had recently retired from her university education and was unable to find employment. She had recently purchased a house which could generate significant income but she resisted any reduction in her pension benefits due to the difficulty of accessing her RRSPs. She suggested that the applicant could also supplement his own income by selling his residence and purchasing some form of annuity."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for delegation to the Minister, for the duty of preparing and filing returns for tax purposes. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's finding that the returns were not filed, nor in the evidence to support his finding that they were. 2)The Act does nothing to set out an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code. 3)The letter of requirement was signed with the handwritten words of the Minister using the name 'Director-Taxation' over the typed or printed designation of 'Director' is sufficient to bring the document within the type described in sec. 244(13). The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. 4)There was no error on the part of the judge as to the appellant's contention that the return was not filed. The Court found that the Minister had not directly participated in or acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST return and that there was unreasonable delay which compromised the appellants right to a fair trial."

A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those particular materials. The court also found that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not subject to any'subjects for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v). The appellant will seek the order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court. The respondent shall pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. Herzberg was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08 and dangerous driving. He moved for a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show that disclosure had been made. The respondent then applied to the Queen’s Bench for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1) The appeal must be allowed. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of a judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. 2) Although it is the presiding judge”s responsibility to ensure a fair and public hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial. The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 3) In this case, the respondent said that she had not read the record. She was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she put out her mind."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. He was ordered to pay $600 per month as support for the child. The mother was underemployed and, since the father had not obtained full-time employment, she was also required to pay retroactive child support. HELD: 1) On all of the evidence it is the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to either pay full time or with a retroactive variation. 2) The father's decision to work only 3 months of the year and/or return to the school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. It is very likely that Mr. Pilat's financial position has not changed as result of the order for child support and he has not made a serious effort to locate employment. 3) The mother's request for discovery to determine the amount of income to be imputed to the father was not made lightly. It was clear that the substantial delays in this proceeding were primarily the result of his unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure.  4) The applicant's income for the purpose of this variation application was $40,000. Based on his gross annual income of $39,000, he should pay $328 per month in child support based on the $1,326 he received from Ipsco. Based upon the applicant's extracurricular activities and the fact that the former employer was no longer available, he did not provide his income to the court. 5) Costs were awarded to the applicant in the sum of $750 for the additional legal expenses associated with submitting motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information."
4_1993canlii6771.txt,"Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","The Court of Appeal dismissed the application for an order for costs. The Court found no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of the 2 year old son of the father to his father. The Father had not previously been regular access to the Child. HELD: The Appeal was dismissed. The award of maintenance was not unreasonable having regard for the length of the relationship (15 years), the husband'swage (approximately $55,000 per year) and the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home. The trial judge also chose to accept the testimony of an expert witness who testified as to relationships within the family. Further dislocation in the child's living arrangements and schooling would be detrimental to the child."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant sought to have a member of a previous firm barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of a similar ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following a change of solicitors. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to therespondent in any event of the cause. 1)The applicant had correctly referred to strategy counsel as being of the sort which could not be deduced from the pleadings and examinations for discovery by any competent lawyer. The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications, including this one, to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation.  2)Discretion should be taken with respect to claims of confidentiality, especially in the context of a ruling involving an attempt to dislodge a former solicitor from a certain litigation now existing under the 1982 change of government.  3)The situation in this case was exactly the same as decided in 1993 in a similar application respecting another former solicitors but this time the applicant was being consistent with a prior ruling involving another former solicitor."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. Hurd had an accident while water skiing, which he associated with the events of water skiing. He was hospitalized for four days. Four days later, while in class, he experienced discomfort in his chest. He required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment for $26,864.46 prayed for together with costs to be taxed. 1)The definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to extend to Hurd the benefits for which he sues in this action. 2)The medical evidence of the two qualified physicians who treated Hurd for pneumothorax and sent him on his way to Chicago to continue his studies was not clear. Neither of the quoted terms could be construed to relieve the insurer of the obligation to pay.  3)The evidence of Dr. Adams that travel was dangerous and put Hurd's life in jeopardy did not operate as an effective remedy. Neither the terms of insurance exempt MSI from payment because of a condition pre- existing the effective date of the policy nor of the exclusionary clause. 4)The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery because of the pneumothoria. The letter from the MSI's director to the plaintiff's mother in response to her request for confirmation of the time through which her son would have medical coverage while out of the province was written after Hurd experienced the pneumotomy and, perhaps more importantly, after Wrishko was informed about it. If, as Hurd now claims, he was excluded from coverage because of this experience, attach no significance to what he now says. 5)The primary reason for the non-payment was because Hurd could have returned to Saskatchewan to pursue his medical studies. The second reason was because travel would place Hurd in jeopardy and put him in jeopardy for surgery. The third reason was that Hurd did not wish to return home to Saskatchewan and thus could not afford to pay for the surgery. 6)Costs to be taxation."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. HELD: 1) The respondent has not provided the necessary evidence to establish undue hardship. The Court will impute income pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines on the basis he is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. While the applicant has other children to support and a heavy debt load, the parties' financial situations do not warrant the imputation of income. 2) The applicant has not shown that she is intentionally unemployed or that her approach to obtaining employment has been reasonable. The court must therefore advise the respondent within 30 days of this order whether he obtained employment and/or a contract position with the provincial government and, if so, his remuneration from that position."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","The accused was charged with two search warrants issued pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search was conducted in the area of the accused's residence and was subject to a number of infractions including breaching s. 6(2) of the CDSA, s. 465(1)(c) of that Code and possessing drugs in respect of which the warrant authorized. The accused was the only occupant of the premises. During the search of the residence, the Crown argued that only if both warrants were found to be invalid, the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. The Court found that both the Code and CDSA warrants were invalid that leaves only the facial validity of the CBSA warrant to consider. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2). The accused's rights were violated. HELD: The Court held that the application was supported by the endorsement of Cst. Olberg, the RCMP officer who had previously applied for and obtained two search warrant ss.487 and 487. The RCMP officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code & CDSA. Having prepared the warrants, the accused neglected to review them with the care and detail necessary and appropriate to such an important exercise. The evidence obtained as a result of the investigation was not excluded by the trial result.  1)The Court accepted the Crown's submission that the search warrants as issued were invalid. The affidavit submitted by the accused that the issuing Justice in Saskatchewan or the Endorsing Justice in British Columbia read the warrants presented with sufficient care or attention. 2)The affidavit submitted that the accused was not aware of the use of a third party's records when he executed the search warrant on him.  3)The evidence satisfied the Court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The only offence was the possession of marijuana. Marijuana was found in the shower of the main floor bathroom and in the yard area of premises. Other recreational vehicles were found in a yard area. 4)Criminal Code s. 8.5(1) is engaged. Section 583 reiterates the requirements of valid counts or charges in an indictment as specified by s. 581. 5) The omitted references to the illegal substance in the charges on page 1 are cured by reference to"
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to s17 of the Divorce Act. The relevant portions of that Act are set out in L.S. v. E.P. A. (2005), which set out the criteria for making retroactive child support orders. 2) There is no presumption in favour of retroactive support. Parliament has left this for judicial determination. 3) There are a number of factors that may militate against retroactivity. The British Columbia Court of Appeal (and other Canadian courts) disagreed with many of these factors. There is a presumption in favor of retroactivity on an interim application. 4) The Alberta court of appeal (and in some other cases) was dealing with provincial legislation. The BC court of justice (and it is not surprising given its 'presumptive approach') was not involved in this decision."

The learned judge did not make an error in law.","The appellant appeals the judgment of the Provincial Court made pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. HELD: The judgment is contrary to the law, the evidence and the weight of evidence. The learned trial judge erred in allowing the plaintiffs claim against a body corporate duly registered in the Province of Saskatchewan when it had agreed to honour its warranty by repairing the transmission provided the plaintiff bring the same to the defendant to have it repaired. The respondent shall not take any steps to enforce the judgment within 30 days to enable the appellant to comply with the order. An appeal is not a trial de novo but an appeal on the record and the findings of fact by the trial judge must be given a high degree of appellate deference. Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2001] and [2005] SCC 66 (Q.B.) are examples of cases where trial de nvo but a trial is not but an attempt at law based on the standard of correctness and the fact that the learned judge did not make an error of law based solely on the Standard of correctness. HOUSEN: The appellant appeals on the basis that the provincial court erred by allowing the Plaintiffs claim against DAN LEONARD AUTO SALES LTD. (RESPONDENT) when it agreed to pay $150 in lieu of taxation based on Schedule D of the tariff of costs, The Queen's Bench Rules, and other grounds as may come to attention upon receipt of the transcript of the evidence given at the trial. In this case, the issues were: 1) the judgment was contrary to s 39 of the Small Claims act, including the provision of a term and condition for sale of the said vehicle, which had an odometer reading in excess of 300,000 kilometers; 2) the respondent was required to take steps within 30 day to enable it to complywith the order; and 3) there were other grounds that could come to the attention of the appellant that could be pursued in future litigation on a case by case basis but none of which were dealt with in this case by trial.

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, aged 18 and 18. The wife was employed in the Navy and may be leaving the navy in the fall. The children were in the wife's care every second weekend. The husband was deployed in Afghanistan for six months. The parties had little face to face with each other. HELD: The court found that the parties' parenting was often initiated by the wife and did not occur with the consent of the wife. The evidence showed that the wife did not cooperate with the husband's requests to spend time with the children. The court awarded joint custody to the husband with the option of transferring the parenting to the wife when the husband was out of the military. The Court found that both parties were unable to parent co-operatively. Children do benefit from joint parenting because they will have the benefit of the expedience, knowledge and analysis provided by each parent. However, the nature and cause of conflict between the parties is a real and serious issue. The nature and causes of conflict are complex and can result in misunderstanding, confusion and conflict."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The police officer who provided the Operational Checksheets and any reference to Exhibit P-2 in the re-direct examination of the accused was to be excluded from evidence at this trial.  1) The officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the condition at the detachment. The information operating or in care or control of a vehicle over.08 was dismissed by the defence application for nonsuit. 2) The information being in the care or possession of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol was not included in the original documents. The police provided no notation in their notes, in his general Occurrence report or in their files about what had been disclosed to the defence. The Crown did not inform the accused of the reference to slurred speech until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document, Cst. Pshyk. Had he known the full content of the original document, under the heading Observations on Subject, I am satisfied that the officer would not have challenged Cst.(Pshyk) on his failure to made mention that the accused's speech was slurred. That is because, had he known of the full contents of the Original Check Sheet, he would have known that such a question would have inevitably drawn the Re-examination examination which occurred in this case.  3) The police did not provide full disclosure to the accused. The disclosure concern related to the undisclosed bottom portion of the Checksheet stands in a different light. Had the accused known of that reference, he wouldn't have challenged it. 4) The statements made by the Crown lawyer and the defence lawyer were not made to the court. The statements by the police officer were not asked to testify at the trial. The full disclosure issue was never raised at the Crown inquiry.

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007, entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damages against unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. The equipment was ordered to be installed by employees of the defendant in October 2007 and it was in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff at all material times. There was no material representation and no fraud. The plaintiff signed the agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with the equipment and had had two and one half years with the vendor to inspect it and to commence the agreement on the date to be established by Irwin. There were no service contracts between the parties and the plaintiff was not aware of the equipment being used. There had been no service contract entered into between the two parties. The technician who installed the equipment was now deceased and could not offer his opinion on what occurred prior to October 2007. The Plaintiff now claims that he signed that agreement under duress and that to his knowledge, the computer was not working prior to that date. The Court concluded that there was no evidence that the plaintiff signed a letter of agreement that said that they had 'convened' with the business equipment and that they agreed to install it for the plaintiff. The Certificate of Installation was complete by October 2007, when the plaintiff entered the formal financing agreement with an unknown vendor. The Defendant supplied the equipment to the plaintiff and installed it. The certificate of installation was never issued to the Plaintiff as there was never a service contract between the companies. The court found that the defendant had completed his part of the transaction and the equipment had been in the plaintiff possession for the past three years. The plaintiffs claim that they signed a document that said they had entered into a financing agreement to supply the business with equipment that was compatible with each other and that the Certificate of Payment was never signed. The defendants have always made their payments to the plaintiffs and it has been in their exclusive possession at all times. While there was a possibility of breach of a contract, the Court found that there had not been any material representation or breach of any obligations by the plaintiff to ensure that the product they were seeking was working for the purposes for which it was intended"
4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal and for inducing breach of contract. The defendants brought three separate causes of action, each of which advanced a fundamental cause of action. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, was advanced by the plaintiffs against the defendant and the second cause of Action, inducing breachof contract, was brought against the plaintiff. HELD: The Court granted the application on the basis of the first two grounds as well as the others. The Court found that the defendants’ pleadings and the statements of media outlets all bore the same character as the plaintiff’s and were plainly material to the plaintiffs’ case. The court found that these particular pleadings did not materially differ from the former rules. The essence and spirit of the current rules do not materially change from the old rules."

Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had separated from the common law wife a few days prior and had been seen by her children. She had called the accused late in the night prior to the offence and said that she was afraid to remain in her home. The Court sentenced the accused to two years and 8 months imprisonment. He did not have a firearm in his possession at the time of the offence.

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","This was an action for the benefit of the plaintiffs children. The mother had been injured in a motor vehicle accident when her car was struck by the defendant's vehicle. The father had attempted to have the mother's child removed from the hospital after undergoing a vasectomy. The daughter had been advised against driving after the procedure due to the adverse effects of the drug. For the mother and her children, this was a judgment call on the part of the nursing staff to determine if she was well enough to leave on her own. The evidence admitted to be correct as to whether the plaintiff should have been allowed to drive. The court referred to a previous opinion by an orthopaedic surgeon that indicated that if the mother was permitted to drive, she would have to do so for 'personal reasons' rather than for general or medical reasons. The surgeon testified that his specialty was to train patients in the fight and flight response to drugs, and that his patients would have a similar reaction if given the opportunity. The female surgeon testified as to the difficulty in finding a parking spot, the difficulty with which she would drive, and the emotional toll that the drugs may have on a patient.

SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused by police, and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person.

5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused, who was charged with sexual assault and pre-sentence report, applied to set aside his guilty plea to count 1, the sexual assault of his son. The charge was based on allegations made against him by his father, a former probation officer, that he had taught his son how to clean his penis, although it had been disclosed to his lawyer. The Crown had proceeded by indictment and the accused had pled guilty to that charge. He had not seen the video of the alleged assault, nor had he seen the statement to the police, but he had heard the accused's father say that when he taught him how to do it, he told his lawyer that he wanted to spare his son's testimony. The accused denied the allegation, but claimed that he did so to save for his son having to take the stand.

5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving a motor vehicle contrary to Criminal Code s.253(1)(a) and (2)having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(1(b) of the Criminal Code and having been found not guilty of both charges. The Crown did not pursue the appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There will be no costs. The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error of law, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual activity with respect to her 8-year-old son. The accused was found in possession of a laptop computer and several pictures were taken of herself and her son. During the search, the police noted that they had located several computers and other devices that could be stored in the possession of the accused. The search also resulted in the discovery of 15 pictures in a Toshiba Satellite laptop computer, which was also a violation of s. 8 of the Charter. The defence argued that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that it was invalid, thereby infringing the accused's Charter rights and that evidence obtained should be excluded. They also alleged that upon arrest or detention the accused would not understand the charge of invitation to sexual touching and that her rights under s. 10(b) were also violated. The Court found that the absence of any relevant information from the computer and the presence of modeling information in the ITO could have led to a conclusion that the accused could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The issue of whether the police could have obtained the pictures and, in particular, if there was an overlap of evidence that would support the findings of the voir dire, the search was illegal. In R. v. Vu, the court found that although there was a possibility of overlap between information and belief, the absence was not sufficient to warrant a complete and complete search of the computer. In this case, the only evidence that could have been obtained was from the mother's contact with a lawyer and the fact that the lawyer was not interviewed by police. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence of sexual assault, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation. The same conclusion could be drawn from the extensive examination of the laptop and the extensive search of its contents that was conducted to determine the validity of the search. There was no evidence as to the precise location of the pictures or their significance. The only relevant information was that the mother had advised her son that she was interested in viewing pictures of herself in the nude and that the pictures were found on a computer and that there were a number of other devices and software capable of storing pictures, including a computer with a camera. The laptop computer was immediately searched for pictures by the RCMP officer on the premises notwithstanding that the warrant to search had specifically stated that police were authorized to search for the said things and to bring them before the court. The police did not refer to the computer as a model of lingerie"

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title had established a good and marketable possessory title to a residential lot adjoining a church property. The plaintiffs brought an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants was without merit. The appellants sought to have the evidence prove possession. Dismissing the application with costs, that the time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The evidence submitted by the vendors was so remote as to be frivolous and as such was not a valid objection to the title. 2)The Court expressed conflicting views as to whether possessory titles may properly be determined under the Limitations of Actions. 3)The Act does not provide a sufficient time period to establish possessory ownership. The Court was satisfied on the basis of the evidence submitted that the vendors, by open, and continuous possession since at least 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a Good and Marketable title to the lot in question. 4)The claim was dismissed. 5)The time period does not exist to establish 40 year provisional possession. 6)The appellants had no evidence that they possessed any land at all. 7)Even if the claim was successful, the Court could not determine the exact location of the 20 or 21 missing feet. 8)The issue of possession was not resolved.

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When the two vehicles came into collision, the defendant failed to yield. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of failure to yield and was fined $8. The court found that the defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded by ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failing of yield it was not possible to say that it was a contributing factor."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. The Public trustee was not served with notices of application for property guardianship and did not intervene in such applications. The practice under the previous legislation was very much ad hoc. If the applicant was from out of the Province or was not a beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, or if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, bonds were usually required. The applicant did not have adequate assets to support a suretyship and many of her siblings did not consent to the application. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a Bond contained in s.55(1). Almost every application would so qualify, because in most cases the nearest relatives always consent. 2) The court has the power under s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship that it considers appropriate, and may also require the property guardian to have the appointment reviewed within a specified period of time. In addition, pursuant to s.54 there is a requirement that the guardian provide an annual accounting to the court and to the public trustee, which the public trustees may investigate to ensure the accuracy of the same. 3) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so."

The appellant appeals. He argues the Rules gave the judge discretion to grant the amendment; and that the judge should have granted it. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the order of the chambers judge and ordering that the appellant be allowed to renew the application; and allowing the proposed new defendant to apply in the Supreme Court, that the decision of the judge on the limitation period is not the same as the decision made in the previous case.

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process.

The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and thus misapplied them. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. The convictions were set aside and the fines and surcharges were restored. 1)The circumstances in this case were such that a court of law appeal could be allowed. The conviction appeal should be allowed as the convictions must stand.  2)The court of appeal should not have been allowed as it went beyond the extent and effect of the judge's decision. The court was of the opinion the operation of the facility fell squarely with the meaning and scope of the provisions. The petitioner was assumed throughout to have been responsible, along with the company, for the operation and manufacture of the log home packages. However, nothing was made of his liability, as distinct form that of his company, either in this Court or in the courts below, so nothing could be taken as having any bearing on whether he needed a license."
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency.

The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment. The appeal revolves around s. 2 of the LCRA. Where land is hereafter sold under an agreement for sale in writing, or mortgaged whether by legal or equitable mortgage for the purpose of securing the purchase price of the land affected, or where mortgage is hereafter given as collateral security for the purchase purchase price, the vendor's or the vendor’s portion of the debt is restricted to the landowner’ s. 25 debt. 2) The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings for placing the interest on the non-Purchase money portion of that debt were examined. 3) The conclusion in Andrew is not binding. 4) The loan obtained by the purchasers and mortgagors in this province were visited with a series of misfortunes over which they had no control economic stagnation. With no legislative protection from creditors, property owners, both urban and rural, faced the prospect of losing their homes and their potential source of livelihood from farming and other occupations. The legislature finally intervened to stem this tide and extended protection to prevent further disaster at the hands of aggressive financial institutions and creditors. 5) Hryneich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. 6) The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take out deficiency judgment against the appellants in $31,160.23."

The Court of Appeal apportioned liability between the Municipality and the Director of Assessment at 50% each. The present action is by the defendants in that first case to recover its legal fees together with some other items of loss and general damages. The specific items of damage claimed as being caused by vandalism or would have occurred in any event to a property left vacant through winter months are dismissed."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. The insurance company claimed that the plaintiff had only worked there for a few months as a bookkeeping clerk before being taken to court. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant and its insurer, pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy, for loss of income. She claimed that she was employed as housekeeper for the insured prior to the accident and that she had not seen the plaintiff for the first six months following the accident. The defendant alleged that the insurance company had prepared a false income report for the plaintiff which was never produced to the court. After examining the insurable earnings report, the court found that the defendant had not provided the plaintiff with the required information as to her employment at the time of the accident; the plaintiff did not appear to have worked there any longer than six months out of the preceding 12 months; and there was insufficient evidence to support the plaintiff's employment claim. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff on the basis of the faulty income report; the defendant was prohibited from seeking recovery of monies paid on the false income statement; and the plaintiff was entitled to costs on the fullness of her claim against the insurer."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.",The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time of trial was an inmate. The police officer testified that he asked the doctor for permission to take the blood and he signed the doctor's certificate. The doctor testified at trial that he had no recollection either of who actually took the blood or of signing the second certificate. HELD: The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life or health of his patient. 1)The facts were in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. 2)The Court was satisfied that the medical practitioner had no real recollection of either of whom actually took blood nor of signing either certificate. 3)There was no evidence to suggest that the attending physician gave consent as to the taking of the blood samples. The Court was not satisfied that either the physician or the technician took the samples under the supervision of the doctor. The evidence was in the Court's View as a whole and the Court was assisted by the Court of Appeal in reviewing the facts. 4)There were no questions as to continuity. The court was satisfied the facts as set out in s.258(1)(h) (supra.) permits proof by certificate of certain matters as setout in the provision and certified by a qualified practitioner. In this case the doctor was granted permission because the doctor held the opinion that the taking for law enforcement reasons would not endanger the life/health of the person. The officer was not prejudiced by the opinion as to whether the doctor signed the certificate.
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","An action for divorce based on separation. In issue were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance and division of the matrimonial home. The petitioner sought costs. HELD: 1)The marriage breakdown was established. The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. The divorce was granted.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the husband. Maintenance for the couple's two children was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 3)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of $21,804.38 to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner and the petitioner was ordered to keep the children on his group insurance benefit plan so long as they are eligible and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for such period as they continued to be child of the marriage as defined in the Act. 4)Spousal support was reviewed by the Court on the ordinary ground of material change in circumstances. No costs were awarded."

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order in response to a variation application by the father that reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. The father had filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information, 10 months out of date and he was in default of the disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He argued that the judge erred in principle by allowing the father's application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. HELD: Appeal allowed in part; dismissal of the application without prejudice to his bringing a new variation application on proper material. The mother did not request costs; the court ordered that the father provide the mother with a copy of his income tax return, completed and with all attachments, even if the return is not filed, along with all notices of assessment received from Revenue Canada on or before June 1st of each year."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol (under s. 253(1)(a) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08) and with failing to stop for police as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court was satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused's alcohol consumption that evening and early morning. It was not satisfied that he had a reasonable excuse for not stopping. Based on the evidence, the accused was drinking beer steadily over the hours before he drove and his BAC at the time of driving was determined to be between 15 and 91 mg%. The accused's evidence, together with expert opinion evidence, raised a reasonable doubt that he was not trying to evade the police officer. The accused’s evidence was not accepted. The court found that the accused”s level of intoxication was in the reasonable range and he required an ASD test to give him the grounds to make an Intoxilyzer demand."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. In concurrence, the Court read out the reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. HELD: The Queen’s Bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to make a requirement, as an addition to the Actus Reus for a offence under ss.213(1(c)) of the code. This was an error in law and was cited as a correct test in R. v. Schmidt (1987), 1986 CanLII 3096 (SK QB), 53 Sask. R. 75 at pp. 77-78. Applying these principles to the present case, it is my view that the facts before the learned Chief Judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female person forthe purpose of exchanging in an act of sexual intercourse and for which he intended to pay. The evidence is that the Respondent approached a woman unknown to him in an area where prostitutes were plying their trade, invited her into his automobile, inquired if she was interested in sex and wanted to know if the police officer was a police officer. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude the jury from reasonably concluding that a prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. It was strongly urged by the Crown, and conceded by the defence, that this is the correct test. The same test was used in Rachman v. Kramer (1986) and was applied here in the Province of Saskatoon."

The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity.

The defendant applied to set aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s.102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. 1)The wording in s. 102(a) of the act is indistinguishable from the wording in S. 143(1) of The Vehicles Act, 1983.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform under the contracted contract. The defendant counterclaimed for monies it had already been paid and extras for services it had performed under the contracts. The contractual obligation to maintain and service the banks, ditches, railway and equipment was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contract between the parties and, therefore, was not inconsequential. The court found that the contractual obligations arising out of the losses were not as extensive as they would have been if the wording had been in the original invitation for tender."

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one-day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: break and enter a dwelling house; theft; jewellery; break and enters; break-and-enter; theft. HELD: 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for a penitentiary sentence. The judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December 1999. She further considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. 2)The sentencing judge was of the view community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the offender. However, the conditional provision of sentence of 2 years less 1 day imposed was not considered necessary until the offender had finished his sentence."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","The plaintiff commenced his class action in June 2006 against the defendants and third parties. The defendants appealed that decision and applied to stay the action pending review by the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The applicants applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff's claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. They argued that the actions were an abuse of the court's process and that the court had the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. The Court referred to the recent amendments to the Sask. Act which provide for a discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Queen’s Bench Rules and/or Rule 173 of the Queens’ Bench Rules. HELD: The Court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were addressed in the preliminary application. The application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and time. The court reviewed the circumstances before it and found that s. 6 of the Act was applicable. The Saskatchewan Act does not provide an appropriate remedy for this type of application. As the Act is presently undergoing a refresh, the Court was cognizant of the fact that the application could be brought at any time in any of the jurisdictions except Newfoundland and Labrador. As a result, the court was unable to determine whether the action should be stayed permanently or in interim. The applications to stay were dismissed."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 and the mother was concerned that he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child. The mother also alleged that the father had threatened her with removal and that she should seek help from Veith House to obtain a passport for her child. Father not to be under the influence of marijuana; the mother's allegation is unsubstantiated; there is no evidence he has used marijuana while in the care of the mother; the father has not used it in the manner prescribed by the court in this case; the relationship between the parties was one factor to be considered. Both parties had an opportunity to prevent escalation and the father could have taken the jacket and left without getting into a tug-of-war with the mother. HELD: 1)The evidence did not suggest that the Father understood the nutritional requirements of the child this age and therefore concerned about the meals he might prepare. 2)The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child 3)The court reviewed the various tools available to assess credibility. The court found that, given that the mother had stopped living with the father and that he had stopped using marijuana, there was a real risk that the child would be at risk of harm if left in his care unsupervised. 3)A straightforward test was applied to determine whether joint custody or joint custody was appropriate. 4)The test was used to determine what temporary living arrangements were the least disruptive, most supportive and most protective for the children. 5)The respondent was not prepared to participate in any type of supervised exercise. The child's best interests, on an interim basis, were to be to be in the sole custody of her Mother."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis for the maximum contact principle alone to order shared parenting. 2) The evidentiary record as controverted as it is, is not lacking to the point where the Chambers Judge had no proper basis for her decision.  3) There must be a sufficient evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence. The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the judge to decline to make an assessment of the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed. 4) The father argues that the Chambers judges, in making her determination, considered only the impact on the status quo of the change in circumstances when she should have considered the entirety of the children’s current situation. There is no error made by the judge on this issue. The Chambers Judge was entitled not only to take into account the change of status quo, but was required to do so as part of her broader consideration of the Children”s needs and circumstances. This was not the case here. The chambers judge did not properly consider the principle of maximum contact. The Court was unable to draw any appropriate conclusions from her analysis of the whole evidence."

He was sentenced to 18 months to be served concurrently with the theft charge. He appealed his sentence on the grounds it was unfair.

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal set aside; conviction entered on the charge of assault causing bodily harm. Both counsels for the respondent sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds that there was no medical evidence to support finding that the respondent had the minimal intent required for an offence of common assault. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the trial judge erred in law in failing to direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as a result of the appellant's degree of intoxication, that there had been an assault and that he had the requisite intent to perform the actus reus of the offence because his state of awareness was akin to automatism or insanity."

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","Division of matrimonial property. Husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm as he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. Wife filed motion to vary Spousal Maintenance Order in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation. HELD: 1)The respondent was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division of matrionial property and in addition the wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousals Maintenance Order made in November. 2)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 3)Division based on asset values at this stage problematical. The petitioner required income to live on and the barley fell into that category. He paid one half of the net proceeds to his wife which covered the maintenance payments ordered for November, December, January and $300 of the $1,100 payment which came due in February. He was now in arrears $4,100. 4)The wife was entitled to the following set-off to be included in her share of the matrimonial property division: 5)Car payments made, unpaid maintenance 800. 1)Legal fees $6,600. The remainder of the farm assets including the remaining farm lands, the parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy.  5)Discretion by the husband in allowing the wife's claim for set off was granted since it was not possible to determine at this point in time how much either of the parties could hope to recover from the equal division of the property pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act.  6)The court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and 44% to the wife. 7)The parties jointly owned $97,000 in assets. 8)Each side was to bear their own costs."
9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an order restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing and thereby interfering with the lawful use and improvement of the plaintiff's premises. The defendants granted an order abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action. The plaintiff's right to trade was infringed by the picketers as they were obstructing the entrances of the defendants' buildings and attempting to interfere with the plaintiff employment contract. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The acts complained of were illegal and had caused and continue to cause damage to the plaintiff including damage to his or her business's reputation. 2)The right of the respondents to engage in a primary picketing of an employer not directly involved in a labour dispute was restrained. 3)The delay in the delivery of materials was considered. 4)The picketers were in possession of a large amount of a videotape which had been removed by the plaintiff and displayed their affiliation with a union. 5)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the application. 6)The injunction was stayed pending the trial on the ground that the acts constituted illegal picketing. 7)No costs were awarded.
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  The defendants claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under Sec. 15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The defendants were found not guilty of all charges.  2) There was no evidence that the defendants, or anyone they may have related to, had ever tried to circumvent the by-laws or that they had ever sought or sought permission to build anything on the reserve. 3) The defendant’s claim that the bylaw respecting the use of the reserve was invalid was not supported by the evidence. The court found that the defendant had not obstructed the view of the public at large, nor had there been any breach of the by law, and therefore, the charges were stayed."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable.","The accused appealed the Summary Conviction Appeal Court decision ordering a new trial on seven counts against them under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act and (failing) to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. 1) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that is that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus the trial judges properly considered the issues of income before dealing with mens rea. 2) The Crown argued the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either SCC or this Court. 3) In Pursuant to R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 (SK CA), the Court of Appeal is to determine whether the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous.

9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act. The trial judge found that the respondent did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s. 29(1). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: The issue is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. The Court of Appeal relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., which found that Lanson authorized the dealing. The security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. It follows that the security interest only continued in the title and title and the purchaser's dealer did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Property Registry. The Credit union appeals this. Issues: 1) The respondent clearly gave the secured creditor (Lanson) an express authority to dealwith the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured debtor does not invalidate the sale to the purchaser. 2) The appellant relied heavily upon Canadian commercial bank. It was restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the securedparty. The Security Interest in the Land does not continue when a secured party expressly or impliedly authorizes the dealing or is authorized to sell the property. In this case the respondent obtained financing by Credit Union. The credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security Interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle are restricted to the proceeds; It is not necessary for us, given the express authorization by Lanson to the credit Union to deal With the Security, to determine whether one could find on the facts that there was an implied authorization to deal"

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant.

The plaintiffs sought legal advice and were granted an order disallowing the limitation defence. The action itself was not issued until July 1998. The plaintiff subsequently admitted to the fact that she had been aware of the uncle's identity several years earlier. Judgment for the plaintiffs dismissed. The reasonableness argument for disallallowing a limitation defence was that it was based on double hearsay from the defendant, who alleged that he was the driver of the vehicle when the accident took place some 25 years earlier and not Vincent LeLacheur. The defendant had pled and relied on the Statute of Limitations, a provision of the Fatal Injuries Act which preserved an action by those persons entitled to benefit under its provisions, but did not provide a satisfactory evidentiary basis upon which to make a finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant."

Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The appellants sought and were granted leave to appeal. They appealed the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which held that the decisions of the Board constituted an abuse of process and that the application should never have been brought. Allowing the appeal, that the issue of Crown immunity is not plain and obvious in this case. The question of whether the respondent, in laying the information, was cloaked with Crown immunity, was unclear in law, and was not a basis for striking out the statement of Claim under Rule 14.(1)(a).

The plaintiff had also been involved in some type of poultry raising. 5)There was no information as to what if any other offers had been received in the last year or so. 6)The Court was not comfortable setting an upset price for the sale at $60,000. The farmers had cleared off most of the debt associated with the ostrich enterprise except for the Bank of Nova Scotia and the execution holders on title. The Court was unable to find that the farm land in 1988 was not a homestead within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 7)It was not reasonable to adjourn the application to June 2001 at a time to be set by the local registrar."
9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, contrary to s 155 of the Code, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications for DNA warrant applications with respect to the baby and its mother refer to a blood sample obtained from a confidential source. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the 19- year old female and thus there is nothing to negative any suggestion that the father and mother of the baby are'strangers' genetically speaking. DNA Warrants Analysis of s.485(1)(a) – Review of existing applications – Summary of information obtained in accordance with s.476.5 of the code. In light of the novel nature of the applications, the court was of the view that a DNA warrant application with respect the baby would be premature but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised that it is so advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the words in s.488(1(b)(iv) is that a biological sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationships has been obtained from within its body and is of sufficient probative value as it is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. The mother is obviously not in any position to give an informed consent, instruct counsel, or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.487.07. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the child's blood. While it may be appropriate at some point to order the baby's blood sample be obtained notwithstanding any parental non-consent, it is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. In the meantime, there are a number of significant deficiencies in the Information in Support which would need to be remedied if further consideration were to be given to the applications. Deficiencies in the Information in Support relating to the probative benefits of DNA analysis do not preclude issuance of a warrant. In respect of the bodily substances in the possession or control of the Crown, there is no other bodily substance which relates to"
9_2003skqb459.txt,"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession with intent to traffic in a motor vehicle with a view to trafficking. The Crown alleged that the accused's s. 8, 9 and 10 Charter rights were infringed because she did not enter that in any of the four documents prepared by the RCMP. HELD: The evidence was excluded from the trial.  1) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. If the aroma of liquor or drug is evident, the question becomes one of the proper test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. 2) The evidence established that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by the officer provided more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest. The Court rejected the defence argument that the officer, upon smelling the marijuana, then had reasonable grounds to conduct a warrantless search, echo and rely on the comments of Tallis J.A. in R. v. Ladouceur, 1997 CanLII 320 (SCC), at 1) 1) The Court recognized that the presence of marijuana in vehicles can only be found with the aid of a flashlight and it is incidental to check for sobriety, licences, insurance and the mechanical fitness of the cars. The police use of check stops should not be used as means of conducting either an unfounded general inquisition or an unreasonable search. Random stop programs must not be turned into means of searching for either an unreasonable or incidental search."
9_2004nssf51.txt,"After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material. The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The petitioner received a letter in which he stated that he was not served with the Applicant's application and supporting material. The court had previously received from the applicant that he had until the 23rd of April to contact the petitioner. The petitioner returned the Court's calls and although he did not make himself available for the telephone conference and was not available for cross examination, his affidavit was struck and he was entitled to additional costs in the sum of $250. The Court also received a copy of the affidavit from the affidavit vendor. HELD: The petitioner is entitled to costs over $1,000 for the total of $550.00, inclusive of disbursements. The affidavit is struck as being without merit and the court is not able to verify the affidavit's credibility. The applicant is entitled in the amount of $350 for additional costs. The costs of discharging the petitioner's disbursement are also increased by $250 to reflect the time that the Court had to prepare for the phone conference and the time it took preparing the affidavit."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing two orders of the Board made in May 2004 and June 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The Board has conceded that two exceptions to the general rule that an error of law must appear on the face of the record are that it has not done indirectly what it cannot do directly, namely to authorize the discovery and production of documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was without jurisdiction to do so. Wal- Mart Canada also applies for a stay pending the hearing of this decision and a further court order. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the Record.  1) The Board admitted that it had not reviewed the transcript as it was not available to the Court apart from the parties' written submissions. It had reviewed the transcripts several times and was satisfied that the transcript was properly prepared. 2) There were virtually no reasons given by the Board as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW, that it rejected all the submissions made by it. It was beyond the scope of the judgment to review and comment on the relevancy of the documents sought. 3) There was no evidence that the Board was seeking to abuse its powers or that it infringe the freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the Charter. 4) The application for discovery and document production was commenced and the Board adjourned for a few minutes to consider its position. It did not meet the onus on it to decide whether to pursue the Charter challenge or whether to simply compel the applicant to produce the documents referred to by the subpoenas and that the documents may well be relevant to the issues that are properly before the Court. The onus will be on the Board to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to order the discovery of documents and to make the disclosure and production orders in the manner in which it has done so. It is not in dispute that the board has adopted pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended, contending that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, and by rejecting in total the evidence of only one Crown witness, a police officer, and three other civilian witnesses. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove that the appellant was in fact the driver of the vehicle; and other grounds as may appear from the record. The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. It remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot reasonably be supported. The Crown has established a prima facie case, having proved all the elements of the offence necessary for conviction, and on the basis of the acceptable evidence heard, it is reasonable to order a new trial."

The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.",The parties to this action signed handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: The plaintiff is to provide labor and equipment necessary to feed and maintain the cows for a set price of $0.50 per day per cow. The defendant receives an invoice for any feed that they get to pasture. The plaintiff then sends monthly invoices to the defendant who pays the total cost of the feed. The parties then conduct their business together according to the terms of the 2004 agreement. The cost of labour is raised to 60 cents per day. Another sixty calves were delivered to the plaintiff's pastures in the spring and summer. Another 60 calves were brought to the plaintiffs' pastures. Benson is to care for the cows as well as the calves as they are born. In the year 2005-2006 he did not contemplate payment of bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May. He agreed in cross-examination that bonus was requested by the plaintiff which he refused to pay. No bonus was paid for the 2005-06 year except for eight hundred dollars. HELD: The Court held that the agreement between the parties that the plaintiff was to pay the defendant the sum of $900 for each live calf that he got to pasture was not enforceable. The Court ordered that the defendant pay the plaintiff $850 for the 2008 feed.
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert (the 'City') with certain conditions. Although the demolition order was dated November 18, 2004, legal proceedings have extended the life of the building. The building was at the time of the respondent's demolition. The respondent sought and was granted a period of 6 months from the date of the decision to bring forward a written proposal to the Board committing to the operation of the Building under a qualified professional property management firm with a proven record and acting at arm's length to the respondent. The board determined the order to vacate and to demolish was appropriate and continues to be appropriate. The Board suspended enforcement of the order for 6 months to allow the respondent to remedy the underlying problems. HELD: The appeal was dismissed on all grounds. The City had not proven that the board lacked jurisdiction to decide as it did. The Court found that the Board had not demonstrated that it was in a position to decide on the disclosure of the police files and that it would be incumbent on the applicant to pursue other avenues including application to the Court for subpoena or other Order directing production of documents. The Order to Vacate and Demolish was confirmed and remained in place subject to the conditions set out in the City's Notice of Appeal. It was not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they did not consider relevant at the date the decision was made."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The applicant's grounds of appeal were not questions of estoppel or collateral attack but of whether the Chambers judge erred in finding there was no abuse of processes. The application was in the nature of a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and/or the inherent control of the court, therefore s. 24 of SCAN does not apply."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? The evidence of the two accused and their daughter was consistent with active participation. The evidence raised reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent and whether the accused had an honest or mistaken belief as consent."

After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count one.  1) The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The Court found little if any evidence to support the charge. The observations made by the officer from engaging the accused in a conversation at the door are very similar to the ones made in the Rogers case. 2) The unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and 9 affected the accused”s privacy, liberty, and human dignity. 3) The officer did not ask the officer in and as I have said in the past, but she did ask him to come around the house so she did not lose eye contact with her. The officer” s accompanying her around the home and the actions outside of the home in full view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. The implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant' (at 18). The Vanwick case was still good law and the leading case on Section challenges. Although it did not find the officer behaviour egregious, it did find the Charter breach serious."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The parties were in a spousa relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband had a children from a prior relationship for whom he pays support. During the relationship the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment. During this time the husband secured full-time employment with CN. The wife has resided with extended family members, most recently her mother, with the result that she has no costs for housing. Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each former spouse in the immediate post-separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in affordability of lifestyles of the former spouses, spousousal and support is the appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities. The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997, F-6.3. 2) The net assets for distribution should exceed the amount requested. The husband does not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states she has failed to demonstrate need for support at this time. She has not demonstrated that she is unable to afford support. Interim Spousal Support: The Conley factors were succinctly summarized by Ryan-Froslie J. (as she was then) in Geransky Geransky, 2012 SKQB 218 (CanLII), and have been repeatedly cited and applied. 3) The Court has authority in order to order such an order pursuant to ss. 26 and 26 of the FAMPA. The Court must look at the economic situation in which the net assets in a given situation exceed the amounts requested. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousals rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband. 4) The court does not prescribe separate considerations, factors and objectives for interim support as opposed to final determination. The paramount issue is whether the wife has shown a need to support. The parties are in a situation where net assets far exceed the extent of the interim distribution requested. This should be considered when there is no significant economic adjustment to the original means and circumstances of each spouse. The economic adjustment must be appropriate at the appropriate time. Only an economic adjustment can be established in the context of a reasonable and reasonable"

HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.","This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 346 and an order set aside allgarnishee summonses issued pursuant to Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act. The applicants had filed an application to set aside the garnishee sues pursuant to s. 3(2) of the Attachment Of Debts act and for an Order setting aside all existing garnishees and warrants pursuant to ss. 7 and 10 of the Act. HELD: The application toset aside the defaults judgment and the writ of execute was dismissed. 1)The applicants had clearly shown that they had a good defence on the merits to the garnisihee summons.  2)The application for payment out of all of the monies paid into court pursuant to the sues under Rule 346 was premature and was therefore dismissed without prejudice to re-apply.  3)The sufficiency of the affidavits in preparing the affidavit for the garnihee summons was not sufficient to set them aside. The affidavit for garnislee summons was inconsistent with s. 2(2). The deponent swears positively to the indebtedness of the defendants by counterclaim and states that to the best of the deponent's information and belief, the named proposed garnisher is indebted to the defendants."
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of an arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee as well as a letter of understanding between the applicant and the union that employees would notify the company if they were to be absent from work due to illness or other reason. The respondent was terminated as anemployee in 1993. The Board found that based on the respondent's employment record and the evidence presented at the hearing, the termination was a culminating incident. The penalty of discharge was a suspension without pay for 16 months. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The patently unreasonable test is absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The penalty imposed on the applicant was a suspended without pay pending review by the Arbitration Board. 4)The applicant took issue with the fact that the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment history the final incident justified termination of his employment. 5)The application was treated as asuspension without pay until the completion of the 16 month period from August 1993 to the date that this Award was to be treated assuspension."
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by the plaintiff. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether the plaintiff suffered from injuries caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court answered the question as to the causation of the plaintiffs injuries.  1)Did the collision cause or contribute to any ofthe plaintiff's injuries or damage? 2)Had the defendant been a medical doctor, he would have been qualified to diagnose injuries. The Court would have found the defendant to be a qualified expert in the field of biomechanics. 3)The Court was not prepared to accept the defendants' expert opinion as to cause or mitigate the damage."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. This is because the debt at the time fixed for payment is conditional upon the vendors being able to make title, and where he has no title the purchase-money never becomes payable. This argument mixes two different streams of the law of garnishment: the law pertaining to 'conditional debts' and the law dealing with the garnishment of notes. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The first type of debt not held to be subject to condition and held to to be garnishable is that arising between a financial institution and a debtor. 2)Garnishment is not the only branch of the legal system which can be rationalized. 3)The conditional nature of the debt such as that of a GIC is not a separate category from the others. A garnishment summons is not sufficient to prevent garnishment. 4)Graftishment is a conditional debt which must be paid to the debtor within 30 days of its maturity. 5)Gust garnishment is prevented because of a conditional one and made so by reason of assignment."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The sales agent for Allstate was terminated as a result of a two-year, non-competition clause in his employment contract which provided for monthly compensation based on the net written premium on new policies written during the previous month together with renewal compensation calculated using the average renewals for the prior two quarters. The contract provided for a two year period in which the compensation was to be calculated pro-rated in accordance with the number of renewals received. The termination of the sales agent's employment contract provided that he would receive no less than $1,800 per month for the first two years, and pro-rating for the subsequent two years at that time, at a rate of 25% to 30% for those renewals. Although he had worked in the insurance industry for 26 years, the plaintiff had no business dealings with persons other than his former employer and had not been compensated for his employment with Allstate.HELD: 1)Where the employer seeks to enforce the 'non competition' clause, of which this is not in dispute, it must recognize this may constitute a factor in determining whether or not the terminated employee has made reasonable efforts to seek and obtain alternative employment. In this case, the conduct of the terminated agent was not unreasonable and did not constitute a failure by the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. 2)The termination of Allstate's contract with the plaintiff was not a failure as he had no month for which he was not compensated. Rather, the termination of all of the plaintiff's business prospects were not as great as they had been in the past and the restrictions against contacting former clients would be offset against the anticipation of long-term benefits in establishing his own business."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preservingand detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)The applicants failed to meet the first and second tests of a prima facie case, the irreparable harm which could result if the orders were not granted, and the need for positive steps at the interlocutory stage. 2)Saskatchewan courts rarely grant a mandatory injunction. If, however, a plaintiff shows a very strong probability that a property will decline in value, the court must order that the proceeds of such actions be paid to that plaintiff. 3)The Court of Appeal held that the applicants had not met the third test, the test of irreparable damage which must be proven in a negative injunction application. The Court of Queen's Bench Rule 39 granted permission for the application pursuant to s. 91(2) of the Queen's Block Rules.

An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident.

The insurer refused to reimburse the plaintiff for the repair and claimed loss of the engine under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. 1)An express election is not necessary. If the insurer wishes to reinstate, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. 2)The claim was not brought by the plaintiff but by the insurer of a motor vehicle registered to him. The automobile was inspected by the owner of the vehicle, the certificate of registration was issued to him and he was directed to repair the vehicle. 3)An election to repair is not an election. The statements of fact filed by the insureds as to the amount of depreciation are not considered election results. 4)If the insurer elected to repair, it will be liable for the entire cost of the repair, whether it exceeds the limits placed on the statutory condition of repair by the statute. 5)The insurer may elect to reinstall or replace the exhaust system under a statutory condition 7(4). 6)The Court referred to the claim in Lepin v.

The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed.

Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and the separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff.

She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992.

She underwent a successful hysterectomy, but was returned to the operating room where the defendant eventually had to perform ahysterestomy. The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were based on the defendant's conclusion that the likely cause of the bleeding was retained products of conception. The defendant's credibility was challenged on the issue of whether he actually performed the D & C, a procedure which the plaintiff alleges would have remedied the bleeding, and in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hystrectomy."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge dismissed a summary conviction appeal on the ground that he was unable to determine whether the alleged offences occurred when the accused was a young person or an adult.

The Crown argued that, once an information alleges an offence occurred when a young offender, the youth court judge has jurisdiction to embark on the inquiry. The defence agreed that, in the absence of proof as to when the offences actually occurred, that it should be ordered to an adult court where the evidence of the accused's age at the time of the alleged offence was most favourable to the accused.

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children.

The petitioner sought to vary the 1993 order by cancelling $13.273. 39 in maintenance payment accrued under that order and by canceling $5000 on account of arrecars accrued prior to December 31, 1998. HELD: 1)The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the order and therefore was not prepared to reduce the arreaars. 2)The amount of the outstanding arrear was $22,993. The court directed that upon the payment $5000 of the interest on the remaining $5,ars accrued pursuant to that order, the balance of arrenars accrued before such date was extinguished. 3)The court ordered that the petitioner have access on a full weekend between 6:00 pm to 6:30 pm on Friday and 2 weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend for the purposes of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4)Access was not a problem in the past.

When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)Each doctor was a doctor. The dominant and overriding obligation of each doctor was to provide continuous care to his patients, as said, 24 hours day, seven days week. It was permitted by the hospital that this obligation could be performed by a fellow doctor having privileges in the hospital but the obligation itself always remained with each individual doctor. 2)There was no evidence either in fact or in law supporting a trust or a relationship between the doctors or the defendant. 3)Discretion was exercised by the doctors not to enter into an arrangement which compromised the hospital's statutory and contractual obligations to deliver the patient care to the hospital. 4)The court dismissed the action against the doctor who had refused to attend upon him for several days because he was not a party to the arrangement.  5)The common characteristics defining a fiduary relationship were discussed by Cameron J.A. in Baskerville v. Thurgood, 1992 CanLII 8313 (SK CA), [1992] W.W.R. 193 (Sask. C.A.) at 203: As the judgments in LAC Minerals, supra, suggest, actions founded in breach of fiduciaries fall to be determined along these lines: (1)Was the relationship between all the medical practitioners having privileges to practise in a hospital to be on- call to answer the needs of patients admitted by him or her on a continuous basis, 24 hour day and 7 days week, and to respond to emergencies? (2)Did the conduct complained of fall within the scope thereof, and (iii) did it constitute breach? (IV) What remedies are available and which is appropriate? 6)Pursuant to the Accused's Charter and the Saskatchewan Medical Standards, the Court found that there was no breach of the Accreditors' Charter by virtue of the fact that the Act was brought into force by the legislature."

The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time.

The applicant asserted that he was ready for trial and that he had been for a considerable period of time. The respondent vigorously opposed severance on the grounds that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between Canada and the applicant. HELD: The order of severance sought was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial. 1)The applicant was granted an order to sever the issues from those raising in the cross claim and third-party proceedings.  2)The plaintiff was stalling in the pursuit of resolution of the issues. It was in the best interests of justice that the order of security sought by the applicant should be granted so the issue in the actions may proceed at an early date. 3)The actions pending the resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules.
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner was attending university and the respondent ceased paying support for the children. HELD: 1) The mother was attending classes at a university and all her needs were met. The father was working part-time and living expenses were not included in the table amount. The table amount of support for both children was $1,153 per month. It was determined that the child was meeting his obligation to contribute to his own support by student loans and the contribution of his father from his part- time employment. The Table amount of child support for support for each child was determined based upon the full extent of the father's obligation and determined presumptively, irrespective of the child's actual needs. 2) The children were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. The court declined to find the chamber judge in error. 3) The Court was satisfied that the respondent misapplied s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of s.3(2(b)(ii). The children had demonstrated that they were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and had the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendants’ case is submitted through the affidavit of Nordstrom. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of the negligence by the defendant. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the Date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. The claim against Nordstrom was dismissed. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant and had a business relationship with Mayer, he was intimately familiar with the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased”s intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. Nordstrom’”professional”s knowledge of the death of the client and his failure to advance products that would meet that intent and his reliance on Mayer fathoming that beneficiary designation made was void in law, all evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge its duty of care to its client and consequently, his negligence."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident. He was treated at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital by a doctor with an extensive medical knowledge and skills. During the course of the action, the plaintiff suffered from severe cervical pain and other symptoms, a cervical x-ray was taken, a spinous process fracture and a disk herniation. The plaintiff's mother died shortly after the plaintiff's operation. At trial, the doctor suggested that the plaintiff should have used a more appropriate imaging device, as it would have stabilized the injured site by the application of internal fixators or clamps. The applicant's expert testified that he believed there were three major contributing factors to the congenitally narrow spinal canal, two of which were the same as the cervical fixating devices, and three were those inserted by the plaintiff.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs live adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. Until recently the defendant golf course was owned and operated by the defendant, Emerald Park. In January 2005, the property was purchased by the Townof White City who entered into an agreement with Great Plains and Lorch Associates Ltd. for the continued operation of their golf course, which also included a provision that prohibits the use and enjoyment of the plaintiffs' property by golfers who shoot their balls into their yards. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years. 2) The Court is not prepared to order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's.66(3) the Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VEH)'. The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction declared void because the charge was not a nullity. 1)The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges. The Crown was given an opportunity to file an appeal. The appeal could not be allowed because the Court had not reviewed the pleadings and the certificate of offence provided by the appellant.  2)The appeal should be allowed as the charge is so palpley that it does not give a fair and proper basis to disturb the conviction entered or the fine imposed.  3)The count is anullity and is void ab initio.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of the aggravated assault on the complainant and in the information, being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his undertakings. The Court also found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which takes him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was acquitted of both counts of assault on a police officer. The court considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt on count 1.

He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed.

It ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen’’S Bench Rules. It found that due deference should be given to the board with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. To do so would result in s. 3.3 of Bylaw No. being in contravention of s. 41 of the Act and that is prohibited by s. 47 of the legislation. As there were only seven positions on the Board, the board was composed of seven members. The applicant had used special rights as set out in s3.3(c) and s3(e) of the Bylaw respecting the election of directors and the voting rights of the commercial owners. He also argued that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of condominium bylaws.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four actions were originally brought by the same defendants. The defendants responded to the same motion on behalf of the plaintiff. In each action, each plaintiff claims that the investment advisor personally responsible for their accounts was Mr. Bagnell. Each plaintiff is seeking the same type of financial damages, along with 'aggravated, punitive and exemplary damages'. The issues to be heard together are: 1) common law authority; 2) whether the pleadings and submissions of the Counsel should suffice; 3) whether expert evidence will be called in relation to each claim; 4) whether there is overlap in terms of duplication of content; and 5) whether experts are called to prove and quantify the aggravated damages claimed in the four actions. In all actions, the court will be tasked at looking at the degree of commonality between the actions. There will be common issues and facts, but there is not a sufficient basis for deciding whether consolidation is appropriate; and 6) the court must consider all of the possible outcomes, including the costs, benefits, and costs of the trials."

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the Buckwold Bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application under s. of The Contributory negligence act would result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence.

b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgement, or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The respondent is required to make an equalization payments of $105,000 to the respondent. If the respondent chooses to rollover the money, the amount of RRSP funds to be transferred must be increased by a factor of 1.3. This is to account for the taxable nature of the RRSPs and for the remaining family debts.  2) The wife's outline of the family property and debts provides the necessary context for an appreciation of the discussions that followed, and it is therefore necessary to outline the calculations in some detail. 3) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSP to adjust for tax implications. He argues that RRSP assets should be significantly discounted to reduced after tax cash value as at the date of division. The petitioner shall have judgment as against the respondent in this amount. Should the respondent choose to roll over the monies to satisfy the Equalization payment, the court must increase the amount in the same manner as the agreement. This will account for all of the taxable income of the husband. 4) The parties were urged to try and resolve the matter themselves. They were unable to do so."

The complainant and her sister both testified at trial that they had not experienced sexual intercourse prior to the accused being in custody. The accused was acquitted on both charges.

b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by applying the incorrect mens rea and actus reus to the offence. The Court of Appeal found that the Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). HELD: The appeal is dismissed. In this case the Crown must satisfy the Court with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the trial had been held to be of more objective quality. The trial judge did not confuse the issue of the appellant's speed with either the actus or mens Reus. The court was not satisfied that the crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the speed of the accused's vehicle was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances. The accused was acquitted of all three alleged errors of law. The jurisprudence currently recognizes four situations in which an error of law can be made. The first is an honest mistake. The second is a mistake of mistaken identity, which is not accepted by the Court. The third error is correctness. The Supreme Court of Canada held that in light of the Crown’s stated position that the appellant’ speed needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, it was not a question of fact for the appellant to mistake the elements of the offence for dangerous driving. While the Court was aware of the issue at trial, it did not mistake it for a matter of fact. As the appellant had been travelling well over 100 km/hr at the time of the accident, he did not misdirect himself as to the speed. The appellant was travelling at a reasonable speed when he lost control of his vehicle and did not have to slow down to avoid an accident. The evidence of several witnesses who testified that they saw two cars that slowed down immediately in front of the car, but no actual construction involving workers or equipment was in the area at the moment of the crash. The appeal court found that this is not a case where the appellant would have been more likely to have lost control and been in a situation where there was no construction activity in the immediate area. The error of fact is not the only one to be considered. The case law requires correctness."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s.35.1. The Director's application was not statute barred and there was no limitations issue.  1)The applicant was not seeking to forfeit goods seized prior to the coming into force of s.2009 Act. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature and it is not intended to be a remedy. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 2)There was no retroactivity problem. The evidence on the seized property only became 'proceeds of unlawful activity' because of the unlawful activity. The door was breached on the third attempt and the police entered the premises. Once inside the house, Sergeant McDonald heard toilet running as if it had just been flushed and the cell phone rang again. The police did not see any drugs or traces of drugs in the home. No drug residue was ever found around the toilet nor were any drugs found elsewhere in the house. 3)The Court found no evidence that the property was the proceeds of unlawful activities. The Act does not provide that the Director can be charged with a criminal offence for failing to obtain more controlled substances for the purpose of trafficking. The statute operates retrospectively. 4)The Director was granted the legal effect vis-a-vis the respondent's application that it was brought under the 2009 legislation. The Court found that the application could not be set aside based on the expiration of the limitation period. It merely set out the test the court must apply in determining whether to order forfeiture of seized property."

The applicant argued that there were significant areas where the interests of the bank conflicted with interests of the creditors. The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application by the applicant for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the bankrupt to act as custodian of the estate and as a creditor. The Bank had refused to fund the bankruptcy and the estate sought independent legal advice on the merits of the action. The trustee opposed the application and sought the removal of the counsels. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A clear distinction must be drawn between the duties and obligations of a receiver-manager appointed under the terms of a debenture and one appointed by a court. In the former case, the trustee becomes an officer of the court and acts in a fiduciary capacity to all parties involved in the litigation. 2)This conflict of interest is so blatant that it demands the removalof present counsel. This is an application to consider the Supreme Court of Canada decision in MacDonald Estate v. Martin Rossmere Holdings (1970) which held that a trustee should not be represented by counsel for a bankrupt estate when there is a real prospect of conflict between the parties. 3)The Trustee was to consider all of the situations in which a solicitor could be appointed to represent a creditor in the event of a dispute between a trustee and a debtor. 4)The applicant was to present his claim for solicitor fees, the amount of which would be paid by the trustee to the estate inspectors, and the solicitor's role in preparing the report."

c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from a shop. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he inadvertently placed his finger in front of the nozzle. The defendant claimed that warning was unnecessary because the dangers associated with placing a finger on a sprayer nozzle would be well known to the ordinary, prudent person. This was especially so here where the non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. Damages for pain and suffering and loss ofamenities of life were at $10,000. In addition, the plaintiff claimed loss of income, past and future.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $18,789.50 plus costs and pre-judgment interest on $10k from January 1989 to December 1990. This interest was limited because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for a further trial more expeditiously and not been denied benefit for the years in which he did not vigorously prosecute his claim."

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1994. There were two children of the marriage, Chad, born in 1976 and 1978. The parties were engaged throughout the marriage and had two children, Chad and Ryan. Chad was in high school and was dependant on the mother. Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the mother had been employed and the child support payments had been reduced. HELD: 1)The mother was to pay child support for the child in her name as child support and the matrimonial home was to be sold. 2)The father was to have his pension from 24 years of service transferred to a locked-in RRSP in his name. 3)The wife was to receive the commuted value of his pension in her own name. 4)The child support order was granted whereby the mother was ordered to provide the mother with written notice that she wanted the maximum allowable commuted valued transferred to RRSP. If the mother could not provide the written notice in the time provided, then there would be an order for the monthly pension benefit to be paid to the father. 5)The court determined that there was no order for spousal support nor for child support in the circumstances."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order of a Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or with a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of words s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power to makes interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint (which is usually a complaint in addition to a final order or decision) and the presence of power in the labour relations board to make final order in respect of the application. The power claimed for the Labour relations Board to make interim orders in respectof proceedings before arbitration boards is inconsistent with that exclusivity even if used only to aid arbitration boards by supplying power that the the arbitral board itself may not have. Nor is there anything in s. 25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the Labour- Relations Board in the arbitration process."

At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence.

A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The applicants recognized that if the plaintiff was found to be incompetent and the action was discontinued, or the defendants were successful in their defence, that they would be at risk of not being able to collect taxable costs against the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application was another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetencies. It would be inappropriate for the Court to order a single examination for determination of an issue where it would be unwise to act on a single recommendation.

c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children, who had recently passed away, alleged that the accused had given him money to buy cattle. The other son of the accused, who lived on the farm with his grandmother, was also in opposition to the accused. HELD: The accused was convicted of uttering the threat. The Court held that since the accused was a professional and experienced criminal and that his prior convictions were irrelevant, there was no point in raising the accused's application as the evidence will have to be put before the trier of fact in order to get ruling on the motion anyway. Although the accused appeared to have a modest net worth, the Court was not left in any doubt as to whether the teen's ability to hear the alleged threats had been affected by the fact that she had already arranged to go bowling with her friend and that he had told her that he was going to blow up the estate and that she would be put in plastic bags.

The due diligence requirement was relaxed in light of the allegation of arson in the respondent's statement of defence. Although the expert evidence was available at trial, counsel failed to competently present the evidence. The fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the trial result respecting the cause of the fire.  2)The appellants were to pay party and party costs plus the respondent's cost of all proceedings in the Court of Appeal including preparation for the appeal taxed on double column V on or before July 15, 2000.

The appellants were ordered to admit new evidence and a new Trial. The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, his counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants.

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested that her costs be taxed or taxed. 2) Expert medical evidence was of marginal value to the defendant. More was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to file medical reports. The costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 3) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file a medical practitioners' report without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. Questions as to what effect pain disorder had on the plaintiff and when that pain disorder first occurred were major matters. 4) Costs usually go to the successful party. The expert medical witness expenses shall be examined separately.
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court applied the principles in McKenzie to the evidence of credibility, while not necessarily believing the accused am left in reasonable doubt by it, as such the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged. The accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The accused brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. He also sought an order pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under the provisions of the Act, and particulars of the convictions. Crown counsel did not oppose the application for the change. HELD: 1) The accused has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial.  2) The Court reviewed the evidence and found that pre-trial publicity is not alone sufficient to suggest that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had. 3) The evidence showed that a reasonably serene environment is still possible in Saskatoon despite the fact that media reports and other media reports may have referenced the victim and/or the incident giving rise to this trial. However, the majority of media reports are over year old. There is no evidence that the media reports have created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The more recent reports are generally factual references to the progress of the case, including the results of various hearings. In the circumstances, the Court was satisfied that reasonably calm environment is possible here."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted and to identify documents which they object to produce by reason of claim of privilege. HELD: The first order is for the defendant to provide the plaintiff with responses to undertakes made by the third parties within 30 days. The second order seeks additional information regarding third party claims to M&P tax credits. The third parties are obligated to provide any information they have as to the nature of the undertakings and their purpose and purpose. The plaintiff seeks judgment for the amount paid. The broad relevance test applies to all documents and documents relating to discovery. If the defendant as set forth in those responses changes, the plaintiff shall inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days.  1) The discovery process is a complex and time consuming process and the discovery process can take many years to complete. 2) There are a number of requirements on a third party to disclose, including the names of the parties, the dates of undertakings, the number of times they have taken place and the time they have been made. 3) The parties have clearly agreed that undertakings must be made in respect of the amount of PST paid to the third party and that they will provide full and complete responses. 4) The third party claim is not liable for any of the expenses incurred by the parties in preparing the statement of defence. 5) The plaintiff is not obligated to disclose any of these undertakings prior to the completion of examination for discovery of its proper officer. The parties agreed that if the plaintiff revises the position set forth therein, it may file the questions and objections with the local registrar in whose office the proceedings are pending. 6) The portions of the affidavit filed by the plaintiff are of particular interest to the plaintiff as they relate to the taxation of tangible personal property. 7) In respect of tax credits, the paragraphs listing the tax credits together with specific references refer to the value of the cement used in the preparation of the contracts. The paragraphs listing tax credits are ambiguous. 8) An additional paragraph of an undertaking listed in the plaintiff's possession or control refers to tax credits for the distinct sale of both services, and as such, the true and full intention of the defendants in entering into the contracts is not contained exclusively in the terms and conditions of those contracts. Both of these documents have clearly identified the references"
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The parties were married in 1976 and ceased living together around the end of 2001. After the separation, the child continued to live with his mother. The mother, who had an income of $78,000 at the time of the separation requested retroactivity of child maintenance for the period 2001 to 2007. The father applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act (MCA) and received a consent order which dealt with most of the issues but gave retroactivity to the date of their separation (see: January 2009). The mother also sought a retroactive award for child support payable by the father pursuant to SCC 37 (dismissal of assets under $1,000). The father resisted the mother's requests to increase child maintenance but, on numerous occasions, increased his monthly payment. The parties' income had increased since the separation and the father had made overtures to the mother for increased child maintenance. He had refused to provide any additional amount and the mother now applied for retroactive order beyond the three-year limitation period. HELD: The father's request for retroactivity was denied. The court held that the mother had 'effective notice' that child support was being paid and that she had not been encouraged to increase her monthly payment by the mother. Therefore, the father was required to pay retroactive child support from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. It was not appropriate to make the retroactivity award retroactive to the time the father delayed in seeking an award. The Court found that the father's dramatic increase in salary was sufficient notice that his child maintenance obligation had to be increased and that his failure to provide income in accordance with the Guidelines should be corrected from the date the separation. As the father has not made any effort to improve his living situation, the burden of this burden lies with the mother who must take steps to remedy the situation."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for forfeiture of the vehicle. The Director’s application was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the grounds that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The applicant and the respondent are common-law spouses. The director purchased the vehicle in 2010 with money received from her father’ll. Beginning in January 2013, the accused entered the vehicle near a fenced compound and entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. He pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 80 hours of community service. Both charges were ultimately withdrawn but the applicant and respondent indicated that they were dependent on the vehicle to earn their living. Application dismissed; there was no evidence the judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, remove the profit from crime and the need for compensate victims; nor did he fail to take into account the fact that the Vehicle had been held by the Director for 90 days."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s. 23 of the Act and s. 37(1)(b) of The Act granting them custody and an order for an ordered amounting to $5,000. HELD: 1)Each child was in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b)of the Act. 2)As the first option, that of returning the children to their parent, is unavailable, the question is whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The Agency was able to make the orders requested. 3)The children were designated as person of sufficient Interest pursuant to ss. 23(3), pursuant to S.23(4) and pursuant to (5)of that order. The information contained in the Agreed Statement of Allegations and Admissions was available at the protection hearing and was used to describe the agency's revised plan. 4)Each was to have access to the Agency's files, the history of the children's lives and the added stability of the order being sought."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s decision was imminent. The court ordered a shared parenting regime and ordered that the child’S primary residence be in Moose Jaw or Regina. The respondent’d parents were divorced in November 2012. During his youth, the respondent moved about Saskatchewan with his parents, brothers and sister. He worked part-time for their church. The petitioner lived on social assistance for four years. During this time, the petitioner often visited her parents and their two children. The child was normal and resilient in coping with her parents’ conflict and conflict. The Court found that the respondent was a competent and loving parent. The mother was also highly critical of the respondent”s parenting skills and the child was prone to temper tantrums."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.",HELD: The application was granted. The court found that: 1) a claim was made against the defendants based on the plaintiff's policy; 2) that the defendants conspired and combined amongst themselves to defraud and to injure the plaintiffs in order to delay or defeat the plaintiffs' obvious and substantial crop loss because of chemical spray drift; and 3) that each defendant had a policy of insurance with SMI that did not cover the type of loss sustained by the plaintiffs and therefore did not seek coverage or indemnification from SMI on their policy of Insurance; and 4) that there was no evidence that the plaintiff had a duty of good faith towards the defendants other than that of a duty to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiff in prosecution of the claim.
c_2018skqb29.txt,HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT: The applicant/petitioner applies for a variation of an interim order issued by the Court in August 2007. The order was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agree that they have reasonable arrangements for the support of the child pursuant to s. 15.1(8) of the Divorce Act. The applicant seeks an order from the Court terminating his obligations for payment and that the respondent will reapply for child support and spousal support. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The applicant has not met the threshold obligation to satisfy the Court that there is a material change in circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payor’s obligation to pay child support. 2) The marriage was an 11 year marriage and the applicant was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. He was, when the order was made and now continues to be, a Canadian soldier. The respondent continues to have no income and continues to assert she is disabled and unable to engage in employment. Spousal and child support payments are reviewed by the Department of Defence and are reviewed annually. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the parties and concluded that voluntary early retirement or the choice of a payer to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs for lesser pay do not constitute a material or material change of circumstance sufficient enough to support variation application being made if an agreement was not reached.  3) The respondent is prepared to fully support the applicant once her CPP claim is ruled upon. She is also prepared to apply for and obtain a split of the applicant”s CPP credits. If she is successful and receives a disability pension, that increase in the respondent”ll be combined with the reduction of her income upon retirement. 4) The parties agreed to inextricably intertwine the payor and child financial and medical support obligations to the total “lump sum” payment of $1,400 for tax purposes favouring a large sum payable for spousals and lesser sum than that which would be required for a child support application. The changed circumstances argued for are at best future contingencies not present changes. If future consent orders are reached, the parties should reconsider the advisability of doing so."

The Court of Appeal cannot and should not set asidea conviction merely because it would have taken a different view of the evidence than did the trial Judge. 2)Even if one could find merit in the appellant's argument, which was not accepted and was not reasonable, the court could reasonably convict on other evidence it considered. 3)The trial judge observed that a sober person might refuse to exit his vehicle without his boots, never mind any request to put them on. The trial judge did not raise the possibility of a violation of the Charter. 4)The appellant was prejudiced in making full answer and defence by not knowing someone other than the investigating officer thought he was inebriated the night in question."
d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.",The respondent applied to vary the terms of the consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody of their daughter and the alternative was that the respondent sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The parties separated in October 1994 and the daughter had been in the care of their mother since that time. The daughter had always been the primary care giver and the respondent had always exercised her access rights on a regular basis.HELD: The application was granted. 1)The child had a close relationship with both parents and the Court was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community she had grown up in. 2)The respondent was a good mother and there was nothing to dispute the relationship between the child and her parents. 3)The applicant was not seeking custody pending trial. 4)The court was able to take a few weeks to process the application. 5)The petitioner was not entitled to any variation in access. 6)The Court was unable to say whether the request for interim relief should proceed or whether it should be permitted.

The matter was remitted to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to the finding that the closure of the vacuum division is not a 'technological change' within the meaning of s43(1)(c) of the Trade Union Act. 1)The Board made a patently unreasonable error. The issue had been settled by the decision in Regina Exhibition. Although this decision was now before the Court of Appeal the Court was bound by it. 2)It was not appropriate at this stage to deal with the application for an injunction.  3)The applicants were awarded one set of costs against the respondents.,"The applicants applied for an order of certiorari to quash a portion of an order dated January 5, 1998, which found that the applicants engaged in an unfair labour practice within the meaning of s.43 of the Trade Union Act by failing to provide the Union and Minister of Labour with notice of technological change.

The matter was remitted back to the Labour Relations Board to be dealt with having regard to its finding that the closure of the vacuum truck division was not a 'technological change' within the Meaning of s43(1)(c) of the trade union.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Court was satisfied that the judicial authorities then applicable in Saskatchewan were accepted. 2)The delay was not caused by any prejudice to the accused's reputation or any other prejudice. The minor prejudice suffered by the accused in the absence of counsel was not sufficient to outweigh society's interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. 3)The accused was on bail since shortly after his arrest.

Dismissing the appeal with costs, that where the party that was not properly served expressly waived its right to notice as required by statute, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.","The Director of Assessment appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. The board held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act. The Director took the position that the Board did not have jurisdiction to listen to the appeal because it had not served notice of the appeal on the municipality clerk. In his affidavit he attached to his affidavit a letter in which he disagreed with any attempt to deny the hearing before the Board, and took the positions that the municipality was sufficiently notified by the Board through its clerk. Dismissing the appeal, that the requirements for service contained in s. 63(6) do not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear a appeal from the Assessment Review Court. Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s.(63(3) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions. When such waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions of service do not constitute a bar to the Board's hearing the appeal."

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","The grievor was a hotel employee who had been employed for ten years as front desk manager for the Delta Sydney hotel. She filed a grievance alleging that her work hours were reduced because another employee with greater departmental seniority returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that the hotel management had not committed an error in the manner in which she interpreted the wording of Article 9:01. Rather, she had chosen to use hotel seniority as the basis for her interpretation of the clause. The arbitration judge found that this was not a lay-off situation, but rather a situation where an indefinite reduction of hours had occurred, not by reason of the plaintiff's return from maternity Leave, but by scheduling surrounding the hotel's slow season. The plaintiff was entitled to preference for hours of work over those of the defendant and, in the event that an indefinite number of hours were lost, she would be the one to be penalized for her return. The hotel retained legal counsel who essentially argued that there were two linguistically possible interpretations between which the arbitrator could choose in interpreting the Article9:01 for the purposes of restoring or maximizing hours, precluding overtime. The latter provision was of no consequence here because there was never an attempt by the plaintiff to invoke it."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer. The accused had not been informed of his right to counsel until after the demand had been made, and had not succeeded in obtaining a breath sample. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)It is not the accused's responsibility to provide a sample as soon as is practicable. The Court found that the officer did not communicate the contents of the message on the answering machine to the accused thus failing to establish a reasonable excuse. 2)The accused's conduct was misleading. The admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The court found that even though the accused was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. 3)The Court found it did not believe the evidence on this point. The intoxilyzer did not register because he wasnot blowing properly into the mouthpiece."

The application was allowed and the access order was varied to permit the respondent to restrict access to supervised visits in Manitoba. 1)The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, a child that has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor is the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. 2)The August 15, 2002 order of Koch J. was vacated.

The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother was a convicted child abuser whose name appears on the Child Abuse Register. She had been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of a conviction for child abuse and had been unable to parent her own son. The father, V.M., who was a pediatrician, lived with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area and had recently been placed in the permanent care and custody of the Agency. The paternal grandmother, who was living with her maternal grandmother, had been in regular contact with the child since apprehension. She indicated that if there was a problem with her caring for the child, she would go to the mother's sister, who also had an unsupervised situation. The mother, who lived with her grandmother for several years, indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. HELD: The mother's application for custody was dismissed. The court found that there was no evidence of a bond between the mother and the child and that the child was in need of protection. The evidence showed that the mother was more connected to the child than the maternal grandmother who was asking for care and control of the child. Although number of her children have been in conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. The child was placed in a permanent care or custody of R.S. V. M.

At pretrial conference it became clear that there was an application by the plaintiff to add or substitute another plaintiff and to seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act.

The plaintiff had not sought or received any legal advice during this time as she had not responded to requests for advice respecting the causeof action. The delay was also a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been.

Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was found to be a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied for a remand for assessment pursuant to section 752.1 of the Code, as it was of the view that there had not been adequate consideration of the evidence concerning attempts made to control the offender’s behaviour in the community and the expert who testified on the basis that the accused had been a long-term offender. The Court reviewed the history of the accused and found that he should be designated a long term offender. HELD: The Court found that on an application to have an offender declared dangerous offender, the Court may, on application made under s.753.1(1), find the offender to be an intermediate or long- term offender, even if he met the criteria of a Dangerous offender. There must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability. This is especially true in borderline cases, where the offender may not have been a threat to other persons but is reasonably open to eventual control. The court reviewed R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), and J.L.A.G. (2003 BCCA 66), which dealt with the issue of whether there was a reasonable possibility of control in a community of the risk of the offender re-offending, and how long it would take for an offender to have that control."

The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner father sole custody of his 7 year old daughter, while each of her mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody with the father. The Court found that the mother and grandmother had chosen to relocate from the City of Calgary to Alberta in order to have their daughter go to school there. The petitioner also stated that she was uncertain where her daughter might reside or go to School if she moved with her father to the City. The respondent mother and her mother both testified that they had recently moved from Nova Scotia to Alberta and that their current situation was becoming more civil. The child’s mother and father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future and that she hoped to have her child live with her in Alberta so that she could receive specialized treatment for her daughter. HELD: 1) The petitioner father was awarded independent access. The mother and the maternal grandmother did not have joint custody of the child. 2) The child was to be the primary caregiver for the child for the duration of her life. There was no evidence that the petitioner would seek the assistance of the Nova Scotia courts in the meantime. The court found that both the petitioner mother and his father were incapable of parenting a child of the magnitude 7.5 years of age. 3) The Court was unable to find any evidence as to how the child would fare if the child was removed from the province without the written consent of the mother or an order of court of competent jurisdiction. 4) The respondent father was to have his family move to Alberta by the end of this year. The children would live with their father. 5) The mother was to work seven days a week for four years until she was required to move. She was to reside in an apartment in Alberta until the child graduated from high school. She would move with the child to Alberta when she was ready to go to college. The father would then move with his daughter to Alberta so she could have a better living situation. She and her father had discussed the possibility of moving with their daughter to live with him in Alberta but had not made any arrangements for that purpose. The parties were unable to come to an agreement as to where the child”d be residing or going to school in Alberta."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. The court was satisfied that special circumstances existed permitting further examination and/or questioning of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not required to respond to written interrogatories but was required to provide full and complete responses to all questions and answers as well as an order directing the plaintiff to provide the plaintiff with the name of the surgeon who had performed the surgery on her.  It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that the plaintiff has not had a cause of action for either of those forms of damage. It is the position of the plaintiffs that they require particulars of reviews and inquiries in order to determine the level of skill of the defendant in performing laparoscopic gynecological surgery. The plaintiffs do not have that right. In addition to claim for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, the plaintiff claims aggravated damages and punitive damages."
d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.","HELD: The application was dismissed.

d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The parties never lived together. The respondent went on maternity leave from her position at the Calder Centre in Saskatoon. She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the twins were born. The petitioner was to have access to the children 12 days per month. The parenting judgment provided for an increase in the petitioner's income on equal parenting with the order that the petitioner provide her three previous years tax returns and notices of assessment. The court was to then apply the parenting judgment to the petitioner for a change in the amount of $762 per month paid in ongoing years. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to either of the parties' approaches to the parenting. It is common ground that the respondent has the onus to establish that the three initial conditions have been met. However, there has been no change in circumstances concerning either of them.  2)The petitioner has not satisfied the court that there has a material issue of circumstance. The original judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. The new judgment provided that when an equal parenting arrangement occurred, the petitioner would continue to provide basic Guidelines maintenance as he currently does, with no deduction based on increased parenting time."

The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings.

The landlord's ground of appeal is that the hearing officer was wrong in her decision on the facts. In essence, the landlord asserts the Hearing officer did not find the facts as he suggested that he should have.

This function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal.

d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons.

The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the young persons and ramifications to others. HELD: The affidavit of the plaintiffs is sealed. It is of particular concern that if the evidence of the children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the Students and their Families at further risk. The remainder of the affidavit need not be sealed. The sealing order is at the very top of a hierarchy of protections the court could afford to individual members of our society. The public, including fellow students of the young people, have the right to know their version of the facts.

d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, the accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, who advised him that the officer had not made forthwith an ASD demand and that he was not afforded the right to consult counsel before the demand was made. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The Court found that the accused was not given an opportunity to consider the various grounds for seeking an ASD. The Certificate of Analyses would not be excluded under s. 24(2) ofthe Charter. The Act is intended to provide a reasonable opportunity for the accused to seek counsel. However, it must be considered in light of the accused's egregious driving and the fact that he endangered himself and others by making the demand. In the circumstances, the delay of 11 minutes was largely due to the unavailability of the ASD."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The Court submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. The accused testified that he met a woman along the way who he recognized as a certain type of sword and where it might be available for purchase. Under cross-examination by the Crown, the witness gave further evidence about this particular sword, which he was aware was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not have specific reason for buying the sword, but he did have a reasonable doubt that it was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly placed the accused's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address.  2) The Court accepts that the accused probably bought the sword as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. On this basis, the learned judge concluded that she had a reasonable doubts that the blade was designed as a used weapon."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the VA and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions to proceed to Step 2 of the verification process. The Administrative Judge has determined that there is a need for one comprehensive database for the verification of MLG's claims. The applicant seeks to have the court's auditors (the Federal Representative) refer to as the 'live data' in the applicant's billing program. The respondent applies for directions on this issue. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The application is not allowed. The administrative judge did not err by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI without sufficient information and without due process. He did so on his own motion without notice and either without evidence or properly before him. He made a suggestion as to how MLG should deal with the matter.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendant, who was new to Canada and reliant upon the plaintiff for their employment and housing, had filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. The issue of damages is whether the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date determined by the parties and the Court. HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment for Lilia. 2) There is actually no loan given to Lilia as far as she worked 8 days and never received the cheque for her hours or vacation pay. It is not known at this time what the amount of damages Lilia might have incurred if she had now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. If she is unable to obtain the payments that she has lost, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. 3) The $5k,000 was a loan, as there's no loan documentation prepared and/or signed, which one would anticipate considering a plaintiff is a corporation. Lilia claims the $2,000, which was paid for wages, was never given to her. 4) The defendant claims $1 million for wages. The $2 million, which is claimed as wages and equal gift to the wife, is not proven. The statements of claim filed as exhibits do not show the money was actually paid back. The plaintiff filed the wrong records as to wages and vacation pay and there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque.  5) Lilia is not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the $5K,000 is a loan as there are no loan documents prepared andor signed. There is no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by Lilia and there if no evidence exists to show that the plaintiff had any obligation to record accurate working hours in the record of employment for her.  6) As the amount in the defendant's claim was not known, and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she worked 604 hours, there may be no damages incurred by the defendant in her new position with the service Canada.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine. He had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to comply with a previous order to not attend a youth court meeting despite his being in the province. The accused had sold cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250. The court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Court placed the accused on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts, ordering him to stay out of the Province for two years and ordering him not to sell drugs in the Province. The Crown did not want the accused coming back to La Ronge, Saskatchewan, and to sell narcotics to the youth. The youth was only 1 month into a probation order when he was found with one package of cocaine on his person, he also had $660 cash. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a 6month deferred custody order. 1)The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was financial gain. The most aggravating factor in this case was the fact that the accused had been only one month into his probation order after having been convicted of possessing cocaine for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine. Although the accused may not have had a criminal record, his previous sentence of probation based on a conviction of possession of the same offence for the same purposes had failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society. 2)The aggravating factors were the degree of participation by the accused in the commission of the offence, the very existence of cocaine and heroin in the trafficking operation, the harm done to victims and the community and the fact he was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in the LaRonge community. The amount of cocaine involved in the cocaine trafficking operation had the potential to move this offence into the exceptional case category. However, the Court found that the Court could not find anything that would place this particular offence within the category of an exceptional case."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. HELD: 1) The mother's move with the children is an interim basis. She has formed a new relationship with the father and he is currently incarcerated. While he has been in jail for a number of months, he has not seen the children for the last few weeks. This is one of handful of cases where an interim decision on mobility is appropriate. 2) The court is of the view that the children's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent and that this be done here. While preserving an access relationship and maximizing contact between the children and both parents are to be fostered in the ordinary course, this situation has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. The court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these children would benefit from the continued incarceration of the father. 3) The move is not for job, nor for any other sort of economic opportunity. But are such economic benefits considered to outweigh the considerations of the formation of a new family? Surely the collective interests of the children should be as important as enhanced career prospects have been in other cases. 4) There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While the mother's new relationship and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives, this is not a tenable position. The Court must embark upon a fresh inquiry as to what is in these children's interests. These cases are fact-intensive and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. 5) It is beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to these children. There is no evidence that she has had close ties to them for the past 2 years. The children cannot remain 'on hold' while the father awaits release for, inter alia, beating the mother of the three children.  6) The father is in jail awaiting release. He will remain in jail until at least December 2013. The parties should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime or other means of electronic audio/visual communication. If the move proceeds, there can be a shift in custody to the other parent. Here, the mother is the only available parent for"

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance. Without acknowledging liability, the insurer paid $400,000 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta by the insurer. The trial judge found the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The policy was never at the insured's risk; the policy was void and the insurer ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues had been raised on appeal. The appellant had no obligation to pay the fire loss as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was not at risk for fire loss. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or Fraser- Brace for causing the fire. In this case the appellant had paid the money with a pre-judgment interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire caused the fire nor that there was an implied contractual relationship between the Province and Guardian and neither Guardian and Hartford nor their respective affiliates were required to contribute. 2)The appellant had failed to show that there had been a wrong impression made by the trial judge as to the nature of the agreement. 3)The appeal on the principal issue ought to be dismissed. There was no admissible evidence that Delta caused the blaze nor that Guardian had any obligation to contribute towards the payment of the loss. 4)The respondent was required by the pre-trial agreement to reimburse the respondent for the prejudgment amount owing."

The Provincial court judge was biased. There was not a scintilla of evidence to suggest either the judge was either biased or that there was an apprehension of bias in the hearing. As to the complaint about disclosure, the accused appeared to indicate that he had received full disclosure with respect to the defamation charge and that his complaint was with respectto an ongoing criminal investigation.

The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.

The trial judge found that the defendants were negligent, but awarded damages equivalent to 5 months notice for the wrongful dismissal and 5 months for wrongful dismissal respectively. The appellant cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to her failure to mitigate her loss. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed the long standing legal right of employers and employees to terminate an employment contract at any time provided there was no express provision to the contrary. If an employer dismisses an employee without good cause, he must give the employee reasonable notice or compensation in lieu of notice.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter transportation by the defendant corporations. The defendants admitted to having requested the helicopter transportation be provided to the plaintiff, but denied that they or any of them were the alter ego of Kyrgyzstan Air and took the position that when it was placed on board the helicopter it was not relevant. The plaintiff alleged that the helicopter transport was inherently dangerous and asked the court to review the documents for which privilege was claimed. The only issue was whether the plaintiff corporation was in a position to determine when such survival gear was placedon board the helicopters. HELD: The plaintiff corporations were obliged to answer questions directed at whether insurance was obtained, if so who arranged and paid for the same, and if so, who arranged the payment of the money. The questions relating to insurance were not specifically dealt with. If not, leave was granted to reapply for direction. The Court found that the theories advanced by the defendants were not logically relevant to the issue of safety and were not relevant to this case. The application for direction was dismissed. It was not possible that the plaintiff's counsel would attempt to introduce the evidence at trial but that a detailed perusal of documents will suggest the possibility of these theories. The court found that there was no evidence before the trial judge as to their relevance."

The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.

The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) This license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public. No advertising of the availability of liquor service was permitted; and 5) The applicant must proceed to obtain a development agreement.  6) It was against that background that the modern regime of land use controls, with their inherent tension between the owner's interest in putting its own property to what it regards as the optimal use and the municipality's interest, has resiled from that position and now states that the present use is a non-conforming use.

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004.

This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights (the Charter) on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. Actions of the Crown were not involved. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that there was no actual or inferred prejudice and that the conditions of release subject to release were not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice. The prejudice to the accused in the delay was not something that he could overcome. The six months delay was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused.

The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff, now 30 years old, joined the action of his own insurer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court found that the plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to the victim and that he retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration for him to show that he was still the owner of the vehicle.

As the plaintiff testified at trial that he had no idea who the person who had given him the van was, but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to report the location and license number. It was not immediately clear what the person that had given the plaintiff the van belonged to. The inconsistencies in the defendant's evidence concerning his admitted poor memory of the events that occurred within the general time frame of late November to late December gave rise to a number of credibility issues.

By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite respecting assets leased by the Bank of Canada.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents (defendants), the defendants, and the Village of Bjorkdale. The appellant contended that Justice Rithery had erred in granting the motion. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The court found no tenable basis to interfere with the decision of Justice Rreamy. 2) The evidence was present at trial and the appellant was an experienced demolition derby participant, assisted by four-man pit crew. He had modified his vehicle to the required standards, to his own satisfaction in relation to its operation and safety, including the safety of an unconventional ignition system he had devised to give him an advantage in starting the vehicle whenever it stalled. 3) The appellant suffered burns of varying degree to various parts of his body. His right hand and arm were badly burned. They were burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle came to stop."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The issues were that the mother failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child. The application also requested an order allowing the father to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. HELD: 1) There had been a material change in the circumstances which existed at the time of the Original Custody Judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for a joint custody arrangement, was possible. As the mother demonstrated that it was not, a review of the order as to custody is justified. 2) The evidence confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. The respondent had been granted sole custody in June 2006 and by this judgment had been allowed to have sole custody. The child was currently enrolled in kindergarten and day care close to her father's apartment in Saskatoon. 3) The custodial parent's reason for moving was not supported by the evidence; the respondent had made no effort to obtain the required information from the Custody Counsel as required by s. 282(1) and s. 283(2) of the Criminal Code concerning the taking of this child out of the Province of Saskatchewan and preventing the father's joint custody and shared parenting on a scheduled schedule. There was no evidence that this change had occurred because the mother was unwilling or unable to provide counsel to the father regarding the custody issue. 4) The respondent was granted joint custody with shared custody with respect to the child, but his application for access was refused by the mother. The Custodial Counsel referred to the cases of Woodhouse v. Woodhouse (1996), 136 D.L.R. (4th) 577 and Rosenau v. Rosenau (2004 SKQB 275) which reviewed the law regarding variation applications and mobility. 5) The Court was satisfied that there had been no material change that existed at time that would result in joint custody. It was not in the child's best interests to move with the father. The Court would lose jurisdiction if the move was approved. The court reviewed the seven factors set out in Gordon v. Goertz and found them to be justified. 6) The father was entitled to a share of the costs."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant was a First Nations faculty member who was involved in the creation and operation of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. He had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina. He was invited to speak at a symposium on post-secondary education policy and funding held in mid-March 2005. The decision was later reversed by the President of the First Nation University. At the Board of Governors meeting in April 2005, the applicant brought a grievance against the respondent, alleging that the respondent had interfered with his academic freedom. The respondent sought to have the decision reversed. He sent a letter to the President in April 2006 asking him if his Board could be asked to intervene and request the symposium's organizing committee reconsider the matter of his presentation. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) Before passing upon the merits of the application it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the board of arbitration. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union, 2004 SCC 23 (CanLII); [2004] S.C.R. 609 the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment of the tribunal, it is clear the standard is one of reasonableness. 2) In the present case, the Board reviewed and then had reference to portions of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Collective Agreement. The Board interpreted these provisions as imposing a positive obligation upon the University and its officers to defend and promote the exercise of academic freedom by faculty members and then went on to consider what happened at the board meeting on April 12. In this respect, we find that the Employer violated the collective agreement, and we uphold the grievance in part. The reasons as a whole support that finding. 3) The respondent failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.",FIAT: The first access issue was for an order that would enable the petitioner to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. The second access issue came before the Court for the second time. The parties were never married and the petitioner was employed as a hotel supervisor. The respondent worked every day for two weeks then one week followed by a week off. HELD: 1) There was no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. The access provisions in the February 2007 fiat were meant only to cover the gap between the application and pre-trial. The request to specify access this summer was not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order. 2) The petitioner was granted access for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August.  It was reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased.  3) Applications to alter interim access orders were not the answer. The matter had not even been set down for pre- trial.
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of the ineffective counsel of the complainant. The matter was remitted for an appeal. The appellant would not testify on his own behalf on the grounds that his non-lawyer agent provided him with ineffective assistance. The grounds of appeal were that the complainant had given evidence that amounted to evidence of shoddy police investigation unrelated to the matter at trial and that the appellants had not been advised of the substance of the charge by the agent who had been hired to represent them. There was no procedural unfairness as a consequence of the appellant's decision to not testify as he did not believe the evidence provided. The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the spouse was made by the appellant with the assistance of his lawyer. The evidence at trial did not establish a miscarriageof justice. The trial judge was in no position to review his reasons to determine if the appellant should have been permitted to testify. The appeal would have been allowed on the basis that the fresh evidence did not have any effect on the outcome of the trial.
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.",The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and knowing or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry and asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call. Defence Counsel advised that they had one witness they wished to call but that he was not available to testify. Defence counsel granted an adjournment to allow Defence Counsel time to make arrangements to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness for the Defence in the Preliminary Inquiry.
e_2011skqb30.txt,"The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support. HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","A review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010. HELD: 1) The court was not persuaded on this review that it was in the best interests of the children to change the interim access order made in August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it. Those questions are best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility can be considered and adjudicated. The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were also adjourned for review by the pre-trial conference. 2) Considering the existing means and needs of the parties, the court declined to order interim spOUSAL support since it was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. However, the respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. 3) Considering all the existing needs of both parties, I declined to award interim spielal support since I am not satisfied the respondent has the existing Ability to Pay it. The parenting issue should be adjourned pending reporting by the children's psychologist."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was that an in-court identification was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through the Appearance Notice. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition is admissible. Although there was no identification in court, the accused was provided with a copy of a letter from SGI showing the accused's name and date of birth. The letter was marked as Exhibit P-1 for identification. 2) The accused admitted that he knew that he was prohibited from driving. The Crown argued that this constitutes prima facie proof of identity and there was therefore no basis from which the Court could conclude that a s 259 offence had been committed as opposed to a violation of the Traffic Safety Act. The Court was referred to authorities who examined driver records, obtained a photograph of the accused and set a date for trial. 3) The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the letter was the same person who had stood trial."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court held that the exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at the initial voir dire as there had not been any evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. The issue of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter right occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017 and the issue of exclusion of Evidence pursuant to 24(3) was still not determined. The trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The determination of their ultimate admissibility was to await completion of argument on s.24(2)."
