2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch Keanna every second day' and that after that the respondent had access to every second weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. The respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the mother. HELD: The child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the husband. The petitioner has and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support the conclusion that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable.  1) The purpose of an interim custody order is to give person the right and duty to care for child until a permanent order or another interim order is made. On an interim application, the focus differs from that of a permanent custody hearing. Rather than focussing on the long-term best interests of a child, court tends to focus on the short-term needs of the children. As a result, interim orders usually reinforce the status quo in an attempt to reflect on the best interests and the child will likely be affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties. 2) The petitioner is entitled to reasonable access."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers, seeking a declaration that there were were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. The Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. They applied for costs on a solicitor client basis. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the New Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of the expenses of the litigation. As in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. The Bowsers suggest $12,000 plus disbursements, whereas the Sheas suggest $5500. Both parties file an Affidavit of Contest and submit hard copies of it. The applicants faxed the Notice of Contest on September 14, 2011 and then filed hard copies on October 5, 2011. Those were subsequently rejected by court staff and were re-filed. The Court found that the total cost to the respondents in the amount of $6000 was $302.75. The court allowed the application for a multiplier of two to bring the total costs to $1,000. It is not one of those rare cases where solicitor client costs should be awarded. Party and Party Costs The Court awarded $2,000 to the applicants for the cost of preparing the affidavit and then applying the multiplier to the total number of applications. The amount of money consumed in chambers is not an issue in this case."

The theft of a computer and modem exceeding $1,000 in value contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code and mischief by damaging a motor vehicle and damaging the vehicle to gain entry into it, and from which he stole the computer and a modem. 12 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. At issue was whether the sentence should be increased or reduced. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The sentence imposed was unfair. 2)The trial judge was correct in his remarks that general deterrence must be a matter of primary concern. 3)The appellant could not be described as a youthful first offender. His record of criminal convictions began in 1980 and included 19 times theft and property related offences."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was struck in the arm by the defendant's right hand as he walked down the driveway towards the property. The defendant had a shovel in his hand and the accused had a knife. The knife was not in the accused's hand as the defendant had pulled it out of his pants. The altercation continued and the defendant suffered fractures to his elbow and rib cage as result of the assault. The accused and the victim both suffered from fractures to their upper arm. The defence evidence established a prima facie case inasmuch as that evidence establishes that the defendant intentionally struck the victim and thereby granted him his right to enter a premises for the purpose of preventing a trespass. The Court found that the accused, by driving in anger to the complainant's property and entering thereon despite being told not to enter upon the property, placed himself in the role of an aggressor and thereby justified in using no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. Although the accused denied having either a knife or a weapon, the defence evidence showed that he had a stick or a butcher knife."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased car arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed SGI's assistance to repair the damage to the car and sought reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer took the vehicle to a repair shop which was to be operated by Crestview and received an appraisal. The repair shop did not provide the plaintiff with the information it needed to determine the extent of the damage or the cost of reinstatement. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)An election to repair is an exercise in force pursuant to s. 39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. An express election is not necessary. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election to reinstate. 2)The definition of an election has received its own treatment. A reasonable insurer would not elect to reinist unless it had all the information and materials necessary to choose the most advantageous course of action. In the case of this case, Crestview was not entitled to that information. 3)An express election does not constitute an election. An election under the Act to repair involves the insurer making a payment to the repair shop for the repair. The actual cash value of the vehicle is not to exceed the cost to repair or replace the exhaust system as fixed by regulations. 4)If an insurer elects to repair, it must give the assured unequivocal notice that it intends to do so. 5)The claim is dismissed. 6)Costs are awarded to the lessee of vehicle registered to Crestview."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitions for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently seek joint custody with the father. Hayley's mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) Hayley is seven years old. Since the commencement of these proceedings, each party and their extended families have chosen to relocate from the City of Moose Jaw. The Court has no other facts before it relating to the physical aspect of where Hayley might reside or go to school if she moves with her father to the city of Calgary.  2) The mother testified that she and her father had agreed that she would be the homemaker for the foreseeable future. It is clear that she is uncertain where she and the father may be residing in the future. 3) The father is currently residing in an apartment in Alberta with his father. His current residence is two and one-half blocks from the nearest school. During the course of their relationship, the mother would often telephone the police, the RCMP, the Alberta Police Service, the Department of Community Resources and Employment (DCRE) and the Alberta Health Services. The father currently works seven days a week. During this time, he has been living in the apartment with his mother and attending classes at SIAST. The mother has recently moved from Moose Jaw to Alberta. She is currently working seven days week and plans to move to Calgary in the fall. 4) The parents have agreed that Hayley will be their child's primary caretaker. Their intention is to have the child live with them for the duration of her life so that she can get used to living with her mother. Their current circumstances are complicated by the fact that each party has chosen to move from their Moose Jaw residence to a different city."

The father applied for an order pursuant to the Children's Law Act s.29(1)(a) finding the mother in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of the August 15, 2002 access order. He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent. The father shall bear the costs of access with partial reimbursement in the amount of $60 per month, which may be deducted from ongoing child support. He shall give at least seven days notice if he is unable to exercise access. The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The petitioner father applied for an order pursuant to s. 29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order. She sought to restrict access visits to supervised visits in Manitoba. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, whom the petitioner has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. She continued to be held in contempt when she moved with the child without prior notice to the petitioner. The respondent did not abduct the child. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with terms of the order. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The petitioner was not abducted. A fine was not called for in the circumstances."
7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support. HELD: 1)The matrimonial property was valued and divided equally. The wife was permitted to register a caveat to protect the value of her 1/2 interest. If the husband did not arrange payment by September 1st next, the wife was given leave to apply for a sale. 2)The wife was given custody of the 2 children of the marriage.  The court ordered specific access for the husband. 3)The court confirmed the interim support orders made before trial in the amounts of $400.00 per month for the wife, $400.00 per month for the oldest child, and $800.00 per month for the youngest child, who was handicapped.","The issues were custody and access, child and spousal support and division of the matrimonial property. The respondent granted interim maintenance in the amount of $400 per month for the couple's two children; $800 for the respondent and $400 for the children. An application by the respondent to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J.on May 11, 1993. However, the parties agreed that a kind of specified access should be put in place. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the petitioner must be rejected. The farm home is 22 miles from the respondent's residence. The property is divided. The parties agree that the value of the farm property is $50,711.66 and that it was purchased in 1985 for $55,000. One half of that amount may be transferred to a prescribed R.R.S.P. for Mrs. Heshka. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay the petitioner for her support at $400 and $800 per month and as well as $400 in monthly installments. The amount payable to the petitioner does not include the share of Terrance's share of the pension benefit in $3,887. The Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Plan shall transfer the sum of $30,000 to an RRSP as may be prescribed by Jeanette. 2)The petitioner was not seeking custody of the children but required firm guidelines as to access. Upon hearing the parties' differing opinions as to whether or not Terrance should continue making the support payments, it was agreed that he would not be able to continue without an award. 3)An award for a retroactive award was rejected. There was discussion at the trial as to how it should be determined. 4)Terrance had from this date a beneficial interest created by this order, sufficient to support the registration of a caveat in the following lands. The petitioner was awarded costs on the petition and counter-petition."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content and refused to pay the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to full payment of the contractual price.  1) The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. The quality requirements of the contract had been met. 2) There was nothing in the contract with the farmer in which he was to continue to accept risk of non-acceptance or non-payment from any third party. He was an interested party in the whole transaction and no evidence was led that he had sufficient skill with respect to knowledge and use of the German language to allow proper interpretation of the documents. 3) The documents submitted by Bio Canada were not admitted into evidence.  4) The issue of whether the plaintiff fulfilled his contractual obligations to the company and thus entitled to a full payment or pre-judgment interest was of little relevance in the final conclusion.  5) The plaintiff had judgment against the defendant in the sum of $51,608. The plaintiff has claimed pre-jgment interest. There is no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of all of the sum owing to Wlwich. He is entitled to that amount taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I(B) of the Tariff of Costs."

The defendant entered the house in the night and assaulted the complainant when she returned to pick up some clothes. Imposing a sentence of two years eight months, plus a ten year firearm prohibition, that this offence could be categorized as a major sexual assault. The principles of sentencing and the impact on the victim, especially in view of the fact that she was his common-law spouse, made this sentence fit.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting his common-law spouse. The offence was contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. A jury had found the accused guilty of sexual assault on the wife, whom they had separated days prior. The accused had previously entered the home of a stranger and raped her, despite her struggles to get out of it. She had recently filed a victim impact statement and indicated that she did not wish to return to her father's home. HELD: A fit and proper sentence for the crime, taking into account the circumstances of the offence and the requirements of denunciation and deterrence, was a period of incarceration of 2 years and 8 months, the total being 30 months. Under s.100(1), the criminal Code, the accused was prohibited from possessing or possessing firearms for 10 years.  1)With regard to the sentencing issue, consider that this was not a stolen romantic moment with hesitant partner, but a violent assaultive act, the effects of which will stay with the victim for years and the sad example for your daughter. 2)Given the high profile of the accused's family and the fact that he had a child, the court decided to impose a victim fine surcharge."
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant seeks leave to appeal an order by the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The parties are disputing MLG's obligations under the CAP and each has made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions for directions. The appellant argues the CAP was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The Administrative Judge made no error in requiring the applicant to supply the redacted electronic billing records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. Any allegations of delay by the appellant are simply unfounded and in applying the test for the granting of leave, the Court of Appeal will look at the reasons for the impugned order. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The order appealed from was simply a determination of the CAP process procedural in nature and each of the grounds of MLG is bound to fail. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. MLG has failed to establish that there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, to the field of practice or the state of law, or to the administration of justice generally to warrant a determination by the Court. MLG's appeal will be allowed in its usual fashion and the leave application will have its costs in the usual manner."

Allowing the appeal in part, that the Chambers judge erred when he concluded that all questions of law, including questions where the law is clear, should not be brought before the court in an application to strike, when he concluded that the constitutional question posed by the respondent had not yet been answered by the courts, and when he determined that the extent of the immunity of the appellant Board and its members, except for the Chair, was unclear.

The appellant states that the actions of the Board and of the personal defendants who participated in the decisions leading to these actions were an attempt to stonewall the plaintiff from uncovering and making public that the principal of the plaintiff and that he was alleged to have an anti-union attitude. The appellants subsequently brought an application for certiorari to the Supreme Court to quash the Board's orders and its decision to refuse leave to apply for reconsideration. The Chambers judge dismissed the application for leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the issue of Crown immunity as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, was not a matter of multifarious proceedings, at least not to the extent of being frivolous and vexatious, and all appear to be sincerely designed to seek redress of alleged wrongs."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with knowingly uttering a threat to cause death to his three children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The accused had lived on a farm for 64 years and had a very bitter family fight. One of the children had recently passed away and the family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to the estate. When the accused dropped in to visit his grandmother, the grandmother, who was preparing to go bowling with her friend, heard the accused say that he would blow up the farm and its occupants (who were in immediate temporal proximity) in order to make them 'kill' and 'blow them up'. The defence objected, arguing that the convictions were dated and highly prejudicial. The Court allowed the application based on s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act and the case law. HELD: 1) It is always open to the accused to make a Corbett application and have ruling on it before electing to call evidence. In practice, it seems as if criminal records are tendered as a matter of course in non-jury trials with the assumption that a trial judge can properly ignore the prejudicial effects of the record. While none of the prior convictions should be disregarded insofar as they relate to the Accused's credibility, there was no delay in calling the police and giving statements. 2) The accused admitted that he lost it during the conversation. The common meaning of which is to completely lose control of one's emotions, actions or speech and act in an irrational, unpredictable and possibly violent manner. 3) The Court was not left in any doubt as to whether the accused took the words of the accused seriously. There would be little point in raising the application as the evidence will have to be put before the trier of fact in order for the motion anyway."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of s197 of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village.  They claimed the bylaws of the resort Village were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter. HELD: The charges were dismissed. 1) The municipality did not deny the existence of a boathouse on a public reserve. 2) It did not seek permission from anyone. 3) The Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 4) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the province had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in law, to public reserves. 5) In some cases, however, cottage lots did go to the high water mark. 6) However, in some cases cottage lots do not go to that level. 7) In others, old cottage lots exist immediately beside newer ones which are behind public reserve which, as far as the appearances of the matter are concerned, are part of the private lot. 8) There are access walkways to such public reserves, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey. One would not be likely to realize that the public reserve existed, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing. Such a walkway would have to be under the purported authority of the provincial bylaws, which they did not really apply to. 9) In this case, the defendants were the owners of the buildings and land bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, Saskatchewan, Plan 83B16092. In another case, a condo lot existed immediately beside another one which was behind another one. The condo lot at Echo Bay was the subject of a conservation easement. The owner of the cottage lot complained to the municipality in 1989 that his property was being used for deck construction. When the municipality did issue a stop work order, he refused to vacate the property. The plaintiff appealed. The defendant's"
b_1995canlii6134.txt,"The Plaintiff commenced these proceedings seeking to recover damages for personal injuries alleged to have been suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff's condition related to 2 pre-existing injuries. The only issue which the Court was asked to resolve was whether this accident had caused or contributed to the Plaintiff's injuries. HELD: The question posed was answered in the affirmative. While a normal healthy person might not have been injured in this low speed rear-end collision, the Court was satisfied that, because of the Plaintiff's previous injuries and poor sitting position, the collision did contribute to her current condition in a modest manner.","The 46-year-old female plaintiff sought judgment for damages she suffered as a result of the defendant's negligent operation of the motor vehicle owned by Mr. Bird. All of the elements of the plaintiff's claim had been resolved with the exception as to whether her injuries were caused by the defendants negligence. HELD: The Court held that it did not accept the expert's opinion as to causation of the damage. Based on the evidence presented, the court concluded that the defendants' negligence did not have a causal connection. The court found that the cause of the pain was pre-existing injuries and not the collision itself. The expert was not qualified to give an opinion on causation of injury in the lower back because his research appears to be limited to reviewing the McConnell, West and Szabo reports."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the Information To Obtain Search (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 10(b) of the Charter and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege the commission of the offence, or creation of child pornography, but only of invitation to sex. The same issue was raised in R. v. Vu, which dealt with the issue of whether a justice acting judicially could have facilitated the issuance of a search warrant. In this case, the accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude, while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. The search of the computer was conducted immediately and before returning any of the items to the justice, and without further authorization as is now required. The affidavit also failed to differentiate information and belief as it did not refer to the child who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The cumulative effect of these errors was a conclusion that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue in the court's opinion. The above conclusion therefore renders the warrant to Search a nullity, and the search unlawful."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his Father's intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant gave notice of intention to cross-examine on the affidavits. HELD: Garry Mayer has cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of the defendant's negligence. He shall have judgment against the defendant for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity and his costs to be taxed. The claim was also dismissed for excess probate fees paid by the estate. Given that the defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant, no evidence was led against it and the claim against it was dismissed. Although the defendant held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application form could do nothing but cause confusion in the plaintiff's mind. Moreover, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the caution or advice was in fact given and ought reasonably to have been understood by him."
b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, aged 21 and 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The second child, aged 18, decided not to go to university that fall and the respondent ceased paying support for him. HELD: In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for the support of the two children under the age of majority as they are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and had the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school.  1) The Table amount of support for children based upon the respondent's income is $1,153 per month. This amount is not so high as toceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. It is not clearly excessive given the cost of maintaining the home for the children. 2) The evidence at hand was that the children were able to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and had their ability contribute adequately when not attending school. The petitioner's direct food and shelter expenses are $18,000 per annum. The overall household expenditures are greater. 3) The respondent ought to have determined the amount to be payable by the respondent in accordance with the Table amount.  4) Although it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her own support and education, it was not so clear how this is to be applied in an individual circumstance. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and the legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. To increase the extent of the legal obligation of the parents and to rebut the operative presumption that s. 3(2)(a) is rebuttable, having regard for the actual needs of the children and their means of living. The Court was satisfied that the chamber judge misapplied s.3(2) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of subsection 3(1)(b). The Court of Appeal in Wright v. Wright, [1996] held that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether Table amount exceeds that budget, but rather is the Court's role in determining the actual costs of raising children.

d_2010skqb349.txt,"The defendant applied for an order sealing the affidavits of two young people who were the victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted at a high school by senior students, including the plaintiffs. The defendant argued that public disclosure of the affidavits would exacerbate the harm that was done to the young people. The Leader-Post was granted leave to speak to the matter and opposed the application. HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. Counsel for the plaintiffs consent to the order. The defendant applies at the top of the range of protections which the Court may afford to individuals in our society and that the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the young persons and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The Court is concerned that such disclosure would put both the physical and psychological well-being of the Students and their Families at further risk. HELD: 1) The Court refers to Dagenais v.

c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of certified cheque as payment did not satisfy just debt. The defendant in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest. Default judgment was taken out January 13, 1997. In considering an application under Rule 173(a) the court may only look at the notice of motion, the attached statement of claim, and any document which is referred to in the statementof claim upon which the plaintiff must rely for the establishment of the claim. The court must assume that all the allegations in the defendant's statement of claims are true, and so assume, that such allegations are sufficient to disclose a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. Here the defendants gave no consideration for the payment and the claim cannot be defeated."

The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","An appeal from a refusal of certiorari or other relief on review of decision of a disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association.

In finding Ripley guilty on charges (v) of conduct unbecoming a senior officer of an investment dealer and (vi) of breach of a by-law (c) which establishes disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct which is contrary to the rules of natural justice (including bias), the panel found that Ripley was effectively conducting business within business for his personal profit. He defamed his employer by promoting securities which had not been properly vetted by personnel of the company. Ripley could not have corrected decisively and quickly situations of non-compliance, such as Eric Hicks involvement with outside deals, had he not done so."
d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. The court could not conclude that the aggravated and punitive damages would fail as against the remaining defendants. It would be difficult to prove that any of the defendants acted in bad faith, with deliberate or reckless disregard for the plaintiff, Lisa Dawson, or with extreme or malicious behaviour causing additional suffering or deserving of punishment. The jurisprudence in medical malpractice cases does not favour granting aggravated or punitive damages. However, special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. The defendant argued that quality assurance reviews where complications occurred are all subsequent to the events of this case and irrelevant. In any event, the defendant has already been extensively examined relating to his training, experience, techniques and procedures."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The access issue has come before the Court twice. In February, 2007, Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified custody and access. For the period subsequent to that, she ordered that the petitioner have access every weekend, every third weekend, and every fourth weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday at 10:00 a.m., (xiv) for two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each. With good reason. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. The request to specify access this summer is also in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence that there had been a material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. 2) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is not the way to go. 3) The request for specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as a disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within a reasonable time period of time."
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of SMI's policy of insurance. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. HELD: 1) The application to strike the claim against SMI is based on the fact that the plaintiffs policy holders are included in the defendant's coverage. 2) The Court found that a breach of the plaintiff's duty to act fairly and in good faith would require the insurer to breach the duties described above, placing the indemnity insurer in an impossible situation which would not advance the law or the public interest. 3) Each act was done by the person or persons therein alleged on behalf of themselves and their co-conspirators in furtherance of the said conspiracy to defraud. There was no allegation of an increased loss as a result of the claimed."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with breach of s. 8 of the Charter by failing to provide a sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on all of the counts. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct a search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248. The police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The facts were almost identical. The accused had walked to her vehicle carrying a small child and put the child in the car seat in the backseat and drove away. The 7-11 employee went outside the store to obtain the licence plate. Constable Clements and several police officers attended to the home in full view. There was no evidence of driving at all. The officer engaged in a warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to a dwelling house. The officers accompanying the accused around the home and the actions outside of the house in full public view are serious. Therefore the implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit 'convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling'. The refusal to provide samples is also considered. Although the Court found the officer behaviour egregious, it did not find the Charter breach is serious."

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

The panel found that based on the respondent's agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The respondent took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and conclude that on the basis of the respondent grievor's employment record, the final incident justified termination of his employment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1)The standard of judicial review applicable to decisions of a consensual arbitration board is the patently unreasonable test, absent jurisdictional or procedural fairness issues. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The respondent took the position that labour arbitrators are entitled to deference in applying common law principles of interpretation to the provisions of the collective agreement but not to accept that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. 4)The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months."

August 7, 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The parties agreed that, from and after his mandatory retirement, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute a material change in circumstance prompting yet another variation application at that time. HELD: The application was dismissed. The applicant was directed to immediately proceed to complete the application to split the CPP credits equally, the same to be supported by the respondent once her CPP claim was ruled upon.  1)The respondent recommenced his military career in early 2000 and served in the military at the time he authorized the Order he now seeks to vary. This is based upon Ms. Ellis-Reid's failure to obtain employment of any significance since the Order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order.  2)The applicant had no income and she suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continued to assert she was disabled and unable to engage in employment.

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years. The possibility of a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act was ruled so remote as to be frivolous.","The vendors and their predecessors in title, namely the Bentleys and the Bentley, by open, open, and continuous possession since 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. This title has been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years. The only person able to pinpoint the location of the missing frontage was the respondent's daughter. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The evidence submitted by the purchasers was so remote as to be frivolous and as is, therefore, not a valid objection to title. 2)The time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act. 3)Even if found to be true, the evidence of possession by the appellant and her successors in title did not defeat a claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act against whom such possession must be proved for a period of at least 60 years."
d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The accused was convicted of aggravated assault for wounding his sister. The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753(1) of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The defence position was that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now also consider whether the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender is 'dangerous offender' and must be sentenced to indeterminate detention. The Court referred to R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), where the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Johnson was based. Johnson held that in order to achieve the goal of protection of the public under the dangerous offender provisions, one has to be concerned about behaviour exhibiting the degree of violence reflected in the aggravated assaults and, to some extent, set aside the other offences. An application to have an offender declared dangerous offender can succeed without the sentencing judge being placed in a position to properly discharge these responsibilities. The court reviewed the cases that pre-dated the Johnson decision and found that the standard is not whether cure is guaranteed but whether there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control in the community. The following three issues were reviewed: 1) the Court reviewed the history of the accused's offences. It found that most of the offences were the first offences committed, but that the predicate offence was the most serious and involved violence. The accused had three previous convictions, all of which related to domestic violence; 2) an assault on his sister; and 3) other incidents of violent behaviour by the accused that occurred in the context of his daily living activities. The most serious of these offences involved stabbing his sister and he had stomped on the victim's head, stomach and groin area and kicked her when he was lying on the floor gravely injured; 3) various expert witnesses testified concerning the accused’s behaviour in relation to the predicate and predicate offences. In addition to receiving evidence concerning the expert witnesses, the Court considered whether there had been a reasonable prospect of change in the course of the offender”s life, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender and appreciated that the essential question to be considered was whether the risk to re-offend was reasonably open to eventual control."
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","PricewaterhouseCoopers, receiver and manager of Wheatland Industries (1990) Ltd. (the plaintiff) carried on business as a farm equipment dealer at separate locations in Rosetown, Saskatchewan and Elrose, Saskatchewan. Wheatland entered dealership agreements with equipment suppliers, including New Holland Canada (which was part of CNH Canada) and Flexi-Coil Ltd. The dealerships granted the plaintiff lines of credit on the security of present and after-acquired product inventory. At issue was whether the three suppliers were obliged to pay certain amounts to the plaintiff for restocking purposes. HELD: 1)The contractual provisions clearly entitle the plaintiff to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However, ss. 50(2) and (3) serve to override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. 2)The word 'goods' must be interpreted to include 'parts' which in common English language usage would surely be the case. See that as the essential intent of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. 3)The plaintiff was acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the receiver to CNH are to be read and construed as part of the priority agreement. There is no dispute that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the trade. The relationship between the vendors and the plaintiff was one of importance. 4)The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the TD and the CNH companies and to their interpretation of s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act. There may be a similar agreement involving Flexi‑Coil but it has not been provided. 5)The parties object to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the issue has arisen here, this is a collateral matter which has no impact on the outcome, except as to costs. 6)The receiver, as an officer of the Court, has filed a report outlining the background facts in detail. There are no facts in dispute. 7)It is not in dispute that the parties stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. 8)The recitals in issue refer to new goods, used goods and trade-in goods."

In 1997, the plaintiffs first learned through other family members that the defendant, a nephew of the deceased, had revealed to them that it was actually he who was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. They brought an action under the provisions of the Fatal Injuries Act. This was an application to disallow the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant. Dismissing the application without costs, that the limitation as prescribed by the Act is twelve months, which the plaintiffs had clearly exceeded. This time period is without regard to the injured party's knowledge of whether or not a claim exists.","This was an application for an order disallowing the limitation defence raised by Judgment Recovery on behalf of the defendant, Howard LeLacheur, pursuant to s. 10 of the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs were living in Alberta at the time of the 1972 motor vehicle accident and alleged that they had been the driver when the accident took place. The action was commenced 25 years later. At issue was whether the limitation period should begin to run until February 1997, the date upon which they learned for the first time that Howard was the driver of the vehicle 25 years earlier. HELD: The application to disallow the defence was dismissed. The Court declined to award costs to Judgment Recovery. 1)The plaintiff had made no inquiries to the defendant or the police as to how the accident happened. She could have asked him her father's name several times but for some reason did not do so. When time runs from the 'accrual of the cause of action' or from some other event which can be construed as occurring only when the injured party has knowledge of the injuries sustained, the Judge-made discoverability rule may not extend the period the Legislature has prescribed. 2)There was no sufficient evidentiary basis upon which the Court could make a finding of fraudulent concealment on the part of the plaintiff."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT.

c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but then amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children (under s. 23 of the Act and s. 37(1)(b)) and an order granting them custody. Should the amended application be granted? HELD: Each child in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b) is ordered to be placed in the custody of the person of sufficient interest, which effectively means they can return to their parent, placed with a person of adequate interest, in the event circumstances change. The Agency will make the orders requested. Each child is identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved. HELD: 1) The Court has jurisdiction to vary support orders pursuant to the Divorce Act. In L.S. v. E.P., the Court held that the circumstances leading to the child support award had not changed. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend a substantial portion of their time with their mother. 2) Retroactive support is not the same as ongoing support in that the period of time to which it applies has passed and the resources needed for its payment may no longer be available. The Alberta Court of Appeal disagreed with many of the factors on this issue. It adopted the reasoning in Henry v. Henry, 2004 CanLII 34381 (ON C.A.), which held that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive support (i.e. that it is reasonable and consistent with the obligations of child support that payor be required to pay) and that the Court is always free to intervene and determine the appropriate level of support for children."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marihuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter of Rights were violated. This decision follows voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the evidence. HELD: The evidence must be excluded. 1) The accused was unusually nervous. He asserted that he was looking for any additional labels, paint colour changes or information that might confirm or refute the vehicle's true owner and identity. 2) The motor home was extensively modified to facilitate the transportation of illegal drugs. The plumbing and holding tank systems had been disabled, walls had been moved and secret compartments created, and hydraulics with switching system had been installed to provide access to the compartments. The vehicle contained 262 pounds of marijuana (worth between $471,000 and $733,000) in heat sealed plastic bags and two bundles of $3,080 worth of bills were found under a shelf in a cupboard. The RCMP officer observed the accused weaving from one end of the motor home to the other and noticed that the panel from the rear axle to the back had been painted in a flat black. He asked the accused if he was on any medication and when he had last used any liquor or narcotics. The accused stated that he did not wish to contact a lawyer. 3) The evidence was excluded from the determination of the violation of the accused's Charter rights. The Court found that the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the home as he was used to checking the driver for signs of impairment or smell of alcohol to assess his level of sobriety and that his right to remain silent was violated when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant, Medical Services Incorporated for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. HELD: The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as he had a pneumothorax, collapsed lung, which he associated with the events of water-skiing. The insurance policy under review was in effect from August 1997 to July 1998. During that period, Hurd required medical attention and surgery, performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for together with costs to be taxed. The definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation to extend to Hurd the benefits for which he sues in this action. The final consideration concerns the 'effective date' of the policy referred to in the exclusionary clause. As said in opening, the policy was in affect from July 1997 to August 1998 and covered Hurd for medical services required by him while outside the province of Saskatchewan for three months. During this period, during which time, in February 1998, he required emergency medical treatment and surgery in Chicago. Hurd was unable, as he was not to drive an automobile, to remain within 15 minutes of Mercy Hospital in Chicago and he would immediately return to emergency if the symptoms became more severe. Neither of the quoted terms could be construed as relieving MSI's obligation to pay."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.

The charges against both accused relate to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. 2) The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge. He proceeded on the worst case scenario, that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of mens rea. The accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary or this Court. 3) The Crown argued the accounting records and record keeping were haphazard and sloppy. Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 at 6351: a criminal court is not the forum to determine income taxability and to make determinations as to rights to tax assessment or absence of rights to do so. In this case, the appeal judge was not prepared to make the determinations based on the evidence involved. 4) The retrun of the tax returns was demonstrably false and the record keeping was part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes. It is also consistent with simple sloppiness."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: 1) The children were apprehended from their mother S.D. (the'mother'). The mother took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that they should be immediately returned to her care. 2) The Minister called 18 witnesses including two experts and one mother to testify on the relevant factual matters. It is not disputed that S.T. breached the condition of the PSA allowing only supervised time with the children, but the mother was not happy to have the Ministry involved and never has been. The father of one child, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder, indicated he was unable to attend trial because he was ill. The other child who had been apprehended with severe lice, J.W., did not appear at trial. 3) The mother had three children, all of whom were in the care of the Minister prior to the mother's arrest. The Minister had the mother placed on apprehended status. She was ordered to have regular weekly access for the children for three times per week for a minimum of four hours. The child was to have lunch with the mother and listen to music and dance with her. 4) If the children were found to have Goldenhar Syndrome, the mother would be returned to the Minister for custody of the other child. 5) The evidence in this matter focused on the mother’s change from being hostile to the father during the arrest and detention of the children and her changing attitude towards the mother. The court reviewed the various specialists’ reports and found that the mother had changed. She would no longer put the interests of man before her children."

Dismissing the application, that ""(1) there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the grandchildren were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other; (2) the inherent rights of the parties to attend the discovery should not be displaced by the mere assertion that 'the lines of questioning of each of the plaintiff Grandchildren will be virtually identical' and (3) there was no evidence before the Court that it would be of value to the plaintiffs in being able to assess what one another has said."

He did not defend the civil proceedings and the Plaintiff applied to have her damages assessed. The evidence in the civil trial also disclosed that the Plaintiff had be sexually assaulted by her uncle. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. 1)The Plaintiff had been diagnosed as suffering from severe psychological problems as a result of the sexual assaults. 2)The Court assessed the Plaintiff's non-pecuniary damages at $50,000.00 and apportioned 80% of this sum or $40,000.00 to the step-father. 3)The Plaintiff was also awarded $25,000.00 in punitive damages as against the stepfather.","The defendant was the step-father of the plaintiff. He pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of sexually assaulting her. He was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, subsequently reduced on appeal to six months. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant claiming damages as a result of the sexual assaults. The defendant did not defend the action.HELD: 1)To the extent that damage awards in sexual assault cases represent non-pecuniary damages, the quantification thereof should accord with the principles articulated in J. A. Andrews. 2)The Court's subjective approach to assessing the damages must be utilized primarily with respect to her non pecuniary loss. In most personal injury cases the loss to the plaintiff is caused by the negligence of the defendant. An award of aggravated damages is rarely even considered. But when the claim is founded on sexual assault, the damage inflicted is deliberate. 3)Because the plaintiff has not had any physical basis for the pain and suffering she has undergone, the psychological trauma and emotional distress which she undergoes has been severe. She will continue to suffer to the same extent for an appreciable period of time."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The alleged driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: 1) It is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver’s license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. 2) The evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty. 3) The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for one version of events or the other. Rather, the court must prove that its evidence is credible, and there is no onus on the accused to establish a strict liability offence. The accused was acquitted of all charges."
7_1999canlii3285.txt,"The plaintiff was injured as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found liable. At issue was the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant's insurer for Section B benefits. The defendant paid benefits for 129 weeks. It claimed that the plaintiff misrepresented her employment status at the time of the accident, and that the benefits should be re-paid. The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it. It would be illogical to prevent the defendant from getting its money back when it is found that the benefits were paid on the basis of faulty information provided by the plaintiff. This is not a situation in which estoppel lies against the defendant.","The common law wife of the insured was injured when her car was hit from behind by the defendant's vehicle. The insurance company claimed the plaintiff had not shown that she was employed at the time of the accident. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant and its insurer, pursuant to Schedule 'B' of the Paris insurance policy, for loss of income. She brought this action on the basis that the defendant failed to report any interest in claiming repayment of the money it had paid to her for the past 3 years. The defendant argued that this was a situation in which the plaintiff should have been able to find employment. Awarding the plaintiff $140 per week for 129 weeks, that the plaintiff would have been entitled to full-time employment if she had known that there was a possibility that she would have to pay the money back, but that she did not appear to have done so.

d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The mother, who lives with the maternal grandmother, plans to place the child in the permanent care and custody of the paternal grandmother, who will be responsible for the child's nutrition and physical well-being. The father, V.M., who is a convicted child abuser, has been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of his conviction for child abuse. He has been in contact with the child since apprehension, but there was an indication baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and not ready for it. The maternal grandmother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she were granted custody. HELD: The child was placed with the permanent custody of R.S. (the maternal grandmother) and R.M.'s (the paternal grandmother) plan of care, which was reviewed by the court, was made the sole recommendation that the child be placed with a maternal grandmother who would provide supervised access to both parents on a frequent and regular basis. Although number of her children have been in regular conflict with the law, the mother has always exercised proper parenting skills. Both parents do not have the ability to successfully parent their own child without there being sufficient risks to their healthy development.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant, sole executor of his estate, appealed from a probate decision which had directed him to reimburse the estate for certain bequests and a bequest made to his niece and her brother in the amount of $10,000 to the Zion Lutheran Church. Dismissing the appeal, that the probate judge erred in (1) permitting an order without first requiring proof of and making determination of whether Mr. Saunders was wasting the estate; (2) ordering the executor's file to be delivered to the court; and (3) ordering costs to be awarded on a solicitor and client basis. The appellant had practised law for in excess of forty years before his retirement in the early 1990's and was known to have made a number of small but significant undertakings as executor. His last will, which was submitted to probate in 1997, disclosed that he had converted some of the estate funds to his own use. Bequests 'paid' were listed at $88,000.

The landlord argued the hearing officer erred in his decision on the facts. HELD: The Court is statutorily restricted to addressing questions of law or of jurisdiction. This function means that where there is some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","The plaintiff puts forward that he loaned $5,000 to the defendants, with an additional $1,000 being paid to the plaintiff. The defendants are new to Canada and to large extent reliant upon John and his family for their employment and housing, it would not be out of the ordinary for the plaintiff to provide them with a gift to start their new life in Canada. Although the cheques come from the corporate plaintiff, the corporation is controlled by John. The plaintiff states that he gave the money to the defendant as a gift. The defendant testified that they sent out a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was no request to pay it back earlier. There is no record of what happened between the defendant and the plaintiff except for the fact that the defendant signed the cheque and gave it back. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  1) The amount of damages is not known at this time and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. It may be that there are no damages incurred by the defendant if she can now obtain the payments that she lost. If she is not able to obtain these payments, the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff Lilia.  2) Lilia's counterclaim is not proven on a balance of probabilities. There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the loan was agreed to by Lilia as she was a corporation. It would be simple for the corporation to have asked for and received loan documentation if in fact they were loaning money to them. There of course is no need for documentation if it is simply gift to assist the defendants with their start in Canada journey.  3) The payback of the loan as set out in the statement of claim at $500 per month was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff testified was part of the agreement. It is also unclear as to why the amount of $400.00 was taken, when he stated the agreement was to be $500. This does not affect how Lilia testified that she had worked more than 600 hours, which she had in mind, in order to obtain maternity leave. 4) There were several inconsistencies in the testimony of Lilia, including her testimony that she gave the defendant $2,000 cash"
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (I-10.03) by Ms. [V.G.B.] for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: 1) The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. 2) The child support order was set at a rate higher than the Table amount based on undue hardship. The onus is on the applicant to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income.  3) Section expenses are often referred to as “add ons” to Table support. These expenses cover items that are not normally covered in regular child support orders. Some s. expenses such as those relating to extracurricular activities must be 'extraordinary'. The child’s current income is below the amount normally required for Table support and her standard of living is below that of the respondent. If neither of the parties obtained employment or, in the event the respondent obtains employment, the court must determine whether he obtained employment and, if so, his remuneration from that position."
b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction and sentence following his conviction in Traffic Safety Court for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations'. The Crown tendered evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the court to impose a fine of $200. The traffic justice found the appellant guilty as charged. The appellant did not exercise the voluntary payment option and instead sent an agent to appear on his behalf on the March 10, 2008, return date at which time a 'not guilty' plea was entered and the matter was set down for trial. No one appeared on that date. The Crown was given leave to proceed ex parte and trial was held. The peace officer testified that the appellant was operating his Hummer with after-market tinted windows on a public highway. The police conducted a breath sample after demand was made and the officer issued a certificate of offence. The vehicle had tinted side windows. The officer applied for a copy of the Certificate of offence, which was used to file a written argument on the sufficiency of the charge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed. 1)It was not possible to amend the count to cure the defect. The count cannot be amended so as to breathe life into something that is nullity. 2)Because the count is a nullity and the statute does not provide proper notice to the accused of the nature of the offence or the penalties that may be imposed if a breach is established, the appeal could not be allowed.  3)The Court was of the view that it did not have the statutory authority to make a charge nullity, even if it did provide a proper remedy. The statute does provide a number of steps to remedy the problem, but not the legislative authority to do so. The pleadings were not exact. It was not uncommon for courts to quash informations or indictments for even the smallest technical defect."
b_2012skqb350.txt,"The applicant wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The issue is the interpretation of a consent judgment based on negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not the lawyer involved in the settlement. The wife seeks an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The consent judgment is to be interpreted in the same manner as an agreement. Negotiations are not relevant. The court must examine the context in which the order was issued, evaluate the order in accordance with the circumstances of the case, and question whether the acts or omissions could reasonably have been contemplated to fall under the terms of the order. 2) The wife's outline of the family property and debts provides the necessary context for an appreciation of the discussions that followed, and it is therefore necessary to outline the calculations in some detail. 3) The husband argues that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSPs to adjust for tax implications. He argues that RRSP assets should be significantly discounted to reduced after tax value as at the date of division. To entertain the husband's proposition would be to construe the judgment in an unnatural sense."

The plaintiff's claim was dismissed by court order dated March 21, 2001.

Awarding the plaintiff $2,500 plus disbursements relating to the application, that the jury would be capable of understanding the issues better understood by a properly informed jury. Although the expert evidence was of such complexity and was the usual type of analysis expected with most claims, particularly those involving significantly disabling injuries, it was the case that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied.

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","An appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser-Brace and required them to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. Hartford sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by the respondent that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk and the policy was void and ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues had been raised on appeal including whether the respondent had no obligation to pay the fire loss as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser Brace, was neverAt Risk for Fire Loss by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire, it had no liability to the Province or its insurer for causing the fire. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire nor that there was an obligation to reimburse the respondent for the risk. 2)The appellant's assertion that there should not be an implied implied obligation to contribute by the pre-judgment agreement between the respondent and the insurer as implied by the policy issued to them was not supported by the evidence. 3)The respondent was not required to contribute."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","The accused was charged with unlawfully traffic in a narcotic pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and with unlawfully cultivating marijuana in a vehicle. A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized as a result of a warrantless search. The police officer observed the accused operating a rental van with Ontario licence plates stop on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, he noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and he asked if he could empty his pockets. The accused said he was looking for a place to relieve himself. At this point the police officer indicated that there were no officers working in the detachment that day. HELD: 1) The accused was not detained. He was not asked to open the back of the van. The search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds. It was therefore an unreasonable search in contravention of s. of the Charter.  2) The Court found that the accused did not require a warrant as he did not have any reasonable or probable grounds to believe that the marijuana plants were in the vehicle. 3) The evidence was not relevant to determining whether the accused required any assistance. There were no exigent circumstances upon which the search could have been conducted. 4) Counsel was satisfied the accused was fishing to see what answer he got. The question had nothing to do with determining whether he required assistance. The conversation was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case against the accused. The right to silence as protected by s. 7 is a fundamental right protected by the fundamental right of fundamental justice. It is said the Court recognized that the random stop of motor vehicle amounts to an arbitrary detention and that there is an atmosphere of police authority and compulsion when a motorist is stopped by police officer. The present situation did not involve a roadside check stop. The Court held the accused had been detained arbitrarily whether the detention commenced when the constable stopped him on the street, when he requested him to empty his pants, or when he put him in the rear of the cruiser. Counsel raised the following issues arising from the Charter: 1. Was there an arbitrary detentions contrary to the Charter; 2. Was the search unreasonable contrary to s.(e) the Charter? The Court was satisfied that the officer was conducting an objective search of the vehicle and did not see any evidence of an offence. The issue to be decided was whether the arrest and detention"

The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury. No order as to costs.","The plaintiff applied for an order pursuant to s.55 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act requiring Saskatchewan Government Insurance to pay to the plaintiff the amount awarded to her in a 1998 judgment. The plaintiff had been pinned between an automobile operated by the defendant and a stationary motor vehicle, thereby causing personal injury. She applied for summary judgment, but was required to proceed to a hearing to assess her damages. HELD: There must be a declaration that the plaintiff was precluded, by s. 102 of the Act, from commencing a valid legal action, with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. There will be no order as to costs. Herbert v. Misuga (1994), 1 S. Ct. 292 (C.A.) involved a claim against the defendant motor vehicle driver for damages for assault and battery. The question to be resolved was whether s. 143 of the then The Vehicles Act, 1983, repealed by The Vehicle Administration Act, S.S. 1986, c. V-2.1 applied. In order to accept the submission, it would have been necessary to conclude that the vehicle was not being used as a motor vehicle when it struck the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal could not reach that conclusion and stated that the limitation period in s 143(1)(a) of the Vehicles Act applied. The action was scheduled to proceed without prejudice to SGI's assertion that the claim of the plaintiff is barred by statute."
7_1979canlii87.txt,"The appellant and respondent were adjoining landowners both claiming title to a portion of meadowland described as interval. Both held their property by deeds obtained at tax sales. Dismissing the appeal, that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title to the land and a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from using said lands. The meaning of the word interval in describing lands in North America was discussed.","In a reserved decision, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled to a certificate of title under the Quieting Titles Act to certain lands including the six acre portion in dispute and to a permanent injunction restraining the appellant and her assigns from using the said lands in any way whatsoever. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the evidence more than supported the decision. The respondent relied on the deed to himself and to his predecessors in title and claimed title to the 73-acre parcel of land and to six acres of meadowland in dispute. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The land was encompassed by the two tax deeds. 2)If the word 'interval' did not appear in the explanation of the lands conveyed by the deed from the respondent to the appellant, it was more than amply supported by the evidence. 3)The respondent must show title by documentary proof, by clear evidence of conventional line or by adverse possession. The adverse possession claimed had not been established and so find because it was not adverse, continuous, open and notorious. 4)The appellant's conveyance of the land to her husband (and subsequently to her) convinced him that it was a straight line division and the acreage shortfall sustained by him was due to the bend in the river."
b_2013skpc213.txt,HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with committing sexual assault and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the assault because of the way he treated her. She also alleged that he had fondled her and smelled alcohol on her. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court found that the credibility of the witnesses was the most significant issue and an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken. It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt. The evidence of K.S., when describing what had occurred in her bedroom, told the Court that the accused had pulled the blanket away and that he removed his pants. The accused testified that he did not know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants when she told the officer that she said 'no'. Further examination of all the evidence is necessary.  1) The Court was the trier of fact and law so am obliged to decide the facts in this case by applying the same principles that a jury would be required to apply. 2) The accused had not consumed alcohol until he drank vodka in the trailer that evening but his recollection of what happened was detailed and his evidence was not shaken in cross examination. 3) The complainant's testimony was entirely consistent with that of other witnesses. There was no suggestion that she was motivated by revenge or anything of the sort that was raised in the context of the statements made by the accused and the witnesses. The court found that although the complainant may not have believed the accused's version of events, she had not been convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by his evidence in a courtroom setting. Further examination is necessary to determine how the instructions are to be considered."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. The provisions of the Act provide for an implicit scheme of delegation of authority to be exercised by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. There was no error by the trial judge in finding that the returns purportedly filed were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. The appellants had filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents filed. The appeal was dismissed.
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out the statements of defence and counter-claim of Jeffrey and Karen Rilkoff and the separate statement of defence of Helen. The plaintiffs claim their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was a different cause than those dealt with in the 1989 and 1992 judgments. The defendants have referred to judgment of this Court in support of their allegation that if the resolutions authorizing the assessments do not include a provision for charging interest on unpaid assessments and solicitor/client costs, the plaintiffs are not entitled to do so. They also alleged that the issues raised in the defendants' statement of defense do not disclose a reason for their claim and do not show a reasonable cause of action. HELD: The application of the plaintiffs was bedismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The preconditions for hearing applications pursuant to Rule 188 are quite different to those relating to Rule 173 in that an application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justiciable dispute is revealed. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve what appeared to be rather serious questions of law. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Queen’s Bench Rule 188, which permits resolution of those sorts of questions prior to trial if the resolution thereof will resolve the dispute between the parties or significant aspects of the dispute. It was also asserted that the raising of such issues is an abuse of the process of the court. 3)Costs were bedisted with the plaintiffs’ application in the cause of thecause."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused seeks an order granting a trial in the City of Prince Albert or such other judicial centre as the Court deems appropriate. The Crown counsel opposed the application. HELD: 1)It is well established that jurors may enter the trial with biases. But the law presumes that jurors' views and biases will be cleansed by the trial process. It therefore does not permit a party to challenge their right to sit on the jury because of the existence of widespread bias alone. 2)A reasonably serene environment is still possible in Saskatoon. The majority of media reports are over a year old. There is no evidence that the media reports have created a frightened or enraged community such as was the case in Charest. The more recent reports are generally factual references to the progress of the case. There are safeguards in the system to cleanse the jurors' eyes. 3)The onus is on the accused to establish by evidence that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the closest judicial district. In the circumstances, despite the examples of media coverage referred to in the affidavits, there is no question that the accused has not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application."
3_1994canlii3972.txt,"After an argument with his girlfriend, the appellant drove his car at high speed with the lights off, running two stop signs. At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.","The 19-year-old appellant pled guilty to three charges of dangerous driving causing bodily harm following an argument with his girlfriend. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. He suffered a broken arm and an undisplaced pelvic fracture and fractured ribs, and two fractures to his cervical spine. He also had five previous motor vehicle accidents and three infractions involving the use of motor vehicle. The three Criminal Code convictions indicate a lack of respect for the law, which was demonstrated as well in his actions at issue. The appeal was dismissed."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sues the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant applied to renew the application. The issue was whether the judge should have granted the amendment because this case did not fall into any of the specific powers to amend in the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the application to set aside was allowed. The decision on whether the amendment should be granted was not appealed. The matter was left to the Supreme Court to decide. 1)Limidity of the Rules in relation to limitation periods had limited the judge's discretion to grant the amendment; the Rule 5.04(2)(b) and (c)authority to amend did not apply in this case. 2)The limitation period had intervened and an important consideration relates to whether the appellant's delay has prejudiced the defendant's defence. Lombard should receive notice in these circumstances."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arose. HELD: The Court of Appeal declined to admit a nonsuit. 1)The Chief of the Provincial Police interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of payments for sexual favours was contemplated. 2)The entire reasons must be read to understand the true ratio. 3)The facts before the learned Chief judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female Person for the purposes of engaging with a specific sexual service and for which he intended to pay. The evidence is similar to that of the respondent in that he approached a woman unknown to him in an area where prostitutes were plying their trade, invited her into his automobile, inquired if she was interested in sex and wanted to know if the police officer was a police officer. There was no need, in view of our disposition, to conduct an extensive review of the facts. There is no need to conduct a re-hearing of the entire oral judgment."
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused, charged with impaired driving, applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for a variety of remedies, including a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure.HELD: The Court found that the officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused and, in the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light in this case, the trial was unfair in a way that it was not satisfied can be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or by exclusion. The Court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused's rights under s. 7 were infringed."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The applicant appealed the chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act because the Director's application constituted a multiplicity of proceedings and was therefore an abuse of process. The Chambers judge did not meet the three tests set out in s. 25(1)(a) and s. 2(b) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and neither she nor the applicant applied to strike the stay or any of the other applications. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the jurisdiction to hear the appeal was limited by the provisions of s. 24 of The Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and that a stay was not appropriate. As the applicant did not ask to overturn factual determinations made by the Hearing Officer, he failed to determine that the broader test for abuse of a process had been met. The application before the court was determined to be an interlocutory appeal from decision which is part of an application under SCAN."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: 1) The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997. In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by a third party) as they concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. 2) At an interim stage it is often quoted that the paramount consideration at an early stage of the breakdown is “need and ability to pay”. However, this is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount claimed. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousa rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband. The wife’s application for an interim payment of the property is dismissed. 3) At this interim stage the wife must absorb the immediate cost of the dispute.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,"The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been found to be much greater. The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and this was accepted by the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. The appellant's income is largely the product of the operation of a relatively small farm, augmented by some outside earnings. The trial judge accepted the respondent's income by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of myCapital cost allowance. What, if any, portion of the capital cost allowances should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible error in the acceptance of this figure by the Chamber judge in this instance."

The Attorney General opposed severance on the ground the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the Government of Canada and the Oblates. HELD: It was in the best interests of justice that the order of severance be granted so the issue may proceed to an early trial. The issues of cross-claim and third party proceedings will take a very lengthy period of time. Hundreds of other claimants who have been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff's action as a test case were awaiting a judgment.,FIAT: The applicant applied for an order severing the issues raised by his claim from those raised by the cross-claim and third party proceedings so that his claim may proceed to trial. The respondent vigorously opposed severance on the grounds that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced in its claim for apportionment of the amount of any judgment as between the governments of Canada and Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba. HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant was granted so that the issue raised in the action could proceed to an early trial.  The action and the other actions pending resolution of this action were fairly dealt with under the Rules. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issues are severed are groundless.
9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife. She had given him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. He refused and pushed the wife against the wall. She tried to prevent him from leaving but he pursued her. He hit her and butted out a cigarette on her hand. At approximately 2:00 a.m. the following morning he returned to the wife's residence without any clothes on. He was inebriated and appeared to have difficulty remembering anything from the time he went out to have some drinks at bar at the Grand Hotel until the next morning when he woke up in his wife's apartment. He then went out drinking with some friends. He had no recollection of what happened next. Upon his return he was found not guilty. The respondent appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the Crown must prove an accused applied force intentionally in the case of an assault charge but to warrant acquittal based on intoxication the evidence of intoxication must be such that it shows an accused to have an absence of awareness akin to a state of automatism."
e_1992canlii2523.txt,"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in sentencing him to four years for an armed robbery charge, one year on a weapons charge to be served consecutively and a 10 year prohibition order because there were extenuating circumstances which should have resulted in a reduction in sentence.

The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","This was an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although the appellant pled guilty to each of the two offences, there were extenuating circumstances in his favour that should have detracted from his conviction, there was nothing that the court could do about that. The appellant was represented by counsel. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and 1 year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively. For the reasons given, the Court dismissed the appeal."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The application before the chambers judge also included child maintenance issues but the father does not appeal that part of the decision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge was entitled to consider only the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination, by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. 2) The evidentiary threshold necessary to make a decision based on all the uncontroverted evidence has been met. 3) There was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The matter was remitted to Queen's Bench for determination."
6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","Plaintiff's bankruptcy petition was filed in 1995 and received an absolute discharge in March 1996. The trustee never applied for discharge. HELD: The order for costs was granted. 1)Discounted non-exempt equity in the homestead did not exist at the time of the application for discharge nor after the trustee applied for it. The caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that any increase in the equity will accrue to the benefit of the creditors. 2)The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, the trustee stated that her duties under the Act had been satisfactorily performed; that her conduct either before or after the bankruptcy was not subject to censure; and that she had not committed any offence in connection with the bankruptcy. 3)The respondent's argument that it is appropriate in summary bankruptcy administration proceedings for a trustee to withhold timely application for release and await market enhancement of the value of non- exempt equity in homestead property can be taken by the trustee. Here the trustee was discharged whereas here the trustee is not. The respondent took the position that the applicant had no interest in the real property acquired after her bankruptcy and that if the applicant elected to re-open her homestead it would be subject to an absolute order. She also complained of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it because there was no hearing associated with her discharge. She alleged that the transmission was an arbitrary action taken without her agreement and knowledge and that there were no conditions precedent precedent precedent setting forth such an application. Costs will be provided by the applicant."
c_2007skqb355.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action pursuant to Rules 222, 231 and 232 of the Queen's Bench Rules and an order requiring the third parties to provide further and better disclosure of documents in their power pursuant to Rules 212 and 215. HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiffs also ask for further and better disclosure of documents over which a claim for privilege is asserted. The defendant maintains that the documents referred to in the plaintiff's Reply to the Government of Saskatchewan's Demand for Particulars form part of those contracts and set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the defendants in entering into the contracts. The third parties deny all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant as a third party claimant and specifically deny that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant. HELD: The court will not unduly restrict an examination by excluding questions broadly related to the issues that may well be resolved by other evidence not before the court on the application. The broad relevance test is test of credibility. The court reviewed the relevant authorities and found that the relevance test to the application for discovery was broad and wide. The Court found that, pursuant to the governing legislation, the third party contractors were not liable to pay PST because the cement was supplied, used and installed into the real property of the plaintiff. Further, the court found that if the third parties were liable to refund the PST to the plaintiff that was collected and levied in error by third parties, then the defendant was entitled to payment of PST from them on the cement consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff"
b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","A medical doctor brought an action against three doctors alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all the doctors to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, the Pipestone District Health Board. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)There was no law supporting the existence of a Trust or a Fiduciary relationship between the doctors and the defendant. The fact that the hospital was neither the originator of the on call arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it, and there were serious questions about his professional competence. 2)The relationship between hospital and its doctors, here, was not defined by the standards of the Moosomin College or any other college. Nor was it an enforceable relationship. 3)The court dismissed the action against the third doctor, Crouse, Kirsch, on the basis that it was not inconsistent with the standards set out in Moosnomin College. Neither doctor entered into a trust or a fiduary relationship with the other. Neither party was a party to the arrangement. 4)The common characteristics of a relationship between a doctor and a patient are: a class or category, or of such nature in fact, as to give rise to one of them. A relationship between doctors and patients is not defined either by Moosni College or the Saskatchewan College of Physicians."
7_2001canlii346.txt,"The Crown withdrew one count at the opening of the trial and the accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration in excess of .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called as witnesses the boyfriend of the accused's sister-in-law and the doctor of a civilian who at the time was an inmate. The accused testified at trial that he had had the doctor complete the wrong form for the wrong reason and that the doctor advised him that the taking of the blood would not endanger his life or health. HELD: The Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had acted in the best interests of his life and that he was 100% sure that the blood was taken from the accused. The Court concluded that the facts in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so. Based on the officer's testimony that he asked the permission of the doctor to take the blood, and his evidence that he did not recall signing the second certificate, and on the evidence of other witnesses who testified that they had seen the accused in the hospital, the Court found that the officer had no reason whatsoever to taint his evidence by favouring either the Crown or the accused and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the Crown had proved that the Blood was actually taken by the accused or his friends. On the evidence as a whole, the Crown was left with reasonable doubt as to who actually took the blood."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After being detained at the police station, he attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers. Eventually, he spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused argued the admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute as it would violate the accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights. HELD: The Court held the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body when he located him in the police vehicle was not raised as part of the reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand. The Certificate of Analyses was admitted into evidence. The Court found the accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes until the demand was made for a breath sample and the taking of the sample was 11 minutes because the officer was not advised of the reason for the detention. The delay was of relatively short duration compared to the 33 minutes in Hatzel, but the Court found that the officer's grounds for demanding the samples were irrelevant as the accused did not have a lawyer and had not been informed of his right to consult counsel prior to making the demand. Finally, the Court held that the certificate of analysis would not be excluded as it was a form of disclosure for the accused."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving a motor vehicle while suspended, contending that the adjudicator failed to properly interpret the provisions of s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, and thereby failed to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the appellant. The adjudicator also rejected the evidence of three other witnesses, a police officer and a mixed breed dog, who testified that they had seen the appellant get out of the vehicle while unlicensed. Allowing the appeal, that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; there was insufficient evidence to prove the appellant was in fact the driver of the car; and other grounds as may appear from the record. The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. It remains open to an appellate court to overturn a verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable."
6_2009skca97.txt,"The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants. The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs. The proposed respondent applied for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs returned. The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted. The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 406-10. The proposed respondent provided an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $12,000 as security in accordance with the requirements of Rule 408 and the sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs in her possession. She then applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for an order setting aside the writ, and ordering the dogs to be returned to her on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted.

In an application to quash committal for trial there is only one ground for action by the reviewing court and that is lack of jurisdiction. (2)Application dismissed. The conditions imposed by the Provincial Court Judge were justified. He did not err in law or in his application of the facts.,"FIAT.

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts being a curfew breach and an alcohol abstention breach on his part. The Court also found that the accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which takes him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. In addition, the Court found that there was a breach of the peace because the complainant did not recognize him as a police officer. The accused was also found to have committed breach of a peace officer by striking the officer in the nose and breaking his nose."

After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action. The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence. Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled. Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","The plaintiff, through her numbered company, assumed the operation of the Maritime Motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor, Metro Computerized Bookkeeping, advised her that if the lease was not executed within a reasonable time, she would require the return of the security deposit.

The Court found that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations.

The Court had preferred to adjourn the discharge hearing for a period of 6 months. This would allow the Court to assess the financial circumstances of the bankrupt and her spouse at that time.

c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the Court or alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct counsel in this law suit. The applicants were reluctant to initiate the procedure to have the plaintiff undergo another mental competency examination due to this intervening law suit and the fear of being further accused of improper conduct or improper motives in doing so. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court was not obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. The Act, despite its pejorative title, exists at this point in time solely to legislate the procedures to be followed in determining if a person is mentally incompetent to manage his or her estate. 2)There is no need for the Court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction if the remedy sought is readily available to the applicant, for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed. This is not a case where it would be inappropriate that the Court should order a single examination for determination of an issue where there is no acceptable medical evidence on the issue. Rather than attempting to set down a new set of procedural safeguards for a determination of a person's mental competence to engage in civil litigation, with the inevitable time and costs associated with the trial of such an issue, it is preferable that the procedures outlined in existing legislation be resorted to for any such determination."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.",FIAT: The action commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act (the Act) and is now represented by an amended Statement of Claim. The application seeks a discretionary order pursuant to s. 37(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and/or Rule 173 of the QS Bench Rules of Court. The applicants argue that this action and these proceedings are an abuse of the court's process and that the court has the statutory and inherent jurisdiction to order the action stayed. HELD: The Court acknowledges the continuing challenges that are raised with respect to the judicial management and handling of multi-jurisdictional class actions. The Court also notes that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be considered by the Court during the certification application of this class action. These concerns may be of some assistance to the Court as it is now 'no costs' jurisdiction providing for the certification of a national multi- jurisdictional class action on an 'opt-out' basis.
d_2004nssf61.txt,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age. She proposed to sell the home and put the proceeds, together with a new mortgage, towards the purchase of a new home. Joint custody awarded for all four children, with the father to have primary care and control of the oldest and the mother to have primary care and control of the three younger children; the father is to pay child support for three children in the guideline amount and the mother is to pay child support for one child in the guideline amount; the husband's equity in the matrimonial home is frozen at the amount owing on the mortgage when the parties separated and his interest is postponed until the youngest child reaches the age of 21 years; if the wife wishes to obtain a new home in a new location, she will be required to pay out the husband's equity in the matrimonial home.","The petitioner sought a divorce and custody, child support and an order directing that the respondent's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child was 19 years old. The respondent sought to sell the home and build a new house and claimed that he was entitled because he stayed home and cared for the children throughout the marriage and lost his opportunity to enter the work force earlier. The husband argued that he would need to replace his vehicle, have a line of credit, pay child support of $25,000 and retire the septic tank at his residence. HELD: The respondent's request to postpone the child support payments was granted as a result of a permanent breakdown of the marriage was granted. The court ordered the respondent to pay $1,500 per month in child support plus $350 for orthodontic expenses and $500 for home improvement. An equal division of the assets and joint custody of the children was ordered, with the respondent having primary care and the remaining child having the right to access the children whenever they were not in school. Child support payments were to be directed to the Maintenance Enforcement Program and the respondent was to have regular monthly payments of $300 to $400 for the two youngest children and $300 per month for extracurricular activities. Although there was some strain in the relationship, this should not interfere with the petitioner's reasonable access with reasonable notice.  1)Access was ordered with costs to the respondent in the amount of $55,000 per year for the next four years to be determined by the court based on the parties' credit scores. 2)The respondent's claim for spousal support was dismissed as there was no basis for it. 3)The court was not prepared to order a further postponement of the child care expenses for the purposes of calculating special and extraordinary expenses."

The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application for an order prohibiting the law firms from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the bankrupt estate. The Trustee had been appointed by the bankrupt as custodian of its property, and as such was subject to the scrutiny of the Court. The bankrupt estate had been experiencing financial difficulties during the course of which it appointed Ernst Young as its custodian, and it had guaranteed payment of its creditors' fees and disbursements under the terms of the debenture. It sought the removal of these counsels. The respondent acknowledged that there are areas of potential conflict with the interests of both the trustee and the bank, but argued that to order the trustee to retain other counsel would create a great financial burden because of the time required by new counsel to acquaint itself with information already in the knowledge of present counsel. In his dissenting opinion, the Court found that the mere existence of a claim by a creditor as against the petitioning creditor could not per se be grounds for removing counsel. It also referred to a Supreme Court of Canada decision in MacDonald Estate v. Martin Rossmere Holdings (1990), which held that if a bankrupt asks a trustee to take an action against him or her, the trustee must be mindful of the relationships between the parties and not be in a position where it could appear that the trustee is influenced by the Bank in making that decision."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support were sworn by an RCMP officer. Each alleges that a middle-aged man and his 19-year old daughter have committed incest, and that child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. The applications depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother (herein 'the natural mother' of the 19- year old female) and that the DNA of the baby is not linked in any satisfactory fashion to the alleged father. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of the fetus. This statement should ordinarily be included. The Court was of the view that a DNA warrant application with respect to the baby would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the present applications is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or carried by the victim at the time of the offence was committed. There was nothing from either of the parties who could give an informed consent, instruct counsel, or otherwise avail itself of the information required to be provided pursuant s.485(1)(b) of the Code. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the child's blood. The natural mother has had no timely association whatever with the alleged offence. It is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. Application respecting the month old child The conclusions reached after analyzing each subparagraph individually are reinforced by the fact that the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples has a certificate or any similar qualification, nor is the qualification of the corporal who trained him set out. In and of themselves, these deficiencies would probably not preclude issuance of a warrant. The Crown must provide some basic evidence which can satisfy the court that the technician or expert who will carry out DNA procedures is properly qualified to do so."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This is an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The facts of the case are reasonably straightforward. The applicant is a First Nations faculty member and the grievance alleged that the University had interfered with his academic freedom. The allegation had to do with the withdrawal of an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at a conference held in mid-March. The respondent had received his Ph.D. from the University of Regina but believed he was being invited to present the results of research he had done for an Assembly of First Nations national First Nations political organization. In any event, there is no disputing the applicant's claim that he was invited to speak at the symposium, but the reasons as a whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs.  1) Before passing upon the merits of the application it is necessary to determine the standard of review to be applied to the decision of the Board of Governors. Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Voice Construction Ltd. v. Construction General Workers' Union (2004 SCC 23) the law in this regard has been reasonably well settled. Following the pragmatic and functional approach referred to in the judgment, it is clear the Standard of Review to be apply in this case is one of reasonability. 2) In this case the applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. 3) There is no question that the applicant violated the collective agreement. However, the Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the applicant was acting in his capacity as Chair of the University's Board and not as an officer of the Federation. That finding brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. 4) The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the respondent's academic freedom in the second paragraph under the heading NATURE OF DISPUTE. These actions by FNUC and its Board have interfered with the academic liberty of this faculty member, in violation of the FNUC/URFA Academic Collective Bargaining Agreement (2002-2005).

By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by the Bank. The applications are brought pursuant to ss. 63 and 66 of The Personal Property Security Act.

The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than 1 year' within the meaning of the PPSA and it required registration. 2) The Court concludes that the lease was a lease for more than one year and it is entitled to registration.

The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: This is a high-conflict family law matter. The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two children) presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this year and beyond. The parties married in 2008 and separated in 2011. Two years ago the mother unilaterally moved with the children to Kenaston, notwithstanding an existing order of this court. She has formed a new relationship and she is pregnant. While the father has been in jail for a number of criminal matters, he was sentenced in October. His latest affidavit is not entirely clear on how long he will be in jail, but states he is eligible for early release in December 2013. These are fact-intensive and there is no presumption in favour of the present custodial parent. The children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. This matter has not gone to trial and is far from concluded. However, the mother's willingness (or lack of same) to ensure a connection between the children and their father may well be a factor in her remaining the primary parent. HELD: The court ordered the children have telephone access to their father every three weeks, as may be arranged, until he is released from custody. The telephone access shall be converted accordingly. 1)It appears beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to the children. There is nothing suggesting the two boys have anything other than a close and loving relationship with her. While personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances, the court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two young children visiting their father in jail would benefit. 2)There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. As well, the parties should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime or one of the other means of electronic audio/visual communication. Some form of monitoring might be possible."

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","A licensed realtor appeals the finding of unprofessional conduct made by a discipline sub-committee of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08. The Court found that the complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the imposition of the other sanctions, fails to meet the standards placed on the Committee. The Committee's decision was quickly made which did not reflect the time needed to consider the totality of the evidence presented. The Commission erred in law by having no juristic basis to apply such a harsh and severe penalty."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","The applicant sought an order declaring that the land use by-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had a special premises liquor license which allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) this license was for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) no advertising of the availability of liquor service was permitted. The change in the liquor license sought by the applicant would only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. The club's use was not a 'change in use' as it was not defined in either the By-law or the Municipal Government Act. A development agreement was required."

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This was an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue was whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. It follows that, as of the date of the supplier's demand, these books were not'subject to any agreement for Sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v).

4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition and Leonard Banga. The plaintiffs brought three causes of action and claimed damages over and above what might be referred to as normal damages. The defendants were alleged to have induced the plaintiff to abandon his previous employment and sought damages for actions that amounted to defamation. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were using the contents of this statement of claim in an attempt to prove their allegation that the defendant had defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. The applicants sought the following relief: 1) Rule 13-8 of the Queen's Bench Rules provides for the striking of portions of the paragraphs that appear to be plead facts. 2) Rule 7-9 is similar to former Rule 139(1) of the former Rule 173 which provides in part that a pleading or other document is to be struck. These facts are material to the plaintiffs' case as they are necessary to adequately define the nature of the action and to any moral damages flowing from it. 3) The defendants plead facts which, if proven, would establish they were fully aware that the plaintiffs were in no way responsible for any acts of intimidation and harassment and that they dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. As such, they are irrelevant to the plaintiff's action in defamation. 4) The pleadings do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. 5) The paragraphs contain references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club which would lead reasonable people to believe that the plaintiff is referring to them. 6) The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision to the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. 7) Ibid."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order for child maintenance retroactive to the date of their separation. Prior to the consent order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father had made overtures to the mother for increased child maintenance but had refused to provide any additional amount. The mother applied for relief pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act in October 2007. Consent Order dated January 9, 2009 provided relief to almost all of the issues raised in the proceeding, including ongoing child maintenance beginning January 4, 2008. What remains for decision is what responsibility, if any, the father has to retroactively provide child maintenance since the couple separated in 2001 up to the end of 2007. The federal regime appears to have contemplated limiting the recipient parent's request for information about the father's income to a three-year period. There is agreement as to the status of the child that the current child maintenance award will apply to the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. HELD: 1) The mother has a responsibility to provide child support to the father on a retroactive basis. This responsibility lies with the father. He has failed to provide sufficient notice to the recipient that his child support obligations are being met when (s)he knows that they are not. This failure to provide income in accordance with the Guidelines should be corrected from the date the child was born. 2) The father's dramatic increase in salary was sufficient notice his child maintenance obligation had to be increased. He did, on occasion, make additional payments with regard to some of the items put forward by the mother. His request for retroactive award is denied. 3) The parents have an obligation to provide support to their son pursuant to s. 7 of the Guidelines. The Father's Responsibility to Provide Child Support in the Year 2005/06 is granted by the Court of Appeal with respect to child maintenance payable by the father for the child beginning January 1, 2007 and continuing to December 2008. The current order requires payment of $687.00 month. It is not ordered that the father retroactively pay child maintenance for the year 2006/07 but rather that he retroactively provides child support for his son in the years 2007/08 and beyond. This is an important step in the process. The Court would ask the applicant to prepare the order."

The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","HELD: The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of a search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. The trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. He argued that this was the limit set forth in the warrant and, on that basis, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court rejected the application on the basis that there was no evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and listen to on the Internet. 2)There is no evidence to suggest either officer looked for, or even considered looking for, a picture of someone who might be the complainant. They simply did not look for a specific picture to attempt to either provide independent evidence or to provide evidence to further corroborate the complainant's allegations. This is so, apparently, despite the assertion Sgt. Kuan was specifically advised by Cst. Logan of the possible presence of picture of the complainant on the accused’s computer. 3)The Court found that the search for child pornography was inexorably and inexactly directed by the Crown to the conclusion this was a case to obtain and obtain child pornography. It was not possible to devise a reasonable course of investigation based on the evidence collected. 4)The court found that, on balance, the admission of evidence obtained by a Charter breach would bring to the Administration of justice a negative consequence. It is therefore difficult to conceive a s. breach with greater impact on the Charter-protected privacy interests than occurred in this case. 5)The personal nature of all the information on the computer was emphasized by the Court as a factor to be weighed: the negative impact of admission of"
c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","The plaintiff rented paint sprayer from a shop which was owned by the defendant. He signed a form of agreement and was told how to clean the gun part of the sprayer after completion of the work. No warning was given respecting any hazards in using the sprayers, and no warning was printed on the agreement. At issue was the defendant's liability forfailure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using anairless paint sprayers. The plaintiff suffered a partial loss of an index finger when he inadvertently placed his finger in front of the nozzle. He sought to retain as much of the finger as possible, claiming loss of income, past and future. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $18,789 plus $5,000 plus costs and pre-judgment interest. 1)The non-pecuniary damage issue was uncomplicated. An ordinary user of this sprayer would not appreciate the disastrous consequences of his failing to take adequate precautions to protect himself and his property. 2)Given the plaintiff's unique situation and the fact that he was unable to function at his job for about 3 months after the amputation and required an extra man to help him with the painting project, the plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. Had the claim been adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened."

The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive.

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the applicant and subsequent purchaser for value, the Saskatchewan Valley Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The facts are not in dispute and are fully set out in the judgment of the trial judge. The trial judge found that the respondent, the secured party, had to authorize the buyer to deal with the security and that the buyer must know of the authorization. HELD: The appellant was awarded costs in the usual way of double column V. The Court of Appeal is not seeking to take the position of the Credit Union based on the reasons of this trial judge but is seeking to find priorities as between the parties. The appellant's rights against Nickle are restricted to the proceeds. The Credit Union appeals. The issue on the appeal is reduced to whether the respondent authorized the sale of the security, the mobile home and its proceeds and whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full.  1) Section 28 of the PPSA contemplates the secured creditor (the lanson) authorizing the debtor to dealwith the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay a secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 2) The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd. (Cuming and Wood, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, 1994) for a comparison of conditional authorization and authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to a secured party. At trial it was found that Lanson did not authorize the sale, the express condition that the security interest would only be released on payment of the entire proceeds in circumstances where all parties, including the vendor the purchaser and the holder of the secure interest, had knowledge of the Security interest. That is not the case here. Canadian commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured partner agrees with the purchaser to release the security in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds; there is a distinction between conditional authorization ( conditional authorization) and an authorization (e.g. allowing a Credit Union to acquire the security), and a conditional sale(e). Both are conditional in nature. Both are subject to conditional conditions. The credit union appealed."

HELD: 1)The affidavit evidence was insufficient to determine income. 2)The respondent was to impute 15% of the capital cost allowance claimed on personal property to the applicant pursuant to s19 in each of the above years. 3)The applicant had appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she had deducted a portion of her home and vehicle expenses; that portion which is attributable to her business. The applicant's average income for those three years, that is her income for the purposes of calculating s.7 expenses is $32,243. That is the respondent's income for purposes of determining child support according to the tables."
9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.",The plaintiff sought an injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing on the premises of their employer. The picketers were obstructing the entrance to the employer's premises for up to 20 minutes and some of the employees were prevented from entering the premises for more than an hour. HELD: 1)The acts complained of were illegal and had caused and continue to cause loss and damage to the plaintiff including damage of the plaintiff's business. 2)The defendants were granted leave to file and serve materials. 3)The injunction would continue until the trial of the alleged acts. 4)The plaintiff was ordered to pay costs. 5)The court was unable to find a clear and unequivocal precedent for this principle in any of the numerous decisions at all relevant to the question.
5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","The accused was charged with having in his possession, crack cocaine, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. A voir dire held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search of the accused and the admissibility of 17.8 grams of crack cocaine found on the young person. The police had earlier determined that the accused would be held overnight and taken to court the following day to be arraigned on a charge of possession of stolen vehicle. The accused had placed a call to a drug transaction and arranged for someone to meet him at an agreed upon location to complete the drug transaction. The officer told the accused that he could get the vehicle back by arranging a drug deal. At the time of the call, the accused said that the officer told him that the drugs were in his underwear and that he pulled them out of his underwear. The young person was not made aware of the fact that the search was conducted for the purpose of finding drugs, nor was it specifically related to the reasons for the arrest itself. However, significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the youth person and emphasize enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected. The strip search, conducted as a part of the trial proper, was conducted to preserve evidence and to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. Although the time period estimated by the police at around 30 seconds, that time span appeared to encompass the time from when the arrestee removed clothing and remove the drugs from the underwear to the time that they were removed from his underwear, even by the accused's account. The time period calculated by the court was approximately 15 minutes. The search was motivated by a degree of urgency and in a way that ensured the loss of drugs, prevented their destruction, and prevented their dissemination in the jail setting or at the courthouse. The evidence heard on the voir-dire did not rest on the presumption that the evidence should be excluded from the evidence. Rather, it was the youth's recollection of the conversation with the officer that led him to conclude that the officers had conducted a 'pat-down' search. The youth was not aware that the presence of drugs in the vehicle associated with the trafficking of cocaine, nor did he have any prior knowledge of the location of the drugs. The interaction between the youth and the officer was brief and meaningful. The interactions between the officer and the accused were brief and respectful."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he has an honest but mistaken belief in consent. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence. It is open to the accused to claim that the complainant's words and actions, before and during the incident, raise a reasonable doubt against her assertion that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent?"

The plane crashed in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff, claiming negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the parts, commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The defendants applied to declare Nova Scotia forum non conveniens. Dismissing the application, that there is a real and substantial connection to both jurisdictions and the plaintiff's forum choice appeared reasonable and should not be disturbed.","The plaintiff alleged that in 1988 he purchased aircraft parts from the defendants, such parts being parts being PA-11 fuselage. The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling such parts in the U.S.A. The aircraft crashed in August 1992, and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in the manufacture or construction of the package. The defendants applied to have the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to has the action stayed on the basis of forum conveniens. Forum non conveniens were found in this case and the plaintiffs choice of forum was a reasonable one."

On the drive home, she was injured in a motor vehicle accident when she fainted and her car crossed the centre line of the highway and struck another vehicle. She sued three members of the clinic staff, including the doctor who performed the abortion, alleging negligence in letting her drive after the abortion. Awarding the plaintiff $724,000 for past and future loss of income, future loss of pension, and general damages, that based on the evidence of the possible complications from surgery such as an abortion, and considering the emotional impact of an abortion on all women, the defendants breached their standard of care as health care professionals in permitting the plaintiff to drive after the abortion.","The plaintiff nurse brought an action against the defendants, alleging that they were negligent in allowing her to drive home after having an abortion despite having specifically been advised not to do so. The female plaintiff sought an order of judgment for $115,000.00. The order provided that the two actions would be heard together because of common issues, but that the assessment of damages for the plaintiff would be held at a later date. The court found that one defendant did not exist and was simply listed as a defendant by mistake. The other defendant was found not to be a party to the action."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club and the Village of Bjorksdale. The action arose out of burns suffered by the respondent while participating in a demolition derby run by the Lions Club with the assistance of the fire department. The fire department was standing by in the sense that it had a fire truck parked nearby and had some of its members in attendance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed in its entirety. The respondents shall have their costs taxed in the usual way. The Court found that the trial judge employed the right test in addressing the motion, having addressed it along the lines of whether the plaintiff had adduced sufficient evidence, considered in its best light, to enable the jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, to find the defendants or either them liable in negligence. The jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same as in the respondents' case. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents."
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered a declaration interpreting the bylaws of the Condominium Corporation with regard to the election of the members of the Board with a view to determining the voting rights of the commercial owners. It found that principles of contract interpretation had no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of a condominium bylaw. Principles were not appropriate in this application. A sample of the applicant's affidavit material was provided to the parties. It was clear from the interpretation that the applicant was asking that the Court disregard portions of his affidavit that the bylaw was not intended to be interpreted as being contrary to the commercial owner's voting rights. As there were only seven positions on the Board, a vote was required. The applicant was also asking the court for a declaration that all of the board members were entitled to vote on all questions proposed at a meeting of unit owners.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine (Cocaine for the Purpose of Trafficking) and contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused had been bound by a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court function for the purpose of trafficking. One of the terms of the probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had permission of the Court to do so. The Crown conceded that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal provided some guiding principles on the use of s.(5)(1) of The Code in its R. v. E.W. decision. HELD: The accused was placed on a 6 month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts on which he was convicted. He was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody followed by 12 months probation. 1)The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. There was no evidence that this activity of the accused, who was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge, ought never be considered routine or usual. The Court found that the very existence of cocaine and heroin in the trafficking operation was itself an aggravating factor in and of itself. 2)The accused had served approximately thirty days in remand and did not appear to benefit by any more time in actual custody. The Youth Court Worker was qualified as an expert to testify on the characteristics of drug operation and street values and would have been in a better position to advise the accused on the appropriate use of the tools available to him. 3)There was little to no evidence he was motivated by financial gain or anything less than custody would satisfy the principles of sentencing set out in s. 38 of the Code."
5_1998canlii13934.txt,"Landlord and Tenant - Writ of Possession_____ The landlord applied for an order for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm. The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The remaining alleged breaches could not be determined summarily.  3)Costs of the application were awarded to the landlord in any event of the cause.","The landlord applied for a writ of possession pursuant to s50 of the Landlord and Tenant Act. The applicants had entered a lease with the landlords in 1995 with respect to land which had been damaged by a 1995 hail storm. The previous owners had promised to repair the damageto the premises from a hail storm which occurred in 1995 and the damage had never been repaired. The respondents were in arrears of rent by more than 2 months and in breach of their covenant to obtain and maintain suitable insurance up on the leased premises. The applicant had installed two new stalls in the barn and the applicant was required to give notice of the claim of set off to the landlord. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed to determine whether the respondents were IN breach of the covenant to pay rent and the alleged failure to maintain proper weed control. 1)The payment due May 1998 was not made because, they allege, Russell has breached the lease(clause 5.2) and because there was a pre-condition to the lease wherein the landlord promised to fix the damagraeto the property from a 1995 storm which happened in 1995. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to awrit of possession in possession of a section of land which was entirely covered with wild millet (a weed) but which was in good condition and tenantable repair. 3)The remaining allegations concerning the alleged breaches of the covenants by the landlords could not be determined summarily. The plaintiff had failed to respond to the allegation that one quarter of land had not been seeded and therefore is entirely covered in wild milk. 4)A writ of possess was granted to the plaintiff in accordance with Form 'C' of the Act and it would be necessary to have a trial to determine if or not Russell is entitled to possession for any of those other reasons."
3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. The application was triggered by the applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury. The parties had three children, all now adults living independently of their parents. The respondent, now retired, supported the applicant from the date of separation until 1993 when the level of support was set by a divorce judgment, at which time the support was reduced to $1,500. The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances. Although he had no employment income, the applicant was able to pursue and develop his career as an engineer because of the joint investment income available to his second wife and himself with an estimate of what portion is attributable to her. The combined current amount of his retirement income is just over $775 per month, which is well below the respondent's estimate. HELD: 1)It was evident that the applicant had retired and had no intention to become re-employed. It was essential that he know now what his future obligations were.  2)The application was dismissed with costs.  3)Each party to marriage is disadvantaged by its breakdown. In this case, being a traditional marriage, the respondent has been disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. She devoted her full time to raising their three children and raising them to be the most productive financially. She was also economically capable of earning a significant level of income. She could also supplement her own income by selling her residence and purchasing some form of annuity. Neither counsel filed any cases in support of their respective positions and confined their submissions primarily to the financial information filed. 4)The applicant was awarded costs."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.",FIAT. An application to determine the issue of costs. The defendant sought to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's second counsel was experienced and the plaintiff requested a fee of two-thirds that of the defendant's first counsel. The plaintiff was not opposed to having her second counsel testify. 2) Expert medical evidence was of significant value to the Court in this case. The court found that more was obtained than set out in the offer to settle; extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to file medical reports and the costs were proportionate to the claim advanced. 3) The defendant would not permit the plaintiff to file a medical practitioners' report without calling the doctors for cross-examination purposes. 4) Costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on interlocutory applications may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two Saskatchewan search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence, the seizure of the money (and other items) and Smith's arrest were the culmination of an investigation that had begun many months earlier. These investigations concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada including evidence allegedly implicating the accused, Smith. The investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. The Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid, then the resultant warrantless search of Smith's residence and surrounding premises was warrantless. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial by virtue of s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: 1) The evidence satisfied the court that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The warrant was valid. The only warrant that was invalid was the CDSA s. 465(1)(c) warrant. 2) The Court accepted the Crown's submission that the two search warrants as issued were invalid. However, it was unable to conclude that either warrant could not be sustained. The Court found that both the warrants had obvious and noticeable omissions and/or errors. Nor did they read properly from the standpoint of simple English. 3) There was no evidence obtained as a result of the search by the Crown of any wrong doing. 4) The affidavit evidence was excused by s. 583 of the Code. 5) An overall reading of the warrant and in particular pages and (the latter outlining, as it was intended to do, the proposed offences in respect of which the warrant authorization pertains) was inadequate and unsatisfactory to meet the minimum offence description requirements contemplated by Form S. 24 of the code as those requirements have been further interpreted and identified to apply in the Dombrowski and Alder cases, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 631. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not in these circumstances bear directly upon the validity of the Warrants, is nevertheless commented upon because of the bearing that it may have upon any s.24(1) Charter analysis that may need to be undertaken.  5) The issues to be decided as result of a voir dire are whether the warrants are valid or whether they are invalid"
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","This is an application by the accused to set aside his guilty plea to count #1, the sexual assault of his son. The Court found that the test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the application was dismissed. The Defense position is that the accused was not fully informed of the nature of the allegation, which was part of his motivation for pleading guilty, nor his understanding that he, by his plea, was admitting to that allegation. The accused's evidence regarding his awareness of the consequences of his plea to sexual assault on his son on decision of the Supreme Court Family Division regarding access to the child was not credible. The standard of proof is the civil burden. The test in R. v. R.T. (1992) cited Nevin as the correct statement of the test to be applied on this application. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. 1)The Court was not persuaded that the defence offered an innocent explanation of the plea to the behaviour of the accused in this case. 2)The accused had not seen the videotaped interview or the joint submission to be made by the Crown and myself. 3)There was no interpreter present during the sentencing. 4)The evidence was inconclusive as to the accused's knowledge of the gravity of the allegations and their effect on his ability to have contact with his son as he testified. 5)There is no evidence the accused told the accused that he wished to plead guilty, that he only wanted to show his son how to clean his penis as his father had shown him and his remorse was for the trouble brought to his family. The fact that he failed to offer an explanation for the alleged sexual assault did not change the Court's view of his knowledge and understanding of his obligation to protect his son and his right to be free of it."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The court found that a youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction in proceedings which were commenced in youth court where it is alleged that the offences occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Crown did not present any evidence of when the alleged offences occurred. The accused was found not guilty on all of the charges.  1) The evidence did not support a conviction on all the other charges. The youth judge was not prepared to assume jurisdiction on counts two and three. He was not able to determine the time of the offences when they occurred. 2) The principles set out in R. v. A. (E.A.) are applicable. The trial judge must inquire of the parties whether they wish to make a transfer application before accepting a guilty plea.  3) The jurisdiction of the youth court is determined by s. 5(1) of the Act. It does not depend on averments in the information or on proof of age. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and found that the accused could not be found guilty in any of the circumstances. 4) The Court found that if the Crown, after a complete investigation, was unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred and as a result alleges that the same offences occurred over a period of time, which includes when he was a young offender and an adult, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, the Youth Court."
d_2010skqb173.txt,"The petitioner and respondent are the parents of twins. The petitioner father sought variation of a consent order. The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed.

She then relocated to Regina to be with her family where the children were born. The respondent as single parent was able to access family supports after the twins were born in Regina. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There has not been a material change of circumstance with regard to the petitioner's increased costs as a result of the shared parenting arrangement. However, there is some evidence that the petitioner has not worked well with respect to the current terms of the parenting judgment. 2) There is no evidence that this has worked in the best interests of the children. 3) The petitioner seeks to have his child support payment as set out in the February 2007 parenting judgment be varied to provide that his $762 per month payment that he currently makes not be increased or decreased in the years to come. 4) The respondent opposes the application and says there has been no material change in the circumstances of the child. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued."
7_2001skqb10.txt,"The divorce action was based on separation for more than a year.  In issue were custody and access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)Divorce was granted. The parties, married 19 years, had been living separate and apart since January 1998. 2)They agreed to joint custody of both children. The son was to reside primarily with his father. The daughter resided with her mother. Access was essentially reciprocal on alternative weekends. The children were to be together most weekends. School vacations would be shared. 3)The father was to pay monthly child support of $485 based on his gross salary of $61,200 which included a $1500 car allowance. Expenses for music lessons, band and extracurricular school activities did not qualify as a special or extraordinary expense. The father was to contribute his proportionate share (73% to reflect spousal maintenance) of orthodontic expenses not covered by insurance. 4)Spousal maintenance of $900 was to be reviewable after December 31, 2003. The mother's job advancement was impeded as a result of the marriage, specifically by frequent moves to accommodate her husband's job transfers. She had worked out of the home for limited income to facilitate child rearing. 5)The parties agreed the matrimonial home would be sold and proceeds divided equally after payment of expenses of the sale. Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998.

The respondent was receiving income as a child of a deceased World War II veteran and had Canada Pension Plan income as the result of his father's death. The two children were healthy and active.

2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.",The court granted the divorce on the grounds of a breakdown of the marriage and the fact that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The parties agreed to joint custody of their children and that the father would pay child support of $647 per month for the child care expenses. The mother sought to vary the parenting time so that he and the child would equally share their time with the children. The father proposed that the child live with the mother every second weekend and that this would be in the children's best interest since they would have regular access every other weekend. The daughter sought to have the father make child support payments by paying a table amount in accordance with his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost in the amount of $800. HELD: The current parenting arrangements were in effect with the exception of one change regarding Remembrance Day. The parents agreed to share child care time with their children for a period of five years.  1)The father had been paying $800 per month since their separation to provide child care of the children and for the past five years the child had been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. This was reasonable and necessary and in their best interest. 2)The mother was entitled to leave her position as the primary care giver and child caretaker for the children for an extended period of time. She was also entitled to make a contribution towards child maintenance on a bi-monthly basis.  3)The court found that the expense to the mother was actually less than $800 as it did not put him in a position where he could be a parent who is sharing custody pursuant to s.16 of the Child Support Orders. Spousal support was ordered.
2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006. They have four children, all of whom are now in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2008, the parties entered a separation agreement that provided for shared parenting. Since that time, the children have been primarily resident with the respondent mother. The respondent now seeks to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the 2008 separation agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is that (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement because he is no longer in a Shared Parenting arrangement.  Corollary Relief Order granted in respect of this application pursuant to s. 15.2(1) of the Divorce Act, and s. 9(b) of that Act, which provides for a shared Parenting Agreement, and an order for child support based on the tables reflecting an income of approximately $30,000 per year. The parties' separation agreement was registered with the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in June 2009. The petitioner filed an Answer to the Petition for Divorce. It was filed September 15, 2009 and included in its supplementary material a notice of reassessment. It provided for a detailed discussion of the various aspects of the agreement, and gave an overview of the issues.  It was pertinent to note that the respondent had filed his income tax returns from 2006; 2007; and 2008. In addition, the respondent filed a separate income tax return, which was a two-page document summarizing the business income of the petitioner for the years 2005, 2006 and 2007. In it, he listed various expenses that he incurred in order to pay the respondent, who had recently become economically self-sufficient, to complete her post-secondary education, and to make all reasonable efforts to achieve that goal. He also listed some of the expenses that would be charged by the respondent if the respondent were to discontinue or resume payment of spousals in the amount of $2,000 for the duration of the probationary period. HELD: Application dismissed.  1) The Court's jurisdiction is limited by s. 17(1)(a) to determine what amount of support, if any, should be ordered based solely on the factors set out in the Act. 2) There is no evidence that the corollaries relief order will result from this hearing. 3"

On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","Paddy Lemaigre applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. There was no Charter breach. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no breach of the Charter. 2)The delay was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. The delay of three months between the first and second trial dates was considered as attributable to both parties, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend, and 3 months was sufficient delay to warrant an inquiry by Crown counsel. 3)The accused did not contribute to the delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial.  4)Discretion was taken to consider whether the prejudice to the accused in the delay was such that it outweighs the prejudice that would result if he was not to face trial."
c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity.

HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options.

HELD: 1)The husband was to pay child support for Ryan $260 per month for a period of 24 years.  2)The wife had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The husband's primary asset was his pension plan. The parties were'spenders' not'savers' and the husband was an undischarged bankrupt. 3)The only marital asset of any value is the wife's pension.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.","HELD: The court held that the petitioner’s primary residence was in Moose Jaw and that it was imminent with the decision of where Madison would attend school. The court also held that it would defer to the court to determine where she would attend her public school graduation party and whether she should seek employment elsewhere. The respondent”s parents were divorced in November 2012. During his youth, the respondent moved about Saskatchewan with his parents, brothers and sister. They resided there for several years. They were married in 2009 and had two children, ages 11 and 12. The petitioner had one child, who was now four years old. The child was normal and resilient in coping with the parent” s separation and conflict. Although the respondent had some difficulties sustaining stable adult relationships, the court found that the child was able to come out of them well-adjusted and would be better off without the assistance of the mother. The mother was competent and loving. The father of the child who had been separated from the petitioner was found to be a very good father to the child. Although he was a good father, the Court noted that the father had not shown the child that she was capable of nurturing a relationship with the child and that she had not been exposed to domestic disharmony firsthand."

Other than the fact of a chain breakage on two separate occasions, there was no evidence produced by the plaintiff, either in his affidavit or during his testimony, addressing the cause of breakage.  1) The plaintiff was not required to provide written notice to the dealer that the implement does not work well, within specified period of time. 2) The dealer or distributor are expressly entitled to an opportunity to repair or correct the deficiencies, upon receipt of notice in writing. The defendants were deprived of the opportunity to inspect and repair by the unreasonable actions of the plaintiff in his failure to allow return of the Spreaders. 3) There was no written notice given to the purchaser prior to the purchase date. If the purchaser does not have written notice, the purchaser must reject the implement. Further, if the purchaser has not taken any steps to make this decision within the next seven days, the defendant will be bound by the same claim as the plaintiff."
5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","HELD: The Court granted the application. It found the issue of disclosure only and the manner in which the documents and the information contained can be used in examination or cross-examination of the witnesses at trial was not determined. The Court also directed the Crown to provide updated criminal records for each of the accused. Counsel were to receive copies of the same documents as are being released to counsel for the accused and requested that they be given to them. The Crown also sought the services of the RCMP in respect of two Crown witnesses and in particular offences for which these two individuals had previously been convicted (2012 SKQB 543 (CanLII)). The Court found that in most cases, a useful starting point for courts in balancing the competing interests at the second stage of an O’Connor application will be to assess the true relevancy of the targeted record in the case against the defendant. Once court has ascertained upon inspection that third party records are indeed relevant to the accused’s case in the sense that they pertain to an issue in the trial, the first stage balancing exercise is easily performed. In this case, a finding of true relevance puts the third parties in the same category for disclosure purposes as the fruits of the investigation against the accused in the hands of the prosecuting Crown under Stinchcombe. The accused”s interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making a full answer and defence will, as general rule outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third party in the material. This is particularly so with respect of criminal investigation files concerning third party accused. Judicial documents were to be produced for the trial."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He did not testify as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword and where it could be purchased. 2) The Crown argues that the sword should have been found by the trial judge to be a prima facie weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which is not necessarily weapon. There is nothing to show that the knife was designed to be used as a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other jackknife; in order to open it, two hands must be used; the locking device renders the knife safer when it's used for peaceful purposes. 3) On the issue of whether the sword was a weapon within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code, one must first have regard to R. v. Graat, 1982 CanLII 33 (1982) S.C.R. 819 in accepting the accused's evidence. In examining the accused’s evidence, the judge found that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued the defendants pursuant to Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules for damages arising to them from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the Emerald Park Golf and Country Club Ltd. The plaintiffs' home was adjacent to one another and abut the ninth hole of the golf course. The defendants' golf course was designed and built in the late 1980s without any residential development adjacent to it; however, in 1997, the defendant entered an agreement with Parkview Homes to open up the land beside the Golf Course for residential development. The defendant, which operated the course for more than 10 years without approving a golf course design, brought an application for injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years. HELD: The Court ordered the defendants to pay the plaintiffs $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the next nine years and ordered a specific course of action that the defendants should take to remedy the problem.  1) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. The Court was not prepared to order the specific route of action as the matter had not yet been resolved. 2) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $6,000. 3) The defendant were ordered to pay $8,000 in damages to the plaintiffs for the damage caused from the golf balls which were hit from the adjacent golf course in the past 9 years.  4) The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed. 5) The Court refused to order an injunction to prevent the defendants from operating the 9 hole golf course until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations therein. 6) The court was unable to find a specific route to take because of the expert's report."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted in July 1997 of several offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed against their sentence. On September 16, 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from five to ten years. Throughout, the applicant was represented by senior counsel Mr. S. Halyk Q.C. The applicant decided not to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court on any of the weaker grounds and instead applied to the Court of Appeal for an extension of time to apply on one or more of the grounds raised in the proceedings. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was dismissed. 1)The prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. 2)The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the general public interest, given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the fact that the applicant had decided to leave leave in 1998 on the advice of Mr.Halyk and then on the further advice of Dean MacKinnon. Some two years later he changed his mind and applied again for leave. In September 1998 this court dismissed his conviction against conviction, and in effect increased the sentence to five to 10 years. 3)The application for Release was premature. The grounds relied upon on some of the comparatively stronger grounds were difficult to assess in their entirety and were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section 679(3)(a) which was s.6(c). 4)As a purely practical matter the applicant decided to withdraw from custody on his own accord. He then appealed the convictions, appealed against them, and then appealed against the sentence. 5)The applicant sought leave from custody to appeal on one of the more stronger grounds but his decision not to do so was based on mistaken belief that the prospective appeal had sufficient merit to satisfy clause (c)of the section. 6)The less say the better about the merit of the many grounds of appeal upon which the proceedings rest. Some are clearly destined for failure, as here are the two or three grounds upon which counsel for the applicant relied most heavily, including the issue concerning corroboration-but, even then, they do not cut to all of the convictions but only some, nor to the"

The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town applied pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act for the removal of a ground sign erected in the Town's downtown core zone. It was alleged that the by-laws restricted the respondents’ freedom of expression by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. The by-law also prohibited the use of signs in the business district, minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape. The Town contended that the By-laws were rationally connected to the objective and that the means used by the municipality to achieve its goal were reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant’s right of free expression. HELD: The application was allowed and an order of an order was issued directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents. 1)The limiting measures of the bylaw are rational and are rational. They ensure the orderly development of commercial land use while still achieving its objectives and which objectives are benefit for the community. It is not a complete prohibition of signs. It lists signs which are permitted in all zones and for which no permit is required. Primarily restrictions regulate how and where signs can be displaced and those limitations do not prevent advertising in the downtown core area. Sign restrictions for ancillary uses can be regarded as an integral part of the pressing and substantial objective of orderly city development through urban planning. Regulation of land use to ensure the health, welfare and general well-being of the inhabitants is of primary importance. 2) The limiting measures are rational as they are based on preserving and facilitating the Town’S planning goals and they are of benefit to the other citizens of the community, such as reducing the number of signs per square foot and preventing distraction to motorists. 3) There was no question that in an urban industrial society it is desirable to regulate the erection of signs both from the point of view of the safety of motorists and pedestrians and from the vantage point of maintaining the attractiveness of community. The objectives are urgent and are found to be substantial within the meaning of s. 2(b) of the Charter. The limits imposed on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss.(b) and (c)of the Charter are demonstrably justified. 4) Costs were awarded against respondents."

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year old mother was opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) Unlike the previous legislation, the requirement for bond is mandatory as indicated by the public trustee, which is why it was given a larger role to play in the new legislation and why the discretion of the court to appoint a property guardian without the need for a bond was very much restricted in the old legislation.  2) One answer is to request the Public trustee to become the property guardian pursuant to s. 30(b). The fees charged by thepublic trustee are set out in Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act and are not to be paid from time to time. 3) The public trustee should be consulted in advance of the Court application being served as well as filed as to whether there is any common ground on the type of surety that would be acceptable, including the financial disclosure required to support the same, or to determine if in the court's opinion it is appropriate to dispense with a bond in the circumstances with the result that the court is prepared to consent to the application.  4) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The defendant had stopped at an intersection for 15 seconds to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by, and then began his left turn. When the defendant turned across the path of the other vehicle, and the two vehicles came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as he was required to do so. The court found that the defendant's actions did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failure to yield the defence of due diligence was established."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Board on May 7, 2007 that the Wilcox Public School be closed effective August 15, 2007. The grounds for the application are that the Board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community council and it is alleged the election is nullity. As result there was no council for the Board to consult with as required by The Education Act, 1995. The court also notes that the respondent failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which they proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. HELD: 1) A preliminary review of the facts and law does not suggest a strong prima facie case. 2) Procedural fairness is an appropriate standard to apply in cases where the factual record is largely settled prior to the application being made. 3) The three criteria to be assessed when considering whether or not a mandatory injunction should issue are the merits of the case, whether there is a serious question to be tried, whether the Board has met its obligations under the Act, and whether the issuance of an injunction would create greater harm to the respondent."
2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT. When the 1999 judgment was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that she produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. HELD: The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether the mother had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. Counsel for Mr. Overs submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation, owned by his sister, should be disclosed as they were not kept in the respondent's home and did not have the filing information required for their examination. Whether that submission had any merit was to be heard at viva voce hearing. Neither counsel could find anything to support the assertion that the petitioner should be required to produce her father's business records or to obtain full particulars of the cattle operation in which the petitioner was engaged or the petitioner's income was being canvassed would be determined because the petitioner could not find anything of the sort which would assist the respondent in determining her entitlement to child support. Neither the petitioner nor the respondent could afford to pursue such a course.HELD: Both applications were dismissed with costs of $500 to the petitioner."
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown had refused to call any of the witnesses it had called. The accused came before the Court for preliminary inquiry on July 26, 2010. After the Crown called all of their witnesses, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the preliminary inquiry and he advised that he wished to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The Court granted the request for an adjournment so that the Defence could make arrangements to have Sergeant Barbar available for the preliminary hearing. The Court was satisfied that there was a reasonable expectation that the accused would be called as their witness. The Defence was not negligent in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The evidence adduced at preliminary inquiry does not reflect the whole of the evidence which will be presented at trial nor does it reflect the strength of the Crown's case at trial."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.",The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The only evidence was whether an in-court identification was necessary; there was no evidence that proper notice had been given of the two documents tendered by the Crown and service on a lawyer did not satisfy the notice requirement if counsel never agreed to accept service. HELD: The Court found that the accused's identity was established. The Certificate of Disqualification and Notice of Intention was designated as Exhibit P-1 for identification and letter from SGI directed to the accused was marked as Exhibit D-2 for identification. The circle of identification was complete and the person to whom the accused gave the appearance notice was the offender. The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the person named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial.
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiff corporations brought an action against the defendants for negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. The defendants claimed liability insurance for the loss of nine of the 11 crew members who died when their helicopter collided with the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff sought to have the defendants answer questions as to when airfare tickets were reserved, the cost of such tickets, and the date of their use were to be disclosed. The defendant refused to answer whether liability insurance was obtained through KOC or Cameco. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1)The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind any questioning with respect to these issues is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is or could be logically relevant to a fact or position in issue. In any event the report of the safety officer at the main camp site is not privileged because he was requested to prepare a safety report prior to the accident but did not get around to it until after the accident. 2)A detailed perusal of documents will suggest the possibility of these theories. The only issue is whether the predominant purpose of all such memoranda and expert reports was contemplated litigation as opposed to the prevention of another similar accident in the future. 3)A number of documents relating to the availability of alternative forms of transportation were not properly identified. The claimed privilege is too broad and prevents him from ascertaining the names of potential witnesses, which may result in him being taken by surprise at trial. Questions related to the e-mail system are properly answerable.  4)The plaintiffs were awarded leave to reapply for direction.  5)The Saskatchewan Evidence Act defines'record' as any information that is recorded or stored by means of any device, including a computer. 6)The report of Mr. Eric Rast who was safety officer was not privileged for the simple reason that until such a date is known it cannot be known whether such records are in existence during the relevant period of time. 7)The plaintiff was entitled to seek further direction on this issue."

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","Two applications before the Court under the Family Maintenance Act s.10 seeking an order providing for the relief of varying the child maintenance payable pursuant to the 1993 order by reducing the maintenance payable from $250 per month for each of the three children to the amounts specified under the Federal Child Support Guidelines as adopted by the Act; cancelling the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and varying access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the children. HELD: 1) The respondent was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order. The principles of law governing child support for infant children are well-known and specifically provided in The Guidelines and The Act. 2) Both parties are restrained from removing the children from the Province of Saskatchewan without the written consent of the other party or an order of this Court. With respect to the first issue, the Court was not prepared to hear her application and advised her to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. 3) On the second issue the court was satisfied that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 3:00 pm on Sunday and two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 4) The petitioner did not proceed by way of notice motion nor did she filed appropriate affidavit evidence in support of her application.

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","An application for judicial review of a labour arbitrator's decision that the wording of collective agreement was wide enough to encompass the situation. The court found that the arbitrator’s decision was patently unreasonable. It was not reasonable to assume that anyone with more departmental seniority would benefit from the reduction in work hours because another employee with greater departmental strength returned from maternity leave. The arbitrator found that this was not a lay-off situation. Rather, an indefinite reduction of hours occurred, not by reason of Ms. MacMaster leaving her position but by scheduling related events and promotions. The appellant was the first to experience a reduction in her work hours. She subsequently filed a grievance alleging that the reduction was caused by personnel change. She sought allotment of work hours based on her hotel seniority and recovery of her loss of wages. She also alleged that the delay in her leave had resulted in a reduction of the number of hours available for work in the front desk department by virtue of her being the first one to experience such a reduction. She argued that the exclusion of overtime, promotions, overtime and vacation allocation were dealt with by way of departmental levelity and the reduction of overall hours within the department was due to personnel change rather than from a layoff. She alleged that Article 9:01 can reasonably be given an interpretation that has the potential to detrimentally affect employees returning to maternity leave, depending on their standing of seniority. The appeal was allowed on the basis that the interpretation of the arbitration arbitrator was not patently reasonable and was not inconsistent with the presumed intention of the parties."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. The respondent was acquitted of the charge. In this appeal the Crown argues that the trial judge did not consider that the appellant's speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in all the circumstances. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the dangerous driving. 3) The Court was not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He went beyond merely considering whether the appellant was in a construction zone and accepted as fact that there were no construction workers or equipment in the area."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","Three motions were brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188. The motions sought an order pursuant to the Rules of the Public Officers' Protection Act and an extension of a limitation period nunc pro tunc. With the consent of the plaintiff, the Court ordered that the action against the Attorney General be dismissed. The remaining substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether the limitation period should be extended, and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action. HELD: The applications were dismissed with costs under double Column V and the other issues were set aside. 1)The limitation period did not commence to run until after the expiration of the 1 year limitation period. The limitation period was not extended. 2)The Court was of the view that it was improper to dismiss the claim simply because it was a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. 3)Limitation of actions were substantive in character as opposed to procedural. Section 579(2) of the Code allows the Crown to recommence criminal prosecution during a period of 1 year from the date the stay is entered without the necessity of laying new Information or preferring a new indictment. 4)The limitations period was extended by a factor of 1 years. 5)Limitations on action relating to breaches of duty, breaches of duties, misrepresentation and other causes of action were not limited to events prior to the entering of a stay of proceedings by the Crown. 6)Statutes of fact are not to be confused with statements of facts. The Act does not alter the substantive rights of the parties to proceed pro rata."
b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is debt 'accruing due' under s. 5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. Here, the conditional nature of the debt under the GIC was not a conditional one and therefore not garnishable."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original custody judgment, which provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.

As the mother demonstrated that it was not, a fresh inquiry is embarked upon. 3) The Court would have been amenable to an application for sole custody to the mother with scheduled access if the mother had it been requested. There would be no disruption to the child consequent on removal from family, schools and the community he or she had come to know."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order quashing two orders of the Board made pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing them. The orders required Wal-Mart to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The order also required that the company comply with the discovery and production of documents sought by the union. The applicant objected to the subpoenas and sought the production of additional documents. The respondent denied having the authority to subpoena or make the disclosure and production orders but maintained that it had the jurisdiction to do indirectly what it could do directly. Wal- Mart Canada declined to comment on the offending provisions. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. Counsel for the Board conceded that two exceptions were made to the general rule that error of law must appear on the face of the record. The third exception was that the Board did not have jurisdiction to authorize the plaintiff to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts that it was not without jurisdiction. The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning in R. v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal.  1) It is not in dispute that the board has adopted pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and Functional analysis. 2) There are virtually no reasons given by the Board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW or to make production orders without considering the relevance of what is sought to be produced. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review the relevancy or privilege of the affidavit evidence. 3) The portions would normally have been struck. 4) The application is adjourned to June 10, 2004 and continued on June 11, 2004. The hearing was adjourned for a further time. 5) The issues on appeal are summarized in the amended notice of motion and detailed legal brief filed by the parties. They ask that the Court consider whether the issue should be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal or whether it is protected by s. 1, s. 2(d) of the Charter. They seek to attach the respondent's s. 9 Charter rights to the record and to compel the applicant to comply with certain of the provisions of the subpoena.

b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The deceased sales agent, who had been with the defendant since 1965, was terminated as a sales agent with the result that the defendant, in a program it invited its agents to participate in, reduced the level of compensation on new policies written by the plaintiff and required him to accept the new compensation. For the deceased, that this was a month in arrears in respect to his pay. The non-competition clause in the defendant's compensation agreement provided for monthly compensation based on the 'book of repeat clients' as well as renewal compensation calculated in accordance with the average renewals for the prior month. The deceased's position was no longer available. The court rejected the deceased's submission that he did not pursue the possibility of alternative employment with enthusiasm or commitment, as he had prepared neither a resume nor sought a recommendation from his former employer in order to assist him in such a pursuit. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that since the deceased had made little effort to secure alternative employment, he was not entitled to the benefit that he would have otherwise received in the first place, and that his current position was not available. Awarding the deceased 20 months salary as damages in lieu of $3,000, that the deceased did not make any effort to seek alternative employment."
4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","The parties were married for approximately thirty years. They had two children, ages 18 and 18. The wife requested an equal time shared parenting arrangement with the children every second weekend. The husband objected that the wife was abusive of the children. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the spouses were unable to communicate effectively with each other and the children did not have access to the other parent's information. HELD: The court found that both parties were unable, at this stage in their relationship, to meet the basic requirements for successful shared parenting. While shared parenting is appropriate, it does not necessarily mean joint custody is in the child's best interest. Both parties have demonstrated a depressing lack of cooperation. This has resulted in the vitiation of virtually all direct communication between them. They do not meet face to face and do not talk on the phone. Their e-mails are curt at best. They use their children as messengers."

The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearings pending a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts wereposed of.

Thedisclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was notgoing to result in any new facts that were not already known to it. 2)The Commission was not relying on conviction. It will have the onus of adducing evidence related to the alleged breaches of s. 112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and presumably the defence will consist of denying one or more of the elements implicit in the allegations. 3)When an application such as this is brought, the Onus is on the applicant to show a degree of prejudice if the civil proceedings are not stayed. 4)The prejudice must exist after taking into account that evidence to be given by the party in a civil examination for discovery or trial has available the protection offered by the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 (s. 5(2)) and The Saskatchewan Evidence Act. It would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and determination of guilt on same facts and information before the Provincial Court.  5)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commissionhearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the appellant had not suffered a miscarriage of justice as a result of his non-lawyer agent’s ineffective assistance in the conduct of the trial. The matter was remitted to a jury to determine whether the appellant should have taken the position that he was entitled to representation by his lawyer on the basis that his in-laws had provided him with ineffective assistance. The fresh evidence was not directed to a factual issue decided by the trial judge but rather to obtaining an original remedy from this Court on the ground that the agent”s ineffectual assistance resulted in a miscarriageof justice. The law in this area is well established and there is little reason to embark on further analysis of the factors that might have led to the conclusion that the accused had not been entitled to fair representation.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was pursuing a shoplifter, was run down in a cross walk in a mall parking lot by the van that was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist. The plaintiff had insurance from his employer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. When he returned to live in the mall, he sought to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. His unsuccessful attempt was refused because the public record still showed he was the registered owner of the vehicle that had been involved in the hit and run incident. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. The Court was unable to locate either of them.  1) The plaintiff acknowledged that he sold the van to a woman he had just picked up and wanted to exchange for drugs. He said he did not recall the date of the sale but that he recognized it by the distinguishing features earlier mentioned and promptly called the police to pass on its location and license number. 2) The only clear evidence before the court on the identity of the van is that of the plaintiff himself. His claim that the van was sold to the woman who supplied the drugs was rejected by his lawyer. He retained a lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration which he said he would present to the Court on December 7, 2000. It was this document that led the Court to conclude that the defendant had sold the vehicle to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had no record of the transaction. It is pertinent to note that this statement was signed by the defendant, who is a 12 year old and lives in Dartmouth and has a residence there. He was in Dartmouth when the incident occurred. He did not recognize the defendant from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file but he recognized him from the driver's license plate when he was alerted to the squeal of tires. The defendant was arrested and taken to the police station where he was charged with several offences under the Motor Vehicle Act. He also testified that he only stayed 5 to 10 minutes in the security office with the police during which time he took a five-minute standing ovation and then took a second look at the van once he was led to the court office. He stated that he was not satisfied with the defendant's version of events, but was satisfied that he had a valid and reliable explanation for the events leading up to the commission of the offence.  2) There"

HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with possession and use of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession and sale of marijuana in the presence of a person over the age of 21.

All evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded.  1) Even the s. 7 Charter argument refers only to a count in the indictment. The police officers cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of activity, whether criminal or otherwise, that could be observed by any vigilant member of the public. 2) Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. Such sensing of emissions, aromas or odours and drawing sensible conclusions from their detection is entirely reasonable when considering whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. 3) The evidence established that the strong odour of raw cannabis in the accused's vehicle combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both."

This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists.

b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused is charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The Court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to the Summary Offences Procedure Act. The arrest was lawful. The Court makes the following finding of the facts: [1] The Crown has proved beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt (C.P.A.'s s. 52(2) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, states that 'no person shall be in an intoxicated condition in a public place or permitted premises' (S. 143 of the same Act) and may arrest without warrant any person whom he finds committing an offence under the Act.

When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant appealed her conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility.

The court found no error in his conclusion that the appellant's culpability for the robbery and the assault had been established beyond reasonable doubt.[1] The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that at the time of this offence she was on parole. She knew that if she were convicted, her parole would be revoked.

The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.",The plaintiffs brought a motion to consolidate their claim against the defendants with three other named actions. All four defendants were originally seeking consolidation of an action involving the same defendants and allegations of negligent management with each plaintiff during an overlapping period of time. The motion was dismissed with the exception that the matters be heard together (pursuant to Rule 37.02 of the Rules) because there was little evidence available to assess the degree of overlap in the evidence to be adduced on behalf of each plaintiff.  There was also no evidence before the Court to determine whether the proposed trials should be heard individually or in sequence.

Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant.

The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992 and Regulations made thereunder.

The Municipality appealed. The Board dismissed the Director's motion holding that it did have jurisdiction. The appeal was dismissed with costs to each of the respondents in the amount of $500 plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007, entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damage for unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The plaintiff has always made his payments to the defendant and it has been in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times. There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. The Limitations Act allows an action to be commenced within 2 years of the claim being discovered. This claim was discovered prior to 2007 and therefore the Plaintiff had until October 2009 to commence his action. His action was not commenced until January 2010. There was no evidence that there was any service contract between the parties and the plaintiff was not satisfied with the equipment. The Plaintiff signed the agreement with Irwin indicating that they were satisfied with that equipment and have had two and one half years with it to inspect it or have someone else look at it to establish if anything was wrong with it. There were no service contracts entered into between the plaintiff and the defendant prior to that date. The only agreement that the parties had was to supply the equipment and install it. The court found that the defendant completed his part of the transaction and installed the equipment, and as far as he was aware, the Plaintiff was satisfied. The Court found no material representation and no fraud. The claim was statute-barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007 and there was never any written agreement between the two parties and no service contract was ever entered between the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The defendants were negligent in failing to ensure that equipment was working for the purposes for which it was intended. The plaintiffs sued because they signed a service contract that was outside the parameters of the original agreement and were unable to reach a mutually acceptable compromise. Once a potential plaintiff has a claim against a corporation for services, it is presumed that the corporation will pay the plaintiff in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Once the plaintiff becomes aware of its existence, the claim is barred and the proceeding shall not be maintained.

d_2007skqb406.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs are former students of a school at Ile a La Crosse, Saskatchewan. They commenced this proposed class action against the Attorney General of Canada (the Government) in December 2005. In January 2007 the plaintiffs' counsel filed an amended statement of claim which added the Government of Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan) as a second defendant. Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim. However, s. 20 does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Section 19 of The Limitations Act applies to the original and the amended claims. The application is dismissed. 2) Accepting the pleadings as true, a number of the plaintiffs' claims are prima facie statute-barred. The plaintiff may choose to apply for orders determining that no time limitation period applies or allowing the claims to be brought. Alternatively, the defendants may apply for orders determining that some or all of the claims are statute-barred. In either case, the applications must satisfy the applicable legislation and the Rules of Court.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that a number of the plaintiffs’ claims were prima facie statute-barred. They argued that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applied because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant. Saskatchewan’s application for an order disallowing the amendments was not supported by the pleadings or by relevant evidence. A number of issues were raised in argument but not placed before the Court in form and substance that could fairly be considered and decided. The pleadings indicated that the plaintiffs were alive to the possibility of some of their claims being statute barred. They asked the court to extend the time for commencing the action on a nunc pro tunc basis.
6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The petitioner manufactures log-home packages near Weyakwin, under the direction of Garry Varga, the sole director of the company. As a result of what the manufacture of these packages entails, both the company and Varga were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996. In consequence, each was fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. The Attorney General applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for leave to appeal on the grounds the judge misconstrued the licensing provisions of the Act and hence misapplied them. HELD: Appeal allowed. The convictions must stand. The matter need not have been taken up in the context of this case, at least not in the extent and to the effect the judge thought appropriate. The fines and surcharges are nothing in the case to suggest we might interfere with the decision of the trial judge, so they must stand too."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Director's application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. The vehicle in question is a 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van. The Director purchased it in 2010 with money received from her father's estate. Beginning in January of 2013, she and the respondent used it to haul items on an on-call basis. In March of 2012, the accused entered the compound through a hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. As a witness approached the scene, witnesses called out warning to the accused. The accused and the vehicle's owner, the respondent, were in the vehicle for approximately nine months. When the driver threatened to call the police, the parties hid the vehicle in a nearby fenced compound and entered the vehicle with two large pails of copper wired. As the accused and driver argued that they were forced to forfeit their vehicle and livelihood as a consequence of three ineptly carried out efforts to steal copper material, the Chambers judge dismissed the application. He noted that, in all the circumstances of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the Court. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making process. He was also at pains to underline the exceptional nature of his power to deny a forfeiture application. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1) With respect to issues (a) and (b) of the proposed appeal, not at all sure that the judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime, and so forth. His characterization of the accused's evidence as having been made on information and belief did not serve to give primacy to these interests and, in particular, failing to consider that the accused had been sentenced to 12 months of probation and 80 hours of community service and taking into account the fact they had been held by the Director for 90 days.  2) The test for granting leave to appeal is well known. It involves a consideration of both the merits and the importance of an appeal. The Court is not persuaded that the Court's characterization is appropriate in this case.  3) The Director's s. 3(1) decision was not of particular importance to the Court given the nature of the appeal"

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"An application under Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for income replacement benefits contending that the accident caused the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the claim. The applicant applied to the respondent for review of its decision and appealed to the Court pursuant to s. 197. HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no doubt that for a period of time after the disc hersiation, the non-earner was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities. His appeal is dismissed."
d_2017skpc77.txt,"HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge. Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood while awaiting a sample of the ASD test. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count 1. The observation period was not conducted properly. The police officer did not observe the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. The breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. The accused did not attempt to call counsel at the roadside. The officer's notes do not provide any other reasons for the stop. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By does not stand for the proposition that an accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights must be implemented at roadside during the screening techniques in every instance. There is sufficient factual similarity between By and this case that it cannot be distinguished on the facts. In both cases the police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussed on the accused and his right to counsel was breached. The Police Officer was actually absent for a period of time from the accused's presence."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","The plaintiff gave birth to a healthy baby girl on August 25, 1992. She was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginalbleeding. The defendant performed a caesarian section to contain the bleeding and stabilized the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that the hysterectomy was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hemorrhage became inevitable. Central to the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant was that the likely cause of the ongoing or recurring bleeding was the retained products of conception which the surgeon failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded damages for irretrievable loss and for the pain and suffering resulting from her treatment and surgery.  1)The Court found that the surgical procedures performed on the plaintiff were realistic and reasonable in that they prevented the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysticomy. 2)The surgical procedures were straightforward and methodical. The only thing that could be expected of a surgical procedure was a detailed description of the procedures performed. 3)No medical evidence was given as a prima facie proof of the facts stated in Ares v. Venner, which held that if a doctor faced with a post-partum hemorrhage problem would, given that the most common cause of such a hemorrhage is retained products, then his diagnosis and treatment should be proper and reasonable."
d_2002skpc138.txt,"The accused was charged with failure to comply with a demand to provide a breath sample contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The accused, a 28 year member of the RCMP, failed to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood. HELD: The accused was convicted of failure to provide a sample. The Court found that the accused was not diligent in attempting to obtain counsel as he was not aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks and that his breathing was erratic. The accused did not communicate the contents of the message on the answering machine to the police officer thus not allowing the officer to consider a longer waiting period than the 10 minutes he did allow."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preservingand detaining all future production proceeds from those properties. The defendants filed affidavits in support of the application. They argued that they would suffer irreparable harm if the order was not granted because the proceeds would cease to exist and the properties would become worthless. They sought to attach the words 'all outstanding debts, claims or damages' to the builders' liens. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that although the applicants had not met the first test, they had shown a strong probability that grave damage would accrue to the plaintiffs' property and that there was a distinct possibility that the preservation order issue would force the defendant to take appropriate steps to recover the funds necessary to maintain the properties.  1)The applicants failed to meet the second test which must be met in order for a mandatory injunction to be granted. 2)The court must be careful to see that the defendant knows exactly what he has to do and this test goes much further than the 'prima facie', or strong prima facie, case that must be proven in negative injunction application. 3)The Court was not able to say that the applicants' application was sufficient to satisfy the test set out in Cupar, but it was possible to speculate that they might be joined by other lienholders who had not joined the applicants in the actions. 4)The plaintiff did not meet the third test, which was whether the applicants would be required to pay full compensation before the order sought was issued. The Court was of the view that it did not have the means to do so."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while his ability to do so was impaired (under s. 253(1)(a)) and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08. The accused offered a 'last drink' defence, that alcohol he drank just before driving was not yet in his blood stream when he was stopped by the officer, but was at the time his breath tests were taken at the detachment. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on the impaired driving charge and on the over.08 charge. The court accepted the accused's evidence that he was not trying to evade the police officer and accepted the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick. The Court was not satisfied that the accused attempted to get away from the officer when he turned on his emergency lights, because he was afraid of the legal consequences that could befall him at that point. The evidence of the last drink was different in terms of both the amount of beer and hard liquor consumed and the time the hard liquor was consumed than the one given to the accused. The defence called alcohol expert Mary Ellen Scott and claimed the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before driving and that this factor, taken together with the time since this day, effected his recollection of what he drank that day and night."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.",The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The police observed the transaction from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from a position of some elevation. Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter. The accused denied having stashed the drugs in the rock wall. HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused stashed these drugs in a rock wall after the transaction and that he did so minutes before his arrest. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine constituted enough cocaine to supply the accused with his next transaction. It was also concluded that the gesturing to another place for the deal to take place was common practice in street level drug trafficking.
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss. 253 (1)(b) of the Code. The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. As there was no error, the trial judge was not prepared to set aside his decision. 2) On the first stage the accused was provided an opportunity to be informed of his rights and obligations under the law and, most importantly, to obtain advice on how to exercise those rights and fulfil those obligations. 3) The officer did not turn to the accused in an attempt to reduce the number of names. There really was no similarity between the name 'Vaughn' and the one that was noticed in the name of a relative who was known to him. There was no other observable sign of impairment. It was most likely that some physical impediment caused the accused to make mistake. 4) When the computer search was negative, the matter was abandoned and a computer search of that name was unsuccessful. The accused stated that he had consumed four or five drinks. He was alert, quiet and polite. His speech was not slurred. 5) It is not an issue that the accused invoked his right to counsel. The first stage of the investigation was to check the driver's licence, the vehicle registration and sobriety. The second stage was to exclude the results of the analysis of breath samples. The court took comfort in the fact that, on balance, it was not the officer's attitude that constituted indifference to the Charter test that constituted a breach of his or her Charter rights."
9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property applies for an order of vacate and demolish to allow him to remedy his problems with the building. The building inspector at the time of issuing the demolition order had not received complete disclosure of the case he had to meet as the earlier complaints had not led to the order. The inspector now seeks leave from the Court to launch an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act. The board has complied with the direction of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure has been made to the applicant regarding relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The board's order is confirmed. It is not appropriate to restrict either party in putting forward evidence which they consider relevant on these questions. 2) There is no error of law. The Board acted in a reasonable and prudent manner in confirming the November 2004 demolition order. 3) It would be appropriate to have the applicant apply to the court for a period of time to bring forth his written proposal as outlined in the board's decision. In this sense, the board has ensured that the applicant knew the case they had to attend to and that it was able to remedy the underlying problems by permitting the applicant to bring forward his proposal."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 of property to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. The Director’s evidence consisted of three affidavits filed by the respondents. The majority (93%) of cash seized was in $20 denominations and the evidence of the respondent was based on the expiration of a limitation period. The remainder of cash was in denominations of $1,000 to $2,500. The respondents’ affidavits were based on information provided by the respondent that the respondent had purchased a truck from him in 2007. The respondent claimed the vehicle was never registered in any of the names of the individuals present at the time of the search. At para of his affidavit, he said: 8. THAT Mr. Metz had been paying the respondent back for the money that lent him the truck and do not know why Mr. Calfas would suggest that the vehicles were never registered IN any of our names. 9. That the respondent swore an affidavit in support of the Director.  10. That he was aware of the property when it was seized from Butler and the fact that the property was in such good standing with the Saskatchewan Police Service and that he lent the money to the respondent for the purchase of the truck was not in any way inconsistent with that of the individual charged with the criminal offence as opposed to the property derived from unlawful activity.  11. That there was no retroactivity issue to be tried in this Court because the statute was enacted prior to the coming into force and the legislation was not made expressly retroactive."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. dated March 6, 1996. In his last full year with Ipsco, being the 2000 taxation year, the father's gross annual income was the sum of $52,377. HELD: 1) The father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It has been said in number of cases that individuals who are subject to support obligations are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to all the circumstances. The court has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding. 2) On all of the evidence the father has indicated that he is underemployed, must determine the amount of income to be imputed to the respondent. The primary question is, what are the appropriate s. Guideline expenses for the child and how should these expenses be shared by the father and Ms. Lilley?  3) The mother has requested costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  4) Costs are awarded to the mother in the amount amount of $750. The mother's application for further disclosure was before the Court on September 10, 2003 and made an order allowing her to cross-examine the father on the affidavits and financial statements."

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the labour Relations Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. 1)Section 5.3 both confers and limits the jurisdiction of the Board to make interim orders. The question decided by the Board, that it had power to makes the order in question, was clearly a jurisdictional question and so treated it. Accordingly the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than whether it was patently unreasonable. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power: the existence of an application or complaint before the board, andthe existence of power in the labour board to make final order in respect of the application. 2)S.25(1) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. Nor is there anything in s.25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the the board in the conduct of the arbitration process."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the accused in Queen v. Jessome. The Defence had attempted to co-operate with the Crown in setting dates and co-operated to the extent that they apparently fumbled on one of the subpoenas. The judge granted the adjournment. The applicant, who had been tried in Provincial Court but plead not guilty, applied to have the order of the judge struck because it was in the nature of an adjournment order and he had not been privy to the information which had been provided to him by counsel.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following a trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and division of matrimonial property, a division of the property was held. At issue was whether the husband should resume livestock operation on the farm and whether it was a viable operation. HELD: 1)The wife was entitled to the following set-off: $800 for February and $1,100 for March, April and May for a total of $4,100.  2)The respondent's claim for set-offs was allowed since he did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy a substantial amount of the farm assets were still to be dealt with. 3)The petitioner paid $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of the previous order prohibiting the sale of any assets without consent of the other party or the Court. 4)Division of property was based on asset values at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. 5)When all of the assets were liquidated and it was determined what amount was actually available for division the wife was awarded 56% of the net proceeds to the respondent and 44% to the wife. 6)Each side was to bear their own costs."

The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action on the grounds that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation which wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which was related to thesubject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or No assets in the province.

c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed, with costs as usual, and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given via registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as it did to be applied by local people with no special training, except for the administrators. 2)There was no prejudice in the way the legislature decided to interpret the provisions of s. 303(1) of the Act. The legislature did not expressly provide for the effect of imperfect compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the subsection nor did any other form of prejudice arise. Rather, it intended to use the word give as importing the necessity of receipt. This would add a desirable measure of bureaucratic certainty to the appeal process. Notice of appeal could then be acted upon only if received before the 20 day period expires, not otherwise, not even if received in sufficient time to enable the board to meet the appeal in keeping with the taxing scheme of the enactment.  3)The word give is importing the necessary of receipt, just as the Committee did. In the circumstances, this amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort, which amounts to a reasonable degree of compliance. In this case, the phrase may give notice by mail (ie. fax) could not be taken to mean in sufficient compliance therewith. 4)The appeal could only be entertained if the notice did not arrive within 20 days of the mailing or delivery of the notice. This was especially true in the circumstances for the assessment had not been completed well in advance of May 31st. 5)The delay in hearing and determining the appeal had nothing to do with the delay but with the fact that the notice had been sent but not received within the prescribed period.  6)The legislature intended nothing short of fatal."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.

The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving.

The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

The respondent applied to the court for an order of prohibition. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the Court, whether composed of a judge and jury or a jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial will be declared. 2)The respondent said that she had not read the record. If inadvertent errors should automatically result in termination of the proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate, errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. In her view, the accused's rights as guaranteed by the Charter are not violated when the inadvertent error occurs."

The defendant is responsible for all incurred costs due to trucking and transporting the cows.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as a result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit. The plaintiff alleges that the road condition was icy on the exit ramp leading up to the bridge and the City had not taken steps to address the icy road surfaces. To refuse the application under s. of The Contributory negligence would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence.HELD: The application is granted as requested. 1)It is incumbent upon the Chambers judge to ascertain whether the defendant, Rocy (applicant), has filed material which establishes a prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiffs if the third party claim was to go forward as proposed.  2)The Court reviewed the pleadings and pleadings of the plaintiff and found that the defendant was a major player in undertaking the work which is the subject of the plaintiffs loss and claim. 3)The issue of prejudice could be addressed through direction and order from the Court on the combined process as an alternative.  4)The application is purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties can be determined on it.

He spent 13 days on remand and approximately 2 months under strict parental control on house arrest prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)In addition to the large number of theft offences, the accused used a stolen vehicle in a high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. 2)The Youth Court judge counted the time J.M. spent under house arrest as secure custody. 3)The accused made great change during the course of this period.

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The main issue relates to how the proceeds of sale of property by judicial listing should be applied against a mortgage balance when there are both purchase money and non-purchase money balances. The appellant relies upon the Court's decision in Andrew (CA) and the clear direction that the sale proceeds be applied to the purchase money portion. The respondent then seeks an order entitling it to the deficiency. Hrynewich Holdings respects the spirit and intent of the LCRA and accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. However, it was not intended to give the mortgagor immunity from liability for the portion of the indebtedness that was not purchase money funds and nothing in the section requires the mortgagee to treat its security as securing pro-rated amounts of the purchase, purchase, and purchase money portions of the debt. The appeal will deal with each issue in turn. A) the appeal is allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment; the respondent is entitled to take out the deficiency against the mortgage balance. B) the conclusion in CA would not have been made had it not been for the court's intervention and the legislature's intervention to stem this tide and prevent further disaster at the hands of aggressive financial institutions and creditors.  C) the decision of the Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Land Contracts (Actions) Act and held that the amount owed to the respondent should be $162,675.72. The purchase money debt balance is decreased to $132,582.48 and is protected by s. III of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The remaining LCRA protection is $31,160.23. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) The Court was able to bring the matter to Queen’s Bench and it would have been appropriate had the matter been allowed to this extent. 2) In the interest of fairness the court found that the respondent was entitled to apply the realized security proceeds to the balance owing of the mortgage. The portion owed by the appellants was 64.03% ($60,000, $70,000 and $87,711.48) and was the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision.  2) The court reviewed the various decisions of the previous court and found that in the absence of a provision, neutral approach involves allocation of the payment on a pro rata"

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses it suffered due to delays in the construction of the LBC on the basis that the equipment supplied by the defendant was not the same type and model as it listed in the response to the tender. The parties agreed to delay commencement of the contract until July on the defendant's assurance that he would be able to have the necessary equipment on site by that time. The plaintiff was awarded the contract with an order for $45,000.00. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tender and the 1985 invitation for tenders is inconsequential. The court found that in the case the wording was different, the plaintiff's responsibilities were not as extensive as they would have been if the tender had been used, and that the plaintiff had confirmed in writing the purchase order as being the contract between the parties."

There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the father's access supervised. The father had stopped living with the child since January 2010 because of his family ties in Egypt and Kuwait and because of the child's allergy to nuts and nut products. The mother worried that the father would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for the child and because she was concerned that the child would be in danger of physical harm if she were left in the care of the father. The parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between the father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. The Mother was the primary care parent.HELD: 1) The evidence from the parties was inconclusive as to whether the father knew what he was doing or did not know. 2) The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be better prepared to parent the child. 3) There must be evidence to suggest there is a real likelihood that the parent making the threat has the child in his care. The evidence did not suggest that he fully understood how to properly care for a year old child.

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata.

The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.

It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: Royal Bank of Canada applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: 1) Royal Bank is entitled to solicitor‑client costs in the amount of $4,500.  2) It is pertinent to note that RBC is also entitled to assess the pro- rata calculation for the non‑purchase portion of its mortgage, that is, 8% of the total costs incurred by the defendant. In this case, the pro forma calculation of the non – purchase money mortgage is 8%. The Court of Appeal in Walker was not required to address the prorating of solicitor costs because the parties had consented to having the matter remitted to the Queen's Bench judge. However, Walker is instructive in explaining the policy objective of s.8 of the LCRA. The protection of the s.4 LCRA continues to apply to only that component of the mortgage loan that was given to secure the purchase price of the land. It logically follows that the protection under s.7 of the Non-Purchase Money Mortgage is only applicable to those costs which are part of the overall outstanding mortgage amount. The pro-rate calculation is adjusted to include condominium fees and their associated fees and the property management charges. 3) The defendant was entitled to judgment against Partridge for 8%of the solicitor costs, condominium fee and property management fees. 4) RBC was granted judgment for principal and interest owed under the Mortgage.

The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of Constable Power, who was charged and convicted in the Provincial Court of committing an assault causing bodily harm, pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding that the appellant had used more force than was necessary to either defend himself under s. 34(1) or effect the arrest of Mr. Stonechild (appeal decision). The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to S. 839 of the Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was entered in the provincial court. The conviction was set aside and the Crown was reinstated. 1) The trial judge made no errors in law. He transformed the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry into a purely objective test. He should have inquired whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of reasonable grounds for that subjective belief or, put another way, whether there was any doubt that a reasonable person in the position of the appellant might be expected to employ that option. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary, then the Court must be open to him to consider the timing of the events.

The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

The court found that the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal listed in the notice of appeal are that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ply beam, notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete Grade beam was not established at trial. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) It is not the role of an appellate court to second guess the weight to be assigned to the various items of evidence. If there is no palpable and overriding error with respect to the underlying facts, such as the nature of the foundation's problems, then it is only where the inference-drawing process itself is palpably in error that an appellate Court can interfere with the factual conclusion. 2) This was a small claims proceeding and that Hancock was self-represented. There was no palpable or overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. 3) The trial judges were in a privileged position as trier of fact because they have the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses. This is not a case such as that referred to in R. v. Lensen, where evidence of a special form of injury known as post-concussive syndrome was found to be beyond the expertise of a general surgeon even though he had some additional courses in trauma and orthopaedic surgery."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was correct to find that the evidence did not yield up any reasonable inferences. 2)There was sufficient evidence for him to reach conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found at the southeast corner of the Enjoy Gardens building and next to the 7-Eleven store where the complainant went for help after he suffered the injuries. Shortly before the victim went into the store, three persons saw the victim and the appellants at the same spot. This is one of the worst beatings that I've seen in recent times. In either case the 'other inculpatory evidence' of motive and hostility, when other reasonable explanations existed, put the present case into the category of one where'something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice'. 3)The court relied on s.651(3) of the Code which provides: 651(2) where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or he is entitled to address the jury last, but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled by virtue of their entitlement to present argument to judge sitting without a jury. In this case the Crown failed to prove that an assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed."

The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The wife was the primary caregiver for the children, to perform the major part of the homemaking chores and to supplement the family finances by employment. She also sought some amount of funds to defray costs of tuition and retraining. The husband sought to have a bank loan collateral mortgage removed from the matrimonial residence where the wife would continue to occupy with the children. The parties had met at the start of their university education and were married for approximately three years. After that, they began a period of cohabitation. The wife was an active athlete and intended a career in physical education, but feared that retirement would force her to leave her position as a professional in the field of physical education. She turned over some $15,000 in inheritance and other personal funds that she received during the marriage to the common marriage fund. She sought an order specifying terms and conditions of the business loan, including an interest rate or return on investment. HELD: 1)The Court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the petition for divorce. There was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2)The court found that the 'needs and means' test is not the exclusive basis for determining spousal support under the 1985 Divorce Act. 3)The trial judge must utilize great ingenuity in determining the reasonable standard of living to which the wife is entitled and in deciding what factors should be included in reaching this conclusion. The Court reviewed the various authorities set out in Moge and found that Moge failed to do so. 4)The judge must strike a balance between the position of temporal limit on maintenance to encourage the acquisition of self-sufficiency and the allowance of unlimited maintenance to cover the shortfall in the spouse's employability. It is in situations such as this that the trial judge has to determine the practicability of obtaining economic self‑sufficiency under s.15 of the Divorce act and whether time limitation should be used to encourage that status."

HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.

HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order reinstating him as a student at the college of medicine pending resolution of his appeal.  1) The applicant has a marginal academic record. Take judicial notice of the fact that the University has a limited number of placements within its Collegeof Medicine and that the training of a physician is lengthy and expensive process vis-à-vis the University. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Bylaw Committee has such power. In fact, if the power existed in the Board of Regents it would not operate as a vetting step and of course no need for the establishment of an appeal board. There is a limit on the Board's jurisdiction to determine whether an appeal will be heard. In ordinary circumstances, upon finding a breach of natural justice on the basis of denial to be heard, the court would quash that decision and order the matter be heard according to law. 3) It is not appropriate however for the Board to usurp the function of the Committee and review the material to determine if in opinion, the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3.

The defence argued that the complainant was under 14 years and no issue of consent arose. The appellant did not testify and the complainant described how he had in fact had intercourse with her under circumstances that would suggest it could well have been expected to take place.
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The children reside with the respondent and the respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. It appears the respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children. HELD: The application to vary child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of the Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes a material change. For voluntary change to be material, it must be reasonable in the circumstances. The respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his support obligation. His decision was ill-conceived. It is apparent he is capable of earning considerably higher income and has taken no steps to test the job market.

Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.","An amedical doctor was reassessed and ordered to repay hospital billings already received as a result of services provided to patients.

The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken.

As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT.

However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits.

The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred.

Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and  having consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres (the blood alcohol content of the breath sample) contrary to ss.253(b) and 253(1). The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. and failed the roadside screening. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample, based on the smell of liquor coming from the accused. The accused did not comply and the officer read from his 'card' when making the demand. The card was found to be filled with the accused's telephone number, address and phone number. Although the accused indicated that he understood after each demand that it would take 15 or 20 minutes to allow any mouth alcohol to dissipate, the officer found that it could be done in minutes. The defence argued that this was a 'live issue' and that failure to produce the standard alcohol solution calls for a judicial stay of proceedings and costs. HELD: The application for production of maintenance records was dismissed. 1)It is the essence of the Crown's case that the results of the tests are obtained from the breath samples of the accused, which results in the determination of his blood/alcohol concentration. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoules. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution, rather than suppression, should be the starting point.""  2)The accused's right to retain and instruct counsel without delay was breached. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The requested production of the 'tools' was akin to putting a cart before the horse and putting a burden on the accused to demonstrate the possibility of a violation of his Charter rights."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of using a weapon in committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 246.2 of the Criminal Code. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order made by the trial judge to remain in full force and effect. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence would be reasonably capable of belief and in addition to the lack of competence on the part of defence counsel, the appellant would not have been tried by a court composed of judge and jury if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear for his trial in May."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds for appeal were that the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; that the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction could be entered; further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this court may allow. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was unable to say that the appellant's findings of fact were supported by the trial evidence or that her findings were not clearly wrong so as to contradict her assessment of the facts.  2)There was no basis on which the trial judge could have deduced from her findings that impairment is an issue of fact."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that SGI was liable in negligence on the basis that it failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which it could easily have done by carefully reviewing the support file. SGI did not publish the coverage policy, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. The appellant was found liable for failing to apply for the insurance coverage provided under the McCallum Hill SGI policy. The appeal turned to an examination of the liability of SGI to the defendants upon the third party claim. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the appellant as he gathered the information from the homeowners, reviewed the existing coverage, and completed the application. However, the trial judge found that the appellant and his company, SGI, were intermediaries within the meaning of the term 'facilitator of loss'. The appellant admitted in evidence that he undertook to provide the homeowners with insurance coverage equal to or better than the one offered by SGI. The evidence showed that the respondent had information about the coverage and premiums for number of insurers as opposed to the standard set of coverage provided by the insurer. The Court found that there were a number of differences in coverage requested, culminating in a twenty per cent reduction in the premium from that charged for the original policy. As the appellant had examined the existing policy, it would have prompted him to ensure that the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the homeowners would have very specifically referred to the special scope of coverage."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with an expedited arbitration before an arbitrator appointed by the court. HELD: The motion to strike is dismissed. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. If the case cannot be resolved on the foregoing criteria, must resort to an assessment of the balance of convenience. The defendants have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now cannot conceivably be met."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Crown was only required to prove either the behaviour described in s. 753(a)(i) or the one described in R. v. Lemaigre (2004), which dealt with the possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. The sentencing principles articulated by R. were adopted by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The accused is a long-term offender and the Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. If the Crown has failed to prove that J.R.S. qualifies as a long term offender, the court is required to impose a sentence on him."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. He was attending to pick up lumber at the defendant's premises. Prior to entering the premises, he did not see anything located on the side of the desk facing towards the glass. He did not observe any obstruction at the other end of the dolly as he proceeded through the glass doors to the lumber yard. He testified that he was forced to hire additional employees to perform the work he had performed himself. Awarding the plaintiff $8,500 by way of general damages, that the defendant had not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and, therefore, failed to use reasonable care for his own safety. Recognizing that not even the exigencies of Western Canadian winter conditions would make a presence on the floor of a large bank in a city of 30,000 to be an 'unusual danger', the sum of $5,000 was awarded."
c_1993canlii4476.txt,"The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them. Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility.

9_2002nssc264.txt,"The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff obtained a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet that became a supermarket. The landlord promised to restrict competition by other tenants. The receiver applied for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a permanent injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer harm not compensable in damages if their escape from the bargain did not cause irreparable harm, and that the balance of convenience was with the landlord not the tenant. Application for permanent injunction dismissed. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There was no evidence of a mistake in the expression of the terms or the lease amendments. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The case for the receiver was simpler than that for the landlord and M.C. LeBlanc because the landlord is party to the Sobeys lease and is entitled to enforce the lease as a party. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the receiver's case is to be assessed simply in light of the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms. There is no suggestion of ambiguity."

The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent.

5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of failing to ensure that a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations and in both cases, he committed an offence contrary to the Criminal Code. The defendant was fined $250,000 for failing to properly supervise and inspect the guardrails before work commenced in that area. He also received a $500,000 fine for breaching the terms of his employment agreement. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the court found that the defendant had a high degree of moral blameworthiness and that he made an error in judgment in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail. This was more than a mere slip in judgment; it represented a serious failure in the defendant's implementation of its safety regime.

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.

5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had placed the children in one home for adoption, because notices of proposed adoption had been given.

They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency, and that they had supported the applicants aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children.

The court found that the evidence from the parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting courses and parenting counselling was not significant enough to make meaningful difference and result in improved parenting that would enhance the children's lives. The children's biological father is not the biological father of the children and neither parent values the services offered by the Agency. The parents have completed 35 sessions of anger management management training and are working to become better parents. The father has indicated that he is not going to allow the children to have a normal life.

The court was able to enter into an agreement with respect to the settlement negotiated with the parties. 5) In the event of non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud the defendant is to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client privilege in that there was no disclosure or disclosure in the execution of the minutes.  6) The court is responsible for all costs arising out of the application, including the admission of the parties of the settlement agreement, the settlement settlement fee and the associated costs."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The plaintiff claims he was physically assaulted and that he lost his aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago when he was a student at the Residential School. The Attorney General applies to strike the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of the 15 month time limitation period. 2) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional torts committed by its servants and officers occurring prior to June 1953. 3) The fact that the claims relate to internal management of the Residential Schools and acts that were 'distinct and separate' from any public mandate is best determined at trial.  3) In any event, the decision is based on the narrower ground that this court had no jurisdiction to entertain claims arising from the intentional tort occurring before the proclamation of the Crown Liability Act in May 1953. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 1 S. 6.1, at paras. 12 and 31. 4) The language of s. 24(1) is clear and its meaning unambiguous. It may be that the plaintiffs have cause of actions they can pursue under the Exchequer Court Act or its successor, the Federal Court Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. The plaintiff alleges continuing injury and damage. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury/damage ceased. 5) The ability to obtain equitable relief against the Crown by means of an ordinary action against it in provincial court is not limited to the 12 month time limit period under s.3.1. In this case, the plaintiffs purport to bring this action against the federal Crown pursuant to the Crown's Liability and Proceedings Act and against the other defendants as Crown agents. It should therefore be left to the trial judge to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","An appeal of a decision which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee, the Executive Committee and the League of Educational Administrators dealt with the issue of whether the appellant had misrepresented the substance of a report prepared by the Professional Development Unit to the principal of a school which the principal was a part of. In the discipline committee's decision, the Discipline Committee recommended that the principal be transferred, when in fact he was not the principal. The discipline committee imposed a fine of $2,500. The Executive Committee chose to accept the evidence of the principal over the appellant. This was a finding of credibility which was amply supported by the evidence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the findings of fact and applying the standard of proof as set forth in s. 51 of the LEADS Act, and ordering a new hearing or further inquiry by the discipline panel, that the conduct of the appellant was so clearly wrong, incorrect or contrary to the conclusion reached that it was unreasonable to award the appellant such a sentence."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. He negotiated a sale of hash oil with the complainant, who was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to confront him and get his money back. At that point the complainant pulled a knife and threatened the respondent, who had only been away for five minutes. Eventually the respondent took the money and took the knife, taking all the change and jewellery that was laying on the counter. The appellant was 32 years old and had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for his conviction of 1992 for robbery, his parole was revoked in 1995 and he was held on Remand until the date of sentencing in September 1995. Taking into account all the factors leading up to this point, the sentence of three years less one day concurrent for each charge should have been increased to three years. Taking all of the factors into account, the Crown should have recouped a very large sum of money rather than a very small sum."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held, and in particular the order in which the witnesses will be discovered, were entrenched. Further, the factual findings justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs as well as an award of solicitor/client costs in a limited amount."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application lacked a claim under the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp), and has never been amended to include such a claim. The children have had their primary residence with the petitioner for the last three and one-half years. However, the respondent has engaged in parental alienation. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was not an attempt to change the interim parenting arrangements made for the children by the petitioner. It was an application to enforce a previous interim order made by the respondent that had been made for only four months. There was no reason to believe that the children would be at any risk in the meantime. The Court ordered an adjournment of the petitioner's application to enable her to make this application. 1)The petitioner was granted custody of the four children. 2)The interim parenting order was to be applicable in the short term, on an interim basis only, to ensure stability in the children's lives. 3)The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order. Each party was to file their own affidavit supporting their position on the issues. 4)The court was to respond to the purpose, intent and substance of the respondent's application rather than the form."
3_1993canlii4594.txt,"The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police. He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted. He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand and gave him the usual Charter of Rights warning. The next day, the accused was observed entering a nearby building and driving off with his wife in his vehicle. The two officers then radioed two other police officers to stop the vehicle and noticed that the vehicle was being driven in an irregular or improper manner. One of them noted a strong smell of alcohol coming from the accused's breath and his speech was somewhat slurred. The second officer radioed another police officer, who at the scene radioed the other police officer to check to see if there was any alcohol in the vehicle. Based on the observations made by the officers, the stop was not random. The arrest was not made in good faith and was a deliberate breach of the Charter made for an illegal purpose. The fact that the police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion, they had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for their stop. The Court found that the trial judge was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)It was clear from the learned trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the ambulance attendants and that of the police officer who came along later that he rejected the theory the appellant's counsel advanced. He was perfectly entitled to reject the theory. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The accused had much different story. He thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge, even though he appreciated the candid evidence he gave, clearly accepted the evidenceof the ambulance attendant and police officer over the accused's version of what took place.  2)The learned judge was entitled to accept and rely on the testimony of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction.  3)The trial judge was well aware that on the evidence the accused initially entered his vehicle for the purpose of driving, did, in fact, abandon that purpose, was subsequently found behind the wheel of the car.

c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the other counts; and trafficking with intent to supply cocaine to a third party for 10 years. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking, lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for acriminal organization and the motivation was financial gain. HELD: The sentences imposed were 30 months concurrent for each of the last two counts, and 30 months consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. The respondents had already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by sentencing judge for which they were given credit. The total sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served.  1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the “deal” phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure that they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. The Crazy Dragons expanded into Saskatoon in 2005 to set up business in the crack cocaine trade. The police recorded on wiretap in excess of 600 drug deals made by the respondents. This would have involved minimums of 300 grams and a maximum of 2.1 kilograms for proceeds of between $36,000 and $180,000. These offences included cocaine trafficking, trafficking, conspiracy to sell cocaine, and possession of stolen goods. They were also charged with obstruction for giving false name to the police. In the early days of their release, one of the respondents was stabbed and killed. The effect of this incident was to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory consecutive penalty for the aggravating offence. 2) The sentencing judge was convinced that the respondents made significant changes in their life and were by all appearances rehabilitated. Considerations of parity alone would have warranted"
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","When his son, a grandson, granted an option to purchase the plaintiff's farm, he retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The option was exercised in 1973 and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff in 1973. The title was encumbered by caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. He took legal advice in 1985 or 1986 as to his chances of avoiding the reservation in such a way as to assure he got the money instead of the defendants. He was advised that since he had an unencumbered feesimple title he need not recognize the contractual reservation. HELD: The Land Titles Act is only intended to confer indefeasible titles on those who deal with the registered owner and deal with him on the faith of his registered title. It affords no protection to registered owner against equitable rights which he himself has created and is no defence when his own title is attacked by person rightfully entitled to the land. If a person seeking to buy a land for another takes the title in his own name and is merely trustee for him and the court will enforce the trusts unless the rights of the bona fide purchaser in the meantime intervene."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word'supervised' in the first condition.  1)The trial judge must have been influenced to substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in a manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the appellant's record, is excessive. In addition, it will no doubt mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress in a wrongful dismissal action brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic Provinces and it was expected that the appellant would provide her with 3 months' notice. The trial judge found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. HELD: The appeal was allowed.  1)The jury found that if the appellant employee was entitled to six month's notice, it was not a case where they should be given. 2)Because the conduct of the appellant prior to the dismissal was high handed and callous, it cannot aggravate the damages resulting from that dismissal. Rather, the damages must flow from the inadequate notice and not from the act of dismissal. 3)The court found that the mental suffering of the plaintiff did not have to be suffered in order for her damages to be awarded."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The Court had reviewed the definition of 'ordinarily resident' as it is used in the subsection and the time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 2)Saskatchewan is a province and the Foreign Judgments Act is set out in s.3(a). Where an action is brought in this province upon a foreign judgment, it is sufficient defence: (a) that the original court did not have jurisdiction for the purposes of this Act; (b)that the defendant, being defendant in the original action, was ordinarily resident here when the action was commenced; and (c) that it does not appear and submit to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan. The Act reflects that difference."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and brought an action for the recovery of damages from the defendants. The issue of liability was severed when a civil jury trial was held in April 2000 and found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff in his failure to wear a seatbelt. The defendant offered an interim payment in the amount of $168,000. The plaintiff sought to recover a substantial amount of non-pecuniary damages which in the opinion of the court were likely to recover by the plaintiff after taking into account any relevant contributory negligence and any set off, cross-claim or counter-claims. HELD: $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiff and an order will issue accordingly.  1) Even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by discovery examinations or an independent medical examination, it is likely, given the clinically objective nature of the medical findings to date, that the plaintiff will recover substantial amounts of special damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory liability and any arguments of failure to mitigate that might be raised by the defendant.  2) The defendants were awarded costs of the civil proceedings in respect of the plaintiff's application for interim payment of damages. The amount of the interim payment was determined to be $1500 plus taxable disbursements."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","An appeal from conviction on a charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the learned trial judge in Colonsay misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The only reasonable inference that can draw is that the stolen that the accused stole the generator. 2)The appellant argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the judge to proceed with the trial. The judge reviewed the facts and arguments in detail in a dissertation which occupied approximately 6 pages of the trial transcript.  3)Counsel expressly agreed at the hearing pursuant to s. 786(2), that the case at trial proceeded by way of summary conviction by agreement.  4)There is no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is impossible to determine whether the judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence is excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had always resided in the matrimonial home with their parents until the 3rd day of November 2000 when the petitioner removed them from the home and brought them to Regina. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident in Saskatchewan. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. He delayed in bringing an application for custody in British Columbia because he mistakenly believed that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the home, he did not allow it to be assumed that she had left quickly and secretly to prevent him from taking any court proceedings in BC to stop her move. 2)There was no evidence about the schooling of the son, nor of the career plans of the petitioner, or of the care to be provided to the two children while she was out of the home working. The grandparents were ready, willing and able to assist their son in the care of his care. However, British Columbia weighed heavily in favour of the convenience of British Columbia. The persons who can attest to the professional, social and family circumstances of the young children reside in the province of BC where they have lived all of their lives. It is likely that their teacher, playmates, parents, school professionals and others, including the petitioner's psychologist, may be called to testify about facts and circumstances bearing on the children's best interests."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.

d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant appealed the trial judge's finding that the accident did not contribute materially to his present poor health and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. She also awarded general damages for general pain and suffering, with a correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. Appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs; the appeal and cross appeals both dismissed with the exception that, although recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and at the same time, recognizing that a pre- existing condition was the major cause of his present medical problems, the same judge assessed the general damages at $25,000. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, plans, software and other TFPG related material respecting clients of the defendant. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the applicant whereby the respondent agreed to sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of the applicant and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. HELD: The applicant had met the test for injunctive relief. It was too restrictive and denies other individuals freedom of choice as to which party they wish to deal with on their investments. Counsel for the respondent relies on the decision in Height of Excellence Financial Planning Group v. Dixon, [1999] S.J. No. 629 (QL); 1999 SKQB 101 (Q.B.) as support for the position that the application should be denied. In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court (1) that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; and (4) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination, as to whom party, on balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of the application."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, user of the Borden driveway, is securing access to No. Highway over the other driveway in Roy Longard's property. Roy wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Bordens driveway. HELD: 1) On the basis of the Statutory Declaration and the fact that the plaintiffs' ancestors divided the land and each occupied their respective lots, Eldred and his brother, Roy, conveyed the lower portion of the family land to the defendant. There is no mention in the deed of either of the parties in the present deed of this land. 2) This use continued uninterrupted after Eldred received the portion of Eldred's property and as long as Borden remained on his property and continued when the property was transferred to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which sold the property in 1995. This usage is not in dispute. It is just that the parties' access rights were not established until 23 years after the deed was executed. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as the roadway running proximate to and accessing the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds. 3) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the respondent's property or incorporates the driveway. This is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein. Prescription or 'Lost Modern Grant' (the defendant's understanding is insightful he used the entrance entrance but he knew he didn't have a right of way over it and so made arrangements with his brother to obtain a right over it. Thus, the claimant must demonstrate that he has the right to do both.

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.",The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. The Court found the accused not guilty. The Crown submits that the offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and that its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers and highway equipment when he was travelling faster then 60 km/hr. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle. The speed monitoring device must have photographed it.
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of the Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than a class gift. Counsel have urged the court to find that this interpretation is in accord with the fair and literal meaning of the actual language of the will. HELD: 1) There is no need to resort to the rules of construction and assess the words of the Will in light of the surrounding circumstances. Even if had done so, the result would have been the same. 2) If the intention is not clear from the Will itself, it must be determined from the Rules of construction. The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put it into practice. 3) There was no evidence of the immediate consequences of an attempt to copy or alter the will in such a fashion as to avoid the possibility of a later divorce. If such an attempt had occurred, the court would have found that the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. 4) The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the Will."

d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under a credit line and Visa credit card account. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the respondent received an accident injury settlement from SGI. In the alternative, the plaintiff bank defended and counter-claimed against the defendant for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial, and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff bank's claim was dismissed in total. 1)The plaintiff Royal Bank expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement it authorized the Royal bank to release to Equifax the information that it did. This part of the plaintiff's claim against the bank was dismissed. 2)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff and in keeping with its contractual and fiduciary obligations towards the plaintiff. 3)There was no evidence that the characterization of these loans as being 'a bad debt, collection account or unable to locate' was out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the facts and circumstances that persons using and relying upon the Equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. Although there was some argument as to whether or not this or some other credit agreement formed the basis for the credit and loan presently sued upon, no other agreement was produced by either party to suggest that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P3 existed."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door.

The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the driver of the vehicle. HELD: 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, the defence evidence lacks reliability. The police officer, who was driving the police truck, was adamant and unshaken on the main points of the evidence. The time lines were considerably different from time lines given by the complainant. The officer was of the view that the individuals they had spoken to earlier in the evening were not in any shape to be operating a motor vehicle. 2) The keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle for approximately 1:00 am. 3) The accused was very evasive in cross-examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination-in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the complainant caused him considerable concern. 4) The defence evidence lacked reliability. It does not accept that evidence nor does it leave me in a state of reasonable doubt."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the only viable options were to permit the petitioner to relocate the child to the Archerwill district or to change the primary residence of the child by placing him in the home of Rocky. The petitioner had foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kindersley district where there existed a de facto split custody situation.

The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed.

In the meantime, SGI has filed a Notice of Appeal and a transcript of the trial was not filed. HELD: The appeal is allowed to be filed and the appeal set to be argued on its merits. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances. 1) Interpreting the legislation in a manner that requires the appellant to take all required steps and allowing for court intervention when matters arise beyond the control of the parties is consistent with intention of the Act and is an interpretation allowed by the wording used in the section. 2) It appears for an appellant to 'file the transcript' there is no action required beyond the request to Transcript Services. That agency then prepares the transcript and files it with the court. Accordingly, the appellant plays no role in the physical filing of the transcript.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties.

The parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government of Saskatchewan to the extent that the PST collected and remitted by the plaintiff was improperly collected and paid. The applicant was awarded interest on the amount claimed. The court found that even if the Government was entitled to payment of the PST from the plaintiff, the third party contractors owed the Saskatchewan Government PST in undetermined amounts on materials supplied to the plaintiff. The plaintiff argued that the claim was barred by s.50(4) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and s.56(5) of the Saskatchewan Tax Act, as the portion of the claim barred by virtue of the expiration of the limitation period in the claim, the plaintiff is entitled to refund of the sales tax it paid to the government.

An additionalsix month period of secure custody for the armed robberies did not meet either the interests of rehabilitation or the requirements of deterrence. 2)The sentence was not fit for the seriousness of the offenses, there was a need to uphold public confidence in the law and the administration of justice.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","Two female employees of a unionized employer filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination in their employment contrary to s. 25 of the collective agreement. The employer applied for judicial review contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by collective agreement and that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the issue was confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant to s27(1) of the code, which was to defer to arbitration in accordance with the common law. It granted the respondent the costs on double column 4 in the Court of Queen's Bench and on the appropriate tariff in the court below. 1)The parties agreed to comply with the Human Rights Code. The mere fact that the parties included an anti-discrimination clause in the agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. 2)The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. 3)A collective agreement is not a vestige of a public right guaranteed by the Code. It has an essential component, namely the right to contract out of it. To find that it is, with the result, a violation of that right, would be contrary to public policy. 4)Discussions about collective agreements must take place within the context of the Agreement. The parties agreed that they would not enter into any contract with each other. The terms of the agreement itself can play an important role in determining whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. 5)Discrimination is a fundamental human right which forms part of every employee’s contract of employment and is enforceable under the code. Whether this complaint is a human rights violation or a breach of that collective agreement depends on whether the dispute is one arising out of a collective agreement or a dispute between the parties that are bound by s16(1). The only method of enforcement available to the public is by arbitration. 6)In this case, the only forum which would be appropriate is an arbitration tribunal. The tribunal was not appointed to hear and determine the matter."

During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects.

The events surrounding the arrest involved the police officers arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for being intoxicated in a public place. The actions of the defendant outside of the lounge were in dispute as to whether the defendant's actions amounted to obstruction, whether it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code, and whether any reasonable force provisions of the Police Act applied. The defendant was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, 1997."

The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship. The only issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support.

The respondent is working part-time and the petitioner is looking to increase her income. HELD: The respondent will pay $10,000 to the respondent by lump sum. 1) The Court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. Accordingly, the Court must first consider if periodic payments would provide adequate support. 2) It is only when a lump sum is the proper vehicle for providing support or when lump sums are necessary to put a person in a particular position that such an award should be made. 3) There is a strong likelihood the respondent will move to Sweden in the near future. 4) Lump sum support is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances. Having regard to the education and obvious skills in computer programming, the court was satisfied that the respondent is able to obtain the funds necessary to make lump sum payment to the petitioner."

Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre Inc. or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The latter had deposed the applicants and asked them to relocate to a separate building totally occupied by the applicants. The applicants did not proceed by statement of claim. HELD: 1)The applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of s.4, regardless of whether anarrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine is applied. 2)If the alleged sub-lease renewals are valid, the Court lacks jurisdiction to grant the relief where sought solely by notice of motion. In the alternative, the applicants are bound thereby by the terms of the Statute of Frauds. 3)Reference cannot be made to renewal of the head lease because one was never reduced to writing. In this case the applicants' application was dismissed. 4)The only memoranda consist of the original head lease, the original subleases between VIP and the applicants, and the defendants' fax messages. The messages set out essentialrequirements for a valid lease which are canvassed in Saskatoon Business College Ltd. v. 607113 Alberta Ltd. 522. 5)While credibility is critical on an examination of the conflicting affidavits, a decision on issue nos.1, 2 and 4 can dispose of the application and perhaps the issues between the parties. Therefore will address them. While the Court has considerable discretion under s11 of the Act, it should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Re Golden Griddle. A grant of the relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of discretion."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused admitted smoking marijuana in front of a mall before returning to the courthouse for a meeting. The officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. They approached the accused and noted a smell of burned marijuana. The officer asked the accused where he had dropped the marijuana cigarette and he told them that it was at a mall. The second officer noted that the accused appeared tired, was very quiet and had not been given any order or direction not to leave. The third officer testified that he smelled marijuana in the vehicle and when he asked the second officer to step out of the vehicle, he smelled it on the accused. At trial, the Crown argued that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds. The defence sought an order excluding the admission of the defence’s statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search in the first place. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of possession of marijuana. He was acquitted of all charges. The Court of Appeal did not provide further clarification on the meaning of “a situation in which someone was apparently committing an offence” and questioned the standard definition used by the court in assessing the authority of an officer to arrest a person for a summary offence, such as being under the influence of cannabis. The facts were not in dispute. There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire: the accused was cooperative, the officer did not physically restrain him, the CPIC check indicated that he was pending on a drug possession charge and the fact that he admitted to smoking a marijuana cigarette in public place provide additional grounds for believing that the person was in possession of un-smoked cannabis marijuana."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. At the time of the application, the estate had refused to consent to the drainage and refused to surrender its right to future claims. The applicant filed a requisition with the clerk of the county pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant's costs were awarded to the respondent in the amount of $3,000.  1)The applicant was entitled to continue its ditch to a proper outlet and the respondent's fees were to be charged to the applicant. 2)The Act provides a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch or drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage. To address concerns about the effects of flooding, channel erosion and deposition of upstream sediment, the applicant's award of costs referred to the previous stage of the proceedings. 3)The respondent was not entitled to refuse to pay the engineer's fees. The respondent's award was incorrect. The Act provides that a party is entitled to a share in the drainage costs. 4)Full compliance with the provisions of the Water Act is required. 5)Parties are entitled to enter into agreements with the applicant regarding the drainage plan. 6)If the applicant is not satisfied with the terms of the agreement, the application is dismissed. 7)In this case, the respondent has failed to comply with the requirements of the Expropriation Act. 8)It is reasonable to assume that the respondent, as a subdividing developer, will sell off its land, leaving the Haverstock land with a gratuitous duty to maintain that storm sewer or drain for the benefit of its upstream neighbours. Where there is a conflict between the act and the provision of any other or special act, the provision prevails."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: 1)The lease was found to be in the public domain and was in the best interests of all the parties. 2)It was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained that a determination could be made about whether that time was too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule, which was not expressed in the terms of the lease. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3)The parties agreed to a habendum clause in the Freeholders lease which allowed the applicant to use a copy of the original 1950 freeholders lease. This was a form of lease which became effective on the termination of the primary term April 25, 1959. There was no production and the lease expired in 1959. If the interest would not vest within 21 years, the applicant could not proceed on its own. 4)The plaintiff was very interested in developing or participating in the development of the mines and minerals within the Taylor land. However, it was left to the defendant to determine whether the lease had been breached by reason of the common law rule.  5)Since the threshold issue at trial was whether the agreement of August 7, 1950 was a breach of the law, Maxx chose to negotiate a farmout agreement with Tarragon that was tantamount to a joint venture and the parties reached an agreement in principle. The only matter to be resolved was for the plaintiff to satisfy itself that the defendant had good title and to decide whether or not to proceed with the exploration lease. 6)The defendant was awarded judgment against the plaintiff. The costs were set at $1,000."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The respondent father applied to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001 by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck which he was using to exercise access to his children.

The court could not decide that issue on the basis of the material filed. Do not know if his former employment remains available or practicable or what efforts he has made to secure alternate employment.

c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending the outcome of their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had initially moved for a stay, arguing that a certification hearing would be a preferable procedure for the representative plaintiffs to advance their litigation. The plaintiffs sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. In December 2010, the plaintiffs filed a notice seeking certification under s. 7(1), naming of two classes of property owner and residential. In May 2012, the defendants filed an amended motion for stay, that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area but increased 7 year habitation requirement. The proposed boundaries were challenged in the Court of Appeal's decision. In September, the plaintiff filed notice of appeal, which sought to strike the certification order for common issues trial in class. The Province moved for stay pending certification. In the meantime, the AGNS filed a second action, this time against the Government of Nova Scotia, challenging the proposed boundaries. Application for stay dismissed; the parties and the court approached the December 2010 hearing as addressing an amendment to the original Motion, not a replacement for the motion which had been presented at the earlier sessions. The parties would be discovered whether there was a common issues case trial, under certification, or individual claims by those parties. There was no evidence that, in any quantum, this would affect the plaintiffs' marginal expense of conducting discoveries. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court."

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The charges relate to the failure to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers who were responsible for the work of the defendant. The defendant was aware that the plaintiffs were in the occupation of trenching and pipe-laying in the defendant's backyard. He arranged for the defendant to arrange for the plaintiff to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. Pederson had obtained a contract from the defendant that was one of employer to workers. This contract was arranged to be performed by the defendant, using the services of an individual he knew who was hired to perform the trenching. The arrangement was that the defendant would provide backhoe, fuel and a backhoe to the plaintiff, while the plaintiff would provide and maintain a first aid station. The plaintiff was to assist the defendant in laying the pipe, but he was not able to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters. Dismissing the charge, that the report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling and without making a formal comment on the legalarguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that the respondent had issued to the applicant. The respondent, who had been previously involved in the applicant's family law matter, criminal prosecutions and civil lawsuit, went on to assess the reasonableness of her legal accounts and, as required, some reductions were made. The applicant also made a motion requesting that she recuse herself because of an alleged apprehension of bias. The Respondent, who represented herself at the taxation hearing, agreed to limit the scope of the respondent's cross-examination to a period of not more than 1 and 1/2 hours, in addition to the fifteen minutes of cross- examination that had already taken place. She appealed to the Supreme Court. Dismissing the application, that there was no evidence of reasonable apprehension or bias on the part of the appellant.

Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought the custody of their child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interest. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as the custodial parent. HELD: 1)To review all of such evidence presented during the five-day trial would be unproductive and lead to prolix judgment. 2)The issues before the court were in relation to the child's best interests. The issues were whether the child should be under the direction and in the care of one parent for an extended period of time, if the current conduct of the parties had any bearing on her best interests, and if so, what steps the parent should take to ensure consistency and stability in her home life. 3)The child was to start the Buckwold Center program in the fall of 1996 with the full support of her parents."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse and (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006. The petitioner is not opposed to an order requesting (or more appropriately 'confirming') joint custody of the daughter with the respondent being designated as the primary caregiver and the respondent's residence being the primary residence of the girl. HELD: 1) The parties agree that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. Therefore, it is ordered that the petitioner shall pay 71% of the childcare costs and asthma medication costs of sufficient amount and peculiar to the girl as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and her income. 2) The petitioner shall bear the 71% interest of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described.  3) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary, s.253(c) and s.255(b). The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. The officer noted a strong smell of alcohol coming from the accused's vehicle and that he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. The accused's eyes were glassy and glassy. HELD: In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the accused was not guilty of the offence of impaired driving.  1)The existence of reasonable and probable grounds is central to the admissibility of breath and blood sample evidence. The nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the officer with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore, it is not reasonable for the officer to expect the accused to be able to secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable or probable grounds for the demand. 2)In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights and he was stopped behind vehicle at red light. However, thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired, rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. He appeared to be fully comprehending the situation at the time he took the breath demand. 3)The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. As well, he was aware of the presence of two green lights but he could not locate the accused seated upright behind the wheel, wearing a bathing suit. He grabbed him by the wrist and the accused woke up immediately and was able to comprehend what was happening. In the process of making its analysis, the Ontario Court of Appeal judgment made reference to the so-called 'classic' signs of impairment, namely: erratic driving, strong odour of alcohol, glassy eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet. Obviously this was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of given case."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father alleged the mother refused to implement his recommendations and as result the children were suffering. The mother relied on the assessment to support her concerns. The evidence disclosed that this was a high conflict couple and it was doubtful their parenting arrangements had any real chance of success. Nonetheless, the parties shared parenting arrangement had existed for some time and the father had been seeking sole custody since October 2003. In support of his application, the father alleged that the mother failed to implement the assessment recommendations, which led to the current custody dispute. Application to vary vary ordered; the Court ordered variation order to be made in the first part of the application to vary ordered. The court ordered variation ordered should be implemented immediately as the children's stress represents a developmental impediment and the parents contributed to the conflict. Both parents were capable of providing a stable, stable environment for the children. There was no authority in the Divorce Act to make an interim variation order."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found that the trial judge committed an error in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, namely, that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and she never went into the bedroom. The appellant also failed to establish that the sentence was unfit as it contradicted the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in such circumstances and the appellant had the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] and [1981] SCR 759 at 775 and be permitted to substitute it with a fit sentence."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman born in 1920 and residing in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan. In 1994 he moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with a Mrs. Essex. In 1996 he brought an application by way of a Notice of Motion to have the land registered in his name. This application was adjourned pending the resolution of the within application. HELD: The application was granted. The land was vested directly in the applicant's name. The court ordered that the land be vested in the name of the petitioner and that all other reasonable expenses be reimbursed. 1)The petitioner met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for the appointed property guardian. He was capable of managing his affairs and the balance was placed in the hands of the public trustee to appropriatelyadminister in his longer term best interests. 2)The court found that the petitioner was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. 3)As there were no facts in dispute in the matter, the court was prepared to grant the vesting order. 4)The land was to be given to the petitioner as portion of the costs of the proceedings. 5)In the event that the respondent chooses to sell the land he will be compensated in the amount of $7,000 which have been expended in dealing with the issue of the registration of the land. 6)Costs were to be divided equally among the parties."

Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S. The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of a Child and Family Services judge sitting on appeal from an order in relation to the child K.W. dismissed from the bench. The child had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The father appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence in respect to his fitness to parent the child. The Minister sought leave from the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the judge on appeal erred in ordering on a concurrent basis that the child be returned to his father. HELD: Leave was denied orally. 1) The application was dismissed. 2) There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal. It was clear from the very meaning of the word 'transition' and the wording of the order that the minister is to retain status as parent with the attendant decision-making authority until the transition is complete and the child is returned to the custody of the father. This period is subject to a number of conditions reflecting the recommendations in the psychological report. This power is not 'broad enough' to permit the judge to make an order that both returns the child to the parent, pursuant to S.37(1)(a), and has the child remain in the mother's custody for a temporary period, under the terms of a protection hearing order. Section 27 applies to protection hearings."

HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.

N-4.2 (Act) seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Act.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content.

At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect examination by plaintiff's counsel. At issue was whether equal latitude may be required in the defendant's cross-exam of the witnesses. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment with costs.

The plaintiff remains entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at her usual rate of $19.20 per month. 4)The cause of action is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired, the defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff has any complaints about her relationship with the defendants during this time, she is to be deducted."

The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had babysat the complainant for two years. At the time of the alleged assault, the complainant was living common law with her mother. The parties had retired to the bedroom where the accused retired to sleep. The Court found that the complainant had been asleep at the accused daughter's apartment when she awoke. She had not seen him leave the apartment until shortly after the incident occurred. Upon assessing the total evidence, it was concluded that the witness must be telling the truth. However, on her testimony, she was found to have been internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit.

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act.

She argued the loss of possible contact with and support from the father would be devastating to her relationship with her biological father. Dismissing the appeal, that the Chamber judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact of the adoption (the child's father had no contact with her and she had worked for her present employer for two years), against the loss to the child of possible relationship with or support from her father, and by placing too much emphasis on an irrelevant factor, the child's loss of potential relationship with a biological father if the adoption were granted."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R. Triple R was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff is not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it is possible, in that he has obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. HELD: Pursuant to subparagraph 57(1)(b)(ii), the plaintiff is entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and are properly recoverable. 1) Triple R is deemed to have given the plaintiff $2,000 as well as ceratin warranties. 2) In the circumstances, the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period of time. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and has failed to do so.  3) The law of contract clearly recognizes that there is a contract (the consignment contract) between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the purchaser (Triple R). There is no contract between Triple and Mr. Finch. 4) The consumer's right to choose between a consignee and a retail seller leads to a wider array of possible remedies than a regular breach. Consideration must be given to the exception provision at the end of the definition of'retail seller', which states that the bulk of delay in service of the claim upon the plaintiff was occasioned by the defendant's failure to pick up the vehicle. In this case the plaintiff relied on the Defendants agreement to look at the vehicle, with the implication that this would involve repair, and hence did not take other steps to have the problem dealt with. Once the plaintiff became aware of the seriousness of the problems, particularly with the engine mount, he proceeded with dispatch. 5) The actions of the plaintiff must be considered the actions of TripleR."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties applied to partition and sale of a lake front recreational property owned by them and their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another property that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed over and above the contributions of the others. Ronald claims that he has made improvements to the property that have made it more convenient for the parties to share in the maintenance and improvements. They also claim that they have received a fair share of the proceeds from the sale. HELD: 1) The Court's discretion to refuse partition under s. is limited. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious or oppressive. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons; the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the Respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%.  3) There must be a reasonable expectation that the parties will realize their capital value. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. It is precisely where an injustice arises without a legal remedy that equity finds role. 4) In seeking partition, the Court has discretion to grant an order which would cause inconvenience and hardship to the defendant but, if it thinks fit, to direct Sale of the Property. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions which may include, where one of the owners gives an undertaking to purchase the interest of the party requesting sale, valuation of the property; and in the latter case, to order Valuation of the Share of the Party requesting Sale in such Manner as the Court thinks fit."

HELD: The plaintiff's damages were assessed at $26,514.93. 1)The onus is on the employer to establish that its former employee failed to mitigate. This is not a case where a party already in breach of contract demands positive action from one who is innocent of blame. 2)Pre-judgment interest was awarded in the amount of $30,737.93 plus costs. 3)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her loss, which included turning down an offer from another company for a new and experimental position.

The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order for production of the original cancelled cheques. HELD: The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or to'redeem any redeemable shares' rather that the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent a debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129. There is no merit to the defendants' denial in paragraph 2 of their original statement of claim that the corporation has any obligations to redeem preferred shares. The Court was of the view that s.34(2) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s.33(2). In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Corporation is or would be insolvent as required by s. 34(2)(a) of the Business Corporations Act if summary judgment were to be granted in favour of the plaintiff."
d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company he bought was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares of ABM. The trial judge found that the respondent never would have purchased ABM had he known the true financial condition of the company. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to which should be added the balance of the purchase price of $10,000, making an award of $1,710,000 for direct damages.  1)It is impossible to perform that reconstruction. There are too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence. Nevertheless, consideration must be given to what, if anything, should be awarded for the additional time, risk and expenditure incurred by the respondent as a result of the breach of contract. 2)Perfect restitution would appear to require notional undoing of the transaction some years after it was completed, coupled with an attempt to determine the net benefit or loss suffered by the clients as result of entering into the transaction. Sometimes the evidence permits a relatively accurate reconstruction of events on the assumption that certain things would or would not have happened had there not been no breach. However, this approach is not possible to perform in this case."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody of the two youngest children and maintenance for the three other children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. He spent more money on alcohol than he should have. The wife complained about the respondent's use of alcoholic beverages. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody of all four children and the two adult children under the Infants Act. 2)He was to pay the arrears of child support in the sum of $1,800. 3)The court was satisfied the respondent dissipated the property within the meaning of the Matrimonial Property Act and that he was entitled to keep his motor vehicle and other properties in his possession as his own. 4)The applicant was to have her name shown on the property and that of the other parties as her name was already shown in the lot."

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator asked that a hearing be ordered to prove his last will in solemn form for the purpose of determining whether the will was brought about by undue influence by the testator. She also asked that an order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate without leave of the court, until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. HELD: 1) The testator was appointed as his personal and property Power of Attorney. The executor of the November 3, 2005 will was granted the power of attorney. 2) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last will and testament in solemn Form. The question to be tried is whether the testatory at the time of execution of the will is subjected to undue influence. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to have viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application.  3) The applicant shall be the plaintiff and shall bear the burden of establishing the deceased's knowledge and approval of the contents of the Will. The applicant will be the defendant, but shall bear a burden of proof with respect to the alleged undue influence, and all the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial of the foregoing issues.  4) The Court recognized the difficulty of proving coercion which is part of undue influence and recognized the legitimacy of drawing inferences of undue undue influence from suspicious circumstances. It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses."
e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The offence occurred when the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area while she was asleep. The complainant told the accused that he had forgotten his phone. The accused then fondled and fondled the complainant and her breasts over her clothing. The two women stayed at the accused's residence between ten and thirty minutes. While the parties were at the residence, the accused moved onto the bed behind the complainant, removed her pants and positioned himself on top of her. On the second occasion, the complainant awoke to find the accused kissing her on the lips and on the other occasion, he fondled her breasts and digitally penetrated her. The assault lasted approximately 30 seconds and the accused stopped immediately when the complainant indicated her lack of consent. He was sentenced to nine months incarceration, concurrent on each charge, and one year probation. HELD: 1)Three years is the appropriate starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according to the aggravating and mitigating factors. This is no reason why the same starting point should not be used in case such as this. Sexual assaults are at least as high in terms of gravity, if not higher, than sexual assaults upon children. 2)The accused is 61 years old and lived in Labrador. He has two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. The most recent of these convictions was 14 years ago. The Court of Appeal held that the appropriate range for offences of this nature is conditional sentence ranging between three and twelve months. 3)In R. v. Ashby, 2009 SKQB 441, the court held that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances. The Crown and defence both filed cases setting out various sentences. The trial judge found that the accused was guilty of both counts and sentenced him to 30 months incarceration. A conditional sentence order was not available in this case."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault. He applied under s. 24(1), 7, 11(a) and 11(d) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure. The sole issue for determination was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim statements prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by s. 7 and 11. The Court of Appeal ordered the trial to go ahead but emphasized the importance of disclosure. HELD: The accused's application for disclosure was dismissed. 1)The court found that the Crown proposed to make disclosure to defence counsel subject to the 'trust condition' that 'victim statements, written and videotaped, on his own and away from the office of counsel, are not essential to provide disclosure and to provide a fair trial and defence'.  2)The accused was able to review the statements and videotapes as often as considered necessary by the applicant and his counsel to know the content, substance and thrust of them. It is important to note that the applicant contends not for less onerous trust conditions or undertakings but that disclosure be without a trust condition or undertaking of any sort. The Crown maintains that the trust condition is appropriate in this case. 3)There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights by the admission of the videotape evidence. It was clear that the accused was unable to participate in the defence of his charge and that he was denied the right to watch any videotape provided to him by counsel of him."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer did not have a conflict of interest and that it was necessary for the plaintiffs to be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because they had a mutual understanding of the terms of the agreement and that they would be unable to collaterally use the same lawyer to defend their client. There was no delay in the application. The reason the plaintiffs were disqualified was because their lawyer had given them confidential information which could prejudice them in the within action. As the plaintiffs possessed relevant information from a former client that could prejudice their client, a reasonable person would not be able to conclude that confidential information was imparted to the Holgates' law firm because the information was so relevant."

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","A motion raised the question of the right of an acorporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the governments' community bond program in order to establish its business.

The defence had filed a statement of claim only admitting the party's status and acknowledged that on the expiry of the 90 days from the date of the plaintiff's employment the defendant calculated commissions payable to the plaintiff based on payments received from her accounts. The failure to move to strike in timely fashion did not impact on the question of whether the jury notice should be struck.

The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","HELD: The applicant was discharged from bankruptcy. The court found that the horses were not exempt from her assets as they were not declared assets. They belonged to her children and she was entitled to compensation for the loss of household goods which had been taken from her. As the respondent suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and other related disorders, she had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. The mower was worth no more than $400 and the trailer was damaged by fire. It may be worth very little. The respondent’s evidence at the hearing was that she did not have any funds declared as assets at the time of her bankruptcy. Therefore, the court ordered that the applicant pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. If there were any changes in her income which would justify her paying a lesser amount, an application could be made."
d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in response to a 30 year non-compete clause which prevented it from operating a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business. Salsman had resigned from the company, leaving the plaintiff with only a few weeks to prepare all of the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. The opening of a new business was imminent. The plaintiff wanted an Interlocutory Injunction. HELD: The motion was granted. 1)The court had to consider whether there was a serious issue to be tried. The impending and imminent opening of the new business satisfies the requirement that of 41.04 2(c) that urgency exists and cannot await the determination of the motion for such a motion. It is obvious that once that new business opens, the effect upon the plaintiff company will be profound and there is really no going back. 2)There was no speculation when one considers a small community like Berwick, but it appears to be common ground that it is a semi-rural community with one drug store. When another drug store opens down the street, common sense would dictate that the new store would have a huge impact on the business. 3)The applicant was facing a serious threat to its business. It was just to issue the interim injunction. There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the applicant company (the loss of customers, market share, etc.) and the balance of convenience favored the plaintiff."

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it.

There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while disqualified (2) without a reasonable excuse, fail or refuse to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer to provide samples of his breath for analysis. The issue before the court is whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating is a motor motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused is presumed innocent and bears no burden to prove anything. After considering the whole of the evidence, if there is a reasonable doubt on any element of the offence, he must be found not guilty. 1) The Crown has failed to prove that Rookes was operating a vehicle on the evening of February 26, 2010. Hence, acquit him of the charges of driving while impaired by alcohol or drug and refusing to provide breath sample. 2) It must prove that the accused's GiO bike was drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than muscular power. The accused blew into the approved screening device twice. His first breath failed to activate the device. His second breath registered a fail result. As a result of the fail result, the accused is charged with three offences: (1) driving while over.08 contrary to ss.253(1(a)(i), (3.3) and (5) while disqualified from doing so (and, if it would have been preferable if he provided photographs of his own bike and called the repair person who fixed the wire on his bike, the reason for the absence of such evidence was not explored in cross examination.

The accused had been in custody since November 2004. The defence requested a delay in the release of the accused from detention to January 2005 due to the uncertainty of when the defence would be able to file for a new Notice of Pleadings and a change in the time frame for a preliminary hearing. Although only 21 years old, the accused had a significant youth court record; six convictions involving breaking and entering and theft, one for failing to comply with a disposition and recognizance, and one charge of being unlawfully at large. He was using an alias at the time of his arrest and was facing outstanding charges in Manitoba and Alberta and drug related charges in Alberta. HELD: 1)The accused was released on conditions including that he would not enter or consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs, not travel farther than 100 km. from the City of Regina without the consent of the officer in charge, or his designate, Drug Section, Division, RCMPolice, Dewdney Avenue, Regina, Saskatchewan, not later than 5:00 p.m. each Friday until the final disposition of the charges against him. 2)His release was denied for the same reasons that the defence applied for his release. 3)His lawyer was unable to accommodate the length of delay in allowing the defence to retain counsel. The court was of the opinion that the delay in releasing the accused could affect the defence’s ability to accommodate new counsel and the increased risk that the trial of these accused would take place within a year."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, which resulted in breach of s. and s. of the Charter. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the acquitted accused. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the ASD demand on the accused. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1) The trial judge found that the officer based his suspicion on three factors: the smell of alcohol, slurred speech and dry mouth; the time of the incident; the accused's nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the officer what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning. 2) There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. There was an element of reasonableness which was found to be significant in this case, especially in the context of the s. 24(2) Charter application.  3) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion and concluded it was not reasonable to demand a sample of his breath when the officer first asked the accused if he had drank any alcohol that evening. It was reasonable and there was no other reason for detaining the accused that he was not drinking at the time the demand was made. 4) The accused's actions were found to have shown an unfortunate disregard of his Charter rights."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","The appellant was convicted of breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code for the purpose of preventing further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia. HELD: A period of probation was an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the original agreement, and did not have any other purpose. The term of the probation, three years, was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The school board applied pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules for a determination of whether the defendant was liable for s. 86(1) of The Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuriessustained by the infant plaintiff or whether the Larsen was immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act for her personal injuries. HELD: 1)In the event the defendant is not liable, the plaintiff is only liable to the sameextent as the driver. That is, the defendant's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. The parties proceeded on the agreed statement of facts. 2)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 3)The plaintiff discontinued its action against both Robert Earl Kraft and Morgan Drive Away. Counsel for the school board supported the position that the Education Act was specifically directed to liability arising from motor vehicle negligence. Oppositely the Board of Education argued that the teacher's immunity was an exception to the general liability provisions of The HELD Act. 4)The argument that the schools were in conflict was not supported by the facts. The facts were the same."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the husband moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the husband in the amount of $1,411 per month. The wife, who recently commenced negotiations for retroactive upward variation of child support, brought an application for variation in March 2004. HELD: 1)The parties agreed that much of the husband's income since separation included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. The husband argued that these amounts should not be considered as part of his income for child support purposes. 2)The Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an income in excess of $150,000. The Court found that the husband had a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the wife than did the wife. 3)The wife was entitled to costs of this application."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for leave granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision dismissing the appellant's appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer finding that he was not entitled to temporary total disability payments under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appeal was limited to a question as to jurisdiction as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This Court in Doward, supra dealt with the standard of review by the Tribunal of decision of Hearing Officer at pp. 33-38, 160 N.S.R. (2d) 2. There is no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The Tribunal must, in such cases, afford an appeal to the Tribunal. Support for this approach can be found in the very wide scope of review of hearing officer's decision given to the tribunal by s.243(7)(e) and the Tribunal may have the same advantages as it does in cases that it does not."
3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.",The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages forbreach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaims for a mortgage debt incurred by thefather on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: 1)The lease was a valid lease which was repudiated by the father after he died in November 1993. The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1994 by the executors of the estate. 2)The plaintiff did not vigorously contest the lease as he did not oppose the farming operation for his father. 3)The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues.

b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child continued to live with the parents until November 2015, when she was apprehended by the RCMP. The RCMP were called to the farm where the child had been apprehended. At the farm, the parents and child protection worker met with the child's grandmother, who lived there for most of her life. The grandmother was angry and swearing and the young parents, who were not able to care for the child, locked the child out of the house, locked her in the house and threatened to strangle her and she was alone with the baby for about six months. The mother, who was working full time and living with the grandmother, was concerned that the parents had been involved in a physically abusive domestic relationship and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the six week old child. The father was charged under The Child and Family Services Act s.11(b) for assaulting the grandmother and threatening to kill anyone who came into the farm or their home without proper parental supervision and/or assistance. The young parents were ordered to participate in a parenting program designed to build a positive relationship between the parents. The order that the child be placed in the custody of the Minister's designated person of sufficient interest was not satisfied on the evidence presented that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in the child not being in need of protection. It was a question of what order should be made under s.17 of the Act. HELD: The child was placed in TK's custody for a fixed period of 4 months. That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested. The plan was to return the child to the parents' care in the same location as on November 2015 with the support of grandmother TK and a friend of her's. Even considering any programming done by the parents, I remain satisfied that this infant would remain in a condition that neither the father nor the mother participate in parenting programming pursuant to s.13(1)(b). The parents will be responsible for providing parenting programming to the child for four months."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the primary care of two children who were in the mother's care. The mother had recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Mood Disorder. The father, who was currently employed as a roofer, was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the sole care of either parent due to their ongoing mental health problems. Their mother, who recently won an award at school, was in the day to day care of her maternal grandparents, who reside next door to the mother. The grandparents were called to the father's home after the children had gone missing for the night. They did not proceed with full investigation. HELD: The Court held that the current parenting pattern offered by the mother and her current partner was unacceptable and would continue to compromise the children's ability to care for them. Therefore, the Court ordered a Section 19 custody and access assessment. The Court also ordered the removal of the current application to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day care and control of the children with the father. As the mother had been experiencing problems with her mental health, it was pertinent to note that the father is currently facing criminal charges for failing to provide primary care to the children. As well, the mother has a history of short term relationships with other men. The possibility of relapse is slight if the mother continues to comply with her treatment plan."

The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate.

The court offered several accommodations, including allowing his friend to sit with him, provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigant, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation. The trial proceeded in his absence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of a lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side.

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation was enacted in 1954 (Survival of Actions Act, S.N.S. 1954, c. 12) and it was reviewed several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in this matter. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. Whether the respondent was negligent and liable for damages in relation to the death of the deceased have not been decided. Whether Mr. McDonald was at fault is a question for the Legislature. 2) To succeed on their survival of action claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate and be enforceable by her legal personal representative against the defendant.  3) The fatal injuries legislation does not do away entirely with the common law rule barring wrongful death actions. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways. The claim under the Nova Scotia legislation is limited to defined class of persons. It provides for compensation for all of them, but in one action, and the compensation to which they are entitled is primarily for the loss of support they reasonably could have expected to receive from the deceased had he lived. If the redress is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial. 4) In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these statutory provisions, the Court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, its purpose and the consequences of proposed interpretations and special rules of interpretation."

ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA?

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition. She is essentially asking for an interim order temporarily allowing the appeal. The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. Costs of the application will be in the cause. The stay is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10. Ignoring the Texas hearings and orders invites contempt proceedings even if the appeal of the Justice Wilson's order were allowed and whether or not a stay is granted. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant farmer in the Grenfell, Saskatchewan, district agreed to sell 300 metric tonnes of flax to the plaintiff at a net price of $264.65 per tonne.

HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied. 1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view. He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime. Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items. The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable. 2)Even if the accused's rights under s.8 of the Charter had been violated this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the Charter. The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence. The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive.

On the contrary, the evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently. The evidence is real and tangible. 2)The application to exclude evidence was denied. 3)The police were lawfully present in the premises when the accused entered.

3_1996canlii6774.txt,"Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The two doctors were both practicing medicine together in Wolseley, Saskatchewan, since 1973. They had seven children, all of whom were studying for university degrees. The bankrupt had declared unsecured creditors but the trustee had determined that the actual amount was $138,109.70 of which was the claim of Revenue Canada. The trustee ordered that the doctors make combined payments of $3,349 per month for a total of 36 months. Upon their discharge from the Bankruptcy, the doctors would receive an absolute discharge. In the case of the bankrupt, they were awarded judgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000; the trustee was ordered to apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time to Germany's Revenue Canada; upon the bankrupt consenting to this judgment, the court found that this income level could not be maintained. HELD: The doctors' consent judgment option under s.172(2)(c) was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve.  1)The doctors were awarded an unconditional discharge.  2)The court was satisfied that the consent judgement option was the most appropriate."

Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","The defendant made a formal offer to settle with the plaintiff for $60,000. This offer was not accepted by the plaintiff and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial. Both parties contributed to the length of the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. The plaintiff was not really open to this kind of resolution. She accepted Rule 41A, which proposed to recover costs, disbursements and pre-judgment interest. The defendant sought $10,000 in trial costs, $850 in previously awarded costs and $5,092.57 in prejudgment interest for a total of $26,630.81. Both sought to double the amount of costs awarded after trial and double the party and party costs awarded post trial. There were problems associated with the construction of this home where both parties contributed materially. This was clearly the case with deficiencies. Ms. Campbell refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There is also an element of this joint contribution in relation to the septic system. HELD: 1)Rule 41A is a discretionary matter and the Court exercised its discretion not to award costs and the parties will bear their own costs. 2)There was no clear winner in this case. There should be a departure from the prima facie operation of the rule only where the interests of justice clearly require it. It was one of those cases where success and failure are shared almost equally. The plaintiffs were successful on many issues but the plaintiff was the party most responsible for the necessity of this trial."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The majority were bent web members or had one or more bent members. The failure rate was 8.3%. The remedy was to have the joists deslagged to allow for routine inspection of the welds. The court found that the respondent had failed to provide proper quality control to its customers. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the costs of the inspection and remediation of the Mayflower Mall. Granting the plaintiff $10,000 for the expenses of the remediation project, that the court could find no evidence of the danger to the occupants of the mall caused by the defendant’s negligence. The respondent was awarded $25,000.00 for the failure rate and $15,000 on the general obligation joist, which represented an increase of 2.28%. The court was also awarded $5,000 to the respondent for general damages and $7,500 on the bottom of the joist. To minimize disruption of mall operations, the court ordered that the remaining funds be spent on repairing the defective joists."

The time limit was exceeded by the time of the judicial recount provided by s.126-128 of The Local Government Election Act which was a judicial recount of the same amount of votes. The period of thirty-eight days had elapsed, which is within the time limits of s19 of the Act.  1)The applicant showed reasonable grounds for contesting the validity of the election and the Chambers Judge granted the fiat to allow the applicant to serve the notice of motion to determine this matter. The application to bring this application under s19(1) was filed on December 8, 1997 and the fiat was granted on the same day. Counsel for the respondents argued that the time did not commence to run until that returning officer's recount was completed. Saskatchewan's legislation allows for a recount by the returning officer because the first vote resulted in a tie. The Alberta legislation allowed for the recount but the time does not commence in the Alberta court until that officer has completed his recount. Grostky J. completed his judicial recount on October 30, 1997. Thus, a period of approximately 8 days has elapsed. 2)The court referred to the case of Regina ex rel. Fraser v. Tuckey, [1975] W.W.R. 191 in support of the proposition that the election means the voting and completion of the counting. The wording of the word 'election' in s19 (1) is interpreted to mean both completion of voting, but the completion of counting. 3)The application was also subject to change in the legislation as time had not yet commenced in Saskatchewan."

This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","Rule 4.07(3) assumes that a motion to dismiss must occur prior to the filing of a defence because it directs the judge to set a time for filing the defence.

The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. Rule 8.02 is an interlocutory and discretionary decision and only available if the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a failure to intervene would give rise to a patent injustice.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that National is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year HTP periods. HELD: 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be very sparingly and only in very exceptional cases and where the court is satisfied that the claims or defence are devoid of merit. 2) National has raised reasonable defences including breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present. There was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. The purpose of the statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions. There is no basis to imply improper motives. The words 'beyond doubt' or 'treason' are used interchangeably with the terms 'frivolous or indecent' either separately or more usually in conjunction with Rule 173(e). 3) In this case the Court found that the plea can serve to delay, but not defeat, the FCC action, and that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 4) The present application turns on the interpretation of the impact of the Court of Appeal decision in the CIBC v. National v. First mortgagee, 2010 SKQB 274 is of interest. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that the defendant's defences are so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the company's cross-claim into consideration."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant sought an order removing the executor of the estate pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act.

d_2014skca116.txt,"HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in The Psychologists Act and its predecessors, and their predecessors, which have a silent provision that a member of the College of Psychologists may appeal to the Court if a decision is made of that Court. HELD: The application was dismissed. The question of when right of appeal lies lies with the court, but only if the legislature has enlarged or diminished that jurisdiction.  1) There is no need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals' (SSR 27 at 41). Having regard for the nature of general appellate legislation, the proper meaning of s.7(2)(a) is that it creates the general jurisdiction of the court. The legislature amended The Registered Nurses Act by granting specific right to the discipline body and to the nurses to appeal in Queen’s Bench if an enactment is “confers only a limited right” (SSRB). 2) With respect to the Psychologist Act, it is of little relevance that many of the professional statutes are silent on the question of a Right of Appeal to This Court. If this Court were to draw a distinction between professional statutes and others, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s.8(2). 3) With regard to s.6(2), it is not strictly necessary to consider that Swanson, Rizzo, and Huerto refer to the analytical framework provided by the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the intention of the legislature. The Interpretation Act, SS 1959, 12, and other similar legislation have the same meaning. 4) It is an error to construe s. by asking first whether the legislature 'confers jurisdiction' when it states that there is no appeal from the decision of Queen”s Bench, but that it does not limit the member’ s.5 right of appeals. That is the general rule. 5) The Psychology Act is a clear expression of legislative intent establishing that an appeal lies to the court from a judgment, order, decree, verdict or finding in any other enactment. 6) There are no special circumstances in which the legislature intended to avoid a collision between the two."

The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds.

The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The defendant, Ritchie Bros., declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. These documents raised issues of breach of contract insofar as the plaintiff's alleged failure to refurbish equipment and to allow another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) There are indications the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. While a number of issues were raised at trial, the preeminent issue was whether clause 4.05, and its 14% commission rate, amounted to a penalty clause and whether the plaintiff should be relieved of its consequences. 2) In the circumstances, the plaintiff consigned his goods for sale to the highest bidder and was not precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly, in the bidding process. There were no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums. 3) The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of the plaintiff, was initially approached to see if he would be allowed to bid at the sale. He was not the only person who was trying to contact the plaintiff. When he was told he would not be able to bid, he was advised that he would have to wait until August 1, 2004 to make the necessary correction. 4) When the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. They then declared the contract void. 5) The plaintiff argues the taking amounted to trespass and conversion and seeks damages. 6) In any event, the issues in the final analysis are between litigants well versed in auction etiquette. The issues have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure. The individual applicants were husband, wife, and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The corporate applicants were companies in which various of the individual applicants are principal shareholders or directors. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The accountant was not acting as representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice but as a liaison between the client's accountant and the applicants' solicitor. He was acting as agent or representative for the client to whom the client was directed. 2)The 'lawyer's brief' rule was upheld on the basis that the accountant's brief was an accounting information given to the client by the applicant to complement the legal advice given to him.  3)There was no litigation contemplated in this case. The 'client privilege' extended to communications between the parties for the purposes of obtaining legal advice.  4)Soleman and client privilege extends to communications to or from third parties in the context of litigation. 5)In this case, the accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant. The accountant's role was to direct the applicants to the solicitor and to arrange for the production of the documents.  5)The central issue in this application was whether and to what extent solicitor andclient privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties for which the appellant is privileged from production of documents. 6)The fact that two of the applicant's sons were instructed to arrange a meeting with the accountant falls within the scope of communications between a solicitor and client. The fact that the son was instructed to prepare the documents for the accountant to receive and receive his solicitor's advice was not inconsistent with his personal presence or involvement in these communications. The better view, however, is that the more recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the appropriate relationship of agency for the solicitor."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling with a companion when he was approached by the accused, who was armed with a knife. The confrontation escalated to the point where the accused threw the knife at the complainant, who ran towards the vehicle. The complainant chased after the accused and slashed the vehicle's tire, but the accused ran and hid in an alleyway, where the knife was still in his hand. At trial, the Crown argued that self-defence was not applicable in all of the circumstances and that the accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused is guilty of the offence as charged. 1) The accused's action in leaving the area of confrontation and going back to his dufflebag to retrieve the knife and, in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, getting into his personal space, is completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the Crown may have perceived was made by the defendant. This defence does not succeed. 2) There is no issue respecting the identification of the accused. There is also no question the Crown has established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code. While it is the case that the ss.34(2)(d) factors clearly establish that both Mr. Brown and the accused were much bigger than the complainant and because of the latter's apparent state of intoxication would be far more physically capable, if force were to be used, no physical force was actually used against the complainant that would support a reasonable conclusion that the defendant's use of force was imminent or posed threat to Mr. Drysdale."

He was dismissed from his employment as a truck driver immediately after his conviction because he could not gain entry into the United States, because he now had a criminal record.

He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The sole issue on the sentence appeal was whether the trial judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. HELD: The appellant was ordered to appeal his conviction and to substitute a conviction for his conviction. The court was not in the public interest to order an absolute discharge. It was clear that the appellant may appeal the finding of guilt and make the request to substitute discharge for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1)The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Committee gave a lengthy written decision. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been properly explained to the Committee, they were reasonably supported by the evidence before it. 2)There was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the Committee's involvement in the hearing. The Director of Professional Review did not advise the appellant of such things as to the extent that he was prejudiced in his assessment of the patient costs associated with cardiology practice. He was found to be competent to conduct cardiology. His practice was unique in that it was based on a pattern of medical practice that was out of line with the billings to medicare by the other cardiologists. His evidence was uncontroverted with one possible exception: the negative assessment of his practice was made by a former cardiologist in correspondence with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. It was not known whether this correspondence was placed before the Committee.  3)It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose the duty to act fairly and to provide procedural fairness. It is not right that institutional bias is raised in the roles of the director and Committee assigned to them by the Act. 4)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings. When assessing the four criteria identified above, the Court must critically examine the evidence and ask whether, taken as a whole, it reasonably supports the findings of fact reached by the committee."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent, the applicant company, Jollymore, contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, which was contracted for use in the home of the deceased. There was no direct contact between the appellant and the deceased and the purchasing of all the material was left up to Jollymore who dealt with the flooring manager. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the respondent's home. During the construction, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by Jollymore or Maritime and did not receive satisfactory explanation from the respondent as to where the money went. The flooring remained in the deceased's home and the respondent has not received compensation for it. HELD: On balance the presence of a special relationship will be persuasive but not necessarily conclusive in the fact-finder’s analysis. The absence of such a relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim. The Court of Appeal held that there had been a contract between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it formally or indirectly. This relationship in turn is usually, but not always, marked by two characteristics, firstly knowledge of the benefit on the part of the defendant, and secondly, either an express or implied request by the defendant for the benefit, or acquiescence in its performance. The relationship in this case was that of either request for or acquiescing in the receipt of the benefits. The respondent was unaware that the work had been performed, and so it was held that no special relationship existed. The Federal Court in Robert McLaren, Garry Seeman and Donald Thompson v. The Queen, [1984] F.C. 899, subsequently determined the significance of special relationship. It may be contractual, fiduciary or matrimonial, or an unenforceable contract. It seems to be the sine qua non of success, but it is not an inevitable guarantee of success. special relationship is factor in all but two of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded. It is the essential nexus between the defendants' words and conduct, and the plaintiffs conferring of their benefit. The same is not true here as Joseph was unaware of the work was being performed and had in fact selected the carpeting."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant executor of the estate made a few specific gifts and then left her home to her son, who was her only son. She divided the residue of her estate between her two daughters, the respondents Sandra and Leslie Gallagher. In the 1990s, the respondent transferred title to the house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF to the appellant. The appellant took the position that the funds did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He paid about $45,000 to his sister, the residuary beneficiaries named in the will. The RRIF beneficiaries brought an action against the appellant claiming that she received it as trustee upon an express trust to be distributed to the respondents in accordance with the terms of the will; this appeal was against that judgment. The trial judge found, as matter of fact, that the respondent intended the funds to go to her granddaughters and to give the administrator a binding discharge. Accordingly, when the appellant received the money, the section was complied with and he was precluded from claiming the funds for himself. The appellants appealed. Appeal dismissed. There is something more than the lack of consideration proving that the transferor intended the money to be given to the grandchildren. The respondent's evidence, which was examined in all of the circumstances, was misconceived. It was open to the trial judge to arrive at a finding of fact as to the deceased's intentions out of all the conflicting evidence. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error."

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a number of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Corollary Relief Judgment in May 2004. In the fall of 2005, the mother, who had recently graduated from an American university, applied to vary the amount of child support payable by the husband (who had previously been granted $3,100.00 per month); in the spring of 2006, the husband cancelled the education savings plans (CST), claiming that they had been discontinued for non-payment. The husband argued that the mother had failed to meet the onus on him to change the circumstances related to the marriage, which had resulted in a different order of support based on his current income. Application to vary spousal support dismissed. The parties had made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The mother had finished course work in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and had not been employed or actively seeking employment since January 2006. The father's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month; his annual income was $153,116.76 US or $203,706. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the mother graduating from the American university in 2005. Any reimbursement due from the father's employment as result of the payment of private school fees would be retained by the father. There was no evidence of the mother seeking employment with respect to the establishment of AWEDANS. She was responsible for her own choices."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","The applicant sought judicial review of a Workers' Compensation Board decision denying him reimbursement for the cost of his medical marijuana. The applicant argued that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The Board found that it had the power to deny reimbursement as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of the Act. There is no evidence before the Board that it based its decision on the basis that medical marihuana is a controversial moral issue. It is well within the range of reasonable outcomes and is supported by the evidence. 2) There was no evidence that the board's decision to refuse reimbursement, made for an improper purpose, was based on irrelevant considerations (see: Heilman v. New Brunswick). The Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. The approach to interpreting legislation is articulated by Rizzo Rizzoli in Construction of Statutes (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1) and Mellor in Mellor (Mellor) 1 (QL) is one principle or approach. The words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme, the Act, and the intention of Parliament. 3) Based on the wording of the legislation and the context of the relevant provisions, it is not reasonable to suggest that a Board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of a particular drug, this does not appear to be the case here. The board did not rely on Policy Statement 5 or even mention it in reaching its decision. Therefore, even if it did, it did not decide the matter."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant denies responsibility for the damage and questions the quantum of damages sustained. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.  2) Apportionment of damages and mitigation. Even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional 2 days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. 3) The Defendant's claim against the plaintiff for damages totalling $1,250.00 and mitigation of damages of $100,000.00.  4) The Court assessed the value of the defendant's possessions at $800,000 and awarded quantum damages of damages to the plaintiffs."
1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff, Phoenix, applied for the dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin that it would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant and that the failure to make a reasonable effort to give full discovery did not impact the decision as to whether the fish should have been produced. The scales were kept at the defendant's plant and were regularly used by the plaintiff to check the fish tonnages. During its preparation for trial, the defendants pressed the plaintiff for information as to the true weight of its fish, which led to an apparent impasse on the correct methods of calculation and a great deal of confusion as to what information Skipper actually had. The retrospective calculation of landings using the method said to be employed by the defendant to calculate the paid weight of fish landings, according to plaintiff, led to the conclusion of an improbably (if not impossibly) efficient production or, (I add) to the conclusions that the weights were greatly understated by the use of the scales. The conflicting evidence and positions of the parties presented at this application made it necessary to make certain findings of fact and credibility. The only reliable information available was from the defendants' records, which were kept on a daily basis between the efforts of the employee who gathered the raw information and gave it to the employee, who entered it into the scribbler. These records were carefully preserved and had been relied upon by other employees of the defendant."

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The Court sentenced the two offenders to 40 months concurrent for the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The Court was bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict. The sentencing judge must not accept as fact any evidence inconsistent with the verdict rejected by the jury, especially when the evidence is of a person who aided in the commission of the offence. It is with these principles that the sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence."

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded.08 contrary to S.255(1)) and S.253(1(a)). The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the ASD demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused he made the demand, the breath tests were taken as soon as practicable. The defence argued that the 15 minute delay prejudiced the accused, as defence did not mention the s. 8 violation in its Charter notice and defence should not be allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife, who had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home, filed an Answer in September 2003. She alleged that the husband had failed to provide her with an automobile for the past year. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the divorce. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) whether the husband should continue to pay $1,000 per month indefinitely; and 3) if the wife's financial situation warranted it. Although the wife had made an effort to purchase a new vehicle, her financial situation had worsened and she no longer had the means to do so. The evidence supported a conclusion the support was only for 1 year.  4) the husband was entitled to spousals support at separation and that it continued to provide support for an indefinite period. The obligation to pay spOUSAL support as outlined in the Agreement was clearly reviewable by the parties. 5) The wife's lifestyle deteriorated as a result of the marriage ending and to a more significant extent than that of the husband's. Her financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue. Given the uncertainty about the future, the court ordered an order of protection to the husband in the absence of any evidence of the need for it. The court found that although the wife was able to work longer hours and earn more income, there were disadvantages related to its breakdown such that it was impossible to continue to provide such support."
d_2012skqb513.txt,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","HELD: The judgment was granted in the amount of the Admin Fees charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants.

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: The issue is whether the children are to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. The parties commenced common law relationship in 2000. There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the mother in La Ronge but with the petitioner having access on weekends. The evidence discloses that the respondent sold her home and business in March 2013. The petitioner says he asked the respondent if she was planning to move. The respondent says she hasn't replied. HELD: 1)It constitutes an error in principle, and reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. Once an interim custody arrangement has been in place for some time, whether de facto, by court order, or by agreement of the parties, the non-primary care parent should not apply on a final order. In this case, the parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent. 2)The interim order was made in the amount of $1500 payable within ten days from the date of this judgment."

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The plaintiff was found not liable. The court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in a series of articles published on newspapers and websites. The plaintiff did not file any complaints with the hospital or any of the defendants until the very last day of her trial, which was at which point she went into cardiac arrest and had to be amputated. The articles and their contents caused the plaintiff irreparable damage to her reputation and caused her to lose her hands and feet for a year. Counsel for the plaintiff asked the court to allow the statement of claim to be amended to add the defendant as a defendant. The defendants opposed this request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which could conclude that no actual prejudice would be suffered."

It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the judicial sale was granted. The reserve bid was set at $100,000. There were no further issues as the application to confirm the sale was adjourned until the next court proceeding from the local registrar.

The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.

HELD: The judgment was granted. The amount of the judgment recovered will be set aside and the remaining payments set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments. In the absence of a formal commitment on their part to do so, the Court cannot take that into consideration.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting portions of the University of Saskatchewan Act and the Act, particularly Section 51. 2. The Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation, including the context and purpose of the legislation, the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature, the contextual approach and the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result. Both parties relied on dicta from Dunsmuir in support of their submissions. HELD: 1)An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor the collective agreement. The right to grieve a decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board reversed a decision of one of the committees. The review decision left open whether the Board was bound by the president's recommendation or by the Agreement. 2)The Arbitrator found after reviewing the Saskatchewan Act, its provisions, and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the President in accordance with the terms of the agreement. He found that the Board may never grant person tenure unless and until they are 'nominated for the appointment' or'recommended for the promotion'. 3)The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  4)The dispute arose as a result of a dispute between the parties concerning the awarding of tenure and whether the president had the authority to appoint or promote a faculty member pursuant to the Agreement or, alternatively, whether it was an appointment or promotion within the meaning of that Act.  5)It was agreed that the parties would have to deliberate on whether the Act requires the president to appoint someone to a permanent position on the academic staff of the university or whether it is a power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. The arbitration decision dealt with whether a person can be appointed as a probationary assistant professor if that person has been nominated for the position by a president; if not that their employment expires at the end of a fixed term. 6)The arbitration decision was appealed. The parties agreed that a review of the decision would be necessary to determine whether a tenure award or promotion was appropriate under the circumstances of the time and place they were appointed."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabited with one another continuously for two years. The issue was whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the value of the Vancouver property was exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of the spousal relationship. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Whether it would be unfair or inequitable to allow the respondent to claim any right, title, or interest in the house itself was to be determined in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of s. 23(1)(a), and the equitable consideration regarding debts.  2)The trial judge did not err in awarding the respondent an equal share of the property. Rather, he treated the house as the matrimonial or family home.  3)The evidence showed that both parties were cohabitating continuously for a period of 2 years. 4)The respondent's application for distribution of the family property, having regard for the equitable considerations mentioned in s. 21 and s. 22, was governed by section 22 rather than section 21 and 23. The significance of this finding is that the fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between the parties spousals effective as of late June 1994 as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23.5. 5)The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell, 1999 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask. C.A.). 6)The appeal turned to the respondent's treatment of the house in Vancouver. The judge turned first to the exemptions provided for by ss. 23. More specifically, he turned to a subsection that exempts from distribution the fair market value of property acquired as a result of an exchange of property mentioned in subsection (1) rather than before. This is so because the house constituted an immoveable situated outside Saskatchewan. 7)Whether the respondent was able in principle to claim half the house pursuant to section 21 of the act, or to call the Vancouver house as a family home, was a more complex question, one that raised several issues. 8)"
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection. The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 2) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 3) There have been ten witnesses at trial, including one expert witness. Ms. Ansell, who was qualified as an expert, was admitted as evidence."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. The parties separated in 1983. The respondent had remarried and continued to reside in the matrimonial home. There had been a significant drop in his income in the years prior to the agreement, which had resulted in several defaults in the husband's financial affairs. He applied to vary the amount of maintenance payable to the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that while there had been radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no connection between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant had demonstrated that there would be a gradual change in her circumstances, which would justify a variation of the maintenance payable."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","The medical doctor appeals from decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal). The original suspension was done wrongfully and precipitously, and ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to statutory appeal. The appellant's evidence is that all options were reviewed with CC, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. This was done appropriately, as during the treatment of the uterine rupture, requiring remedial steps to safeguard the mother's welfare. The respondent operates health care facilities including hospitals including the appellant's. To do so, those doctors must first obtain privileges under the respondent's Bylaws, which require every health authority to make a bylaw governing the practitioner staff covering, inter alia, privileges and the matters in issue in the within appeals. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo appeal hearing. It is not an appeal on the record. Curial deference is not owed and the tribunal may (indeed, must) take its own view of the evidence put before it and is not bound by the views of the Board. HELD: The Court finds that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant met the standard of care and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges.  1) This case cannot be taken to be supportive of the suspension of the SMO. 2) There is no real nexus between this rare condition and other situations Dr. Abouhamra was called upon to manage in the course of his ob/gyn practice. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal is that the responses were accepted by the Tribunal and satisfied any concerns he might have had. Accordingly, the Tribunal suspended the appellant on an interim basis.  3) The Court concludes that the holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, or how things could be improved. The hearing should proceed in the same fashion as it proceeded before the Tribunal."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties separated in 2003 and the parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004 the petitioner moved with the children to Alberta. In 2005 the three children moved back with the petitioner. In 2006 the petitioner paid child support but the payments were based on an imputed annual income of $26,500. The petitioner sought to recover the cost of orthodontist fees when the respondent exercised access. Yet there was no variation of the June 2004 order which required the respondent to pay $285 in support for the children. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance should be treated as income for the purposes of calculating child support. 2) The petitioner should have paid full day's wages in each year except for June 2004 when two children were residing with him and one with her. This was rectified by moving portion of the capital costs allowance into income. 3) The respondent was to forthwith pay as court costs the sum of $1,200."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied for court appointed counsel. The accused was denied access to the court, and the matter was adjourned so that the accused could inquire into whether he could obtain a bank loan through court services or equity in real property. At trial, the Court will consider whether the accused has demonstrated the requisite circumstance of being indigent, and whether any conditions should be placed upon the appointment.HELD: The accused is out of luck. The Court of Appeal set forth protocol for an accused individual to pursue in seeking court- appointed counsel in cases not falling within the provincial Legal Aid plan. The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority. Only in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as an accused is the Court required to make an order appointing counsel. If no financial institution was prepared to provide him with funding utilizing his equity as a security, that might well cast a different light upon the question of his indigency. The essence of the accused's application is that he wishes counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer. It is his understanding that a private lawyer would charge him thousands of dollars up front as retainer and as he has no savings and very little disposable income, he cannot afford to retain a lawyer. The cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to the potential trial will also enable the accused to attempt to secure funding utilizing this significant equity in his home."
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellant medical society appealed a decision of the Regional Hospital Board to release a peer review report prepared for the purpose of internal evaluation, education and improvement of hospital care and practices. Dismissing the appeal, that the report was an educational tool and was not intended to be used for the purposes of providing answers to family questions. Rather, it was intended to provide an opportunity for physicians to participate in the peer review process. Physicians who had previously been approached by the hospital were to be the authors of the report. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that the review would be confidential. As a result, the appellants and the medical society had no right to know what happened to their brother. The report was never released to the public. Many of the physicians who were contacted by the appellant testified that they thought the report would be a confidential document and that they had no assurances they would be getting a copy. Denying the application, that (1) there would be some reluctance on the part of the appellant physicians to take part in future peer review, and (2) there was no evidence that (3) they would participate in future written peer reviews and (4) that they would have any right to criticize the hospital for failing to do so. The doctor who prepared the report for the appellant was the personification of peer review. The rest of the evidence was from the appellant's counsel, who was the medical director of the hospital. The appellant was referred to the summary of the review team report, dated February 23rd, 1996, prepared by Ms. MacIsaac and the administrative group, and expressed his concurrence with the concluding paragraph that reads: 'The report of Drs. Kutcher and Kusumakar cannot be released in its entirety because it was prepared as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of their participation in the process.'  In other words, the report could not be released without the consent of the families. (5) The appellant medical director testified that she had personally participated in a review of the circumstances surrounding the death of her son. She was also referred to as the C.E.O., which in turn meant that she would be the personifying person in the hospital who would be responsible for overseeing the review. She also indicated that she was not aware of any individuals who had participated in the review process prior to the appointment of this doctor. She indicated that her role was to be to provide guidance to the appellant as well"

HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. The deceased had a small stroke which affected his speech temporarily few days before the will was signed. The doctor testified that in his opinion the doctor could instruct and complete last will and testament at that time. Evidence now before the Court by one of the witnesses to the will is that two and one-half years before he signed the will, he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will, which was never signed because of family pressure. The lawyer had instructed the executors to draw the different will in order to better serve their family, who supported their decision. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. 1)There is a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executor and his counsel provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the lawyer. 2)Our role as gatekeeper is to prevent the issue for trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted at trial, would tend to negative knowledge and approval or testamentaries capacity.

The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","HELD: The application was granted and the evidence taken on voir dire was to be considered in support of the search. The court found that the accused had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the defence of his s. 8 Charter rights. There was no dispute that the Crown could adduce evidence to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time the ITO was sworn. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the warrant. He also argued his s8 Charter rights had been violated as a result of the seizure. The issue was whether any evidence was admissible in respect of whether the accused's Charter rights were violated. HELD: 1)The evidence was not included in the original ITO. The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting minor errors in the drafting of their affidavit material. The practice in 2013 was not necessarily to review the warrant prior to completing his forensic examination. This practice has since changed. 2)There was insufficient evidence at the hearing to establish a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the Internet history or the presence of any actual messages between the complainant and the accused. The evidence was entered to amplify what the accused actually swore to in the ITo. 3)The accused was not seeking to circumvent the provisions of s. 24(2) of the Charter. Rather, he was seeking to use amplification evidence to correct minor or technical errors made by the investigators, but which were done in good faith and not with an intent to deceive or mislead."

It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of 1 year set out in The Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The limitation period for applications under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act had not yet commenced to run. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The applicants met the requirements of s. 44(11). As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments request. 2)The plaintiff was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as plaintiff at the original action. The fact she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. 3)The court reviewed the requirements for the exercise of judge discretion with respect to adding parties or adding a new claim where a limitation period has intervened since the commencement of the action. It was difficult to conclude when the delay was a maximum of little over 3 years as in this case."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

The parties' home was now debt free and the respondent's was also worth $1,000.00. 3)It was not extraordinary for one spouse to bring substantial assets to the marriage which are used to purchase a family home.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and breach of probation by failing to keep the peace and good behaviour. The complainant was child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with the complainant. The defence argued that the accused was not exercising criminal law power and his entry to the complainant's suite would be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search was determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. HELD: 1) The Court held that the information provided by the police and the complainant was sufficient to establish that any contact between the children and them was harmful to them and they were immediately in needof protection. The fact that the complainant believed that the father had contact with her on this date does not alter that situation. 2) The totality of the evidence was to the effect that the officer had no lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment. He was not in hot pursuit of an individual, and had not pursued him to this residence. 3) The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the apartment was excluded from the evidence."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiffs were awarded costs of the action against the defendant, who was a friend of the plaintiffs. The defendant had cut down trees on the plaintiffs' property, claiming to be doing a favour for them. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for tree removal, claiming negligence by the defendant. Dismissing the claim, that the defendant was not a paid employee of the plaintiff, but rather was involved in a joint enterprise with the benefit of the other parties. The plaintiff was not seeking to have the tree cutting occur on his property; the issue was whether the defendant became vicariously or jointly responsible when the defendant went on a 'frolic of his own' as the plaintiffs had alleged. The courts in both provinces have jurisdiction to deal with such matters. In this case, the Court allowed the costs against the plaintiff in the amount of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $5,750, and found the defendant to be jointly liable. The claimants were allowed to take advantage of any assistance that might be forthcoming from the defendant Burrows, either by allowing him to arrange for the work or negotiating for access."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog had run through a woman's front yard and then into the alleyway where it upset the woman's daughter. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on these four separate occasions and whether the accused took reasonable steps to prevent it from occurring. HELD: The accused was convicted of assault. The court found that on the definition of attack, the dog was in close proximity and was snarling and barking, but in that case she was inside of her residence. The appropriate fine in the circumstances was $200. 1)The accused did not take reasonable steps on any of the four occasions described in the decision respecting the conviction of the accused under the Animal Disease and Protection Act. If the accused had not taken reasonable steps, the court concluded that the offence could have been prevented by other reasonable steps taken. 2)There was clear evidence that the dog had been kept within an enclosed fence and the fence must be continuous, surrounding the perimeter of your property and include a gate or gates which prevent the dog from exiting the property except when on a leash. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the Crown's conclusion of an attack beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused's evidence was not discredited or effectively discounted in cross-examination. 4)The dog's actions might have justified requiring a hearing under the other section of The Urban Munipalities Act but in this case there was not, in the Court's opinion, any attack on her on that date. Corroboration of the evidence in relation to the location of the dog and its behaviour was sufficient to justify a hearing. 5)If the accused leaves the premises, he shall muzzle and leash it in accordance with prescribed criteria (and those criteria are set out in the Regulations). The accused shall obtain and keep in effect liability insurance in an amount not less than $300."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) filed with the Court on the same date and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant's claim that he did not know the hearing took place and, when he failed to show up, Judgment was awarded against him. Personal service was effected upon him by the order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claim Court in accordance with the provisions of the Act and regulations of the small claims court. This means the Respondent did everything that she was directed to do by the small claim court and the Court did what it was authorized to do under the Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the respondent, the Court was not prepared to interfere with this finding of the self-proclaimed 'godfather of the South' (the appellant's mother). HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs of $139.35 to the respondent. 1)It is in the nature of nature justice that a judgment is issued. It does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. The Court must also view the respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to. In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small claims court as it is in Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse. 2)There was no reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra, that the appellant was notified as to the date of the hearing, which was one day after the actual hearing, but he chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts relating to the sexual assault of the complainant. The Crown alleged that the accused, who had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant, intentionally touched the complainant's body or with an object contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and for a sexual purpose touching directly a part of the body of the person under the age of 14 years, contrary to ss. 152 and 151 of the Code. In addition to the four counts concerning the alleged touching, the court also considered the fact that the complainant was between 10 and 15 years old at the time of the offence, and whether the accused intended the victim to receive the communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, coupled with knowing the communication was for sexual purpose. The accused was also charged with two counts relating the sexual assaults of the two children. The essential elements of sexual assault were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S. 330. HELD: The accused is guilty of both counts. The evidence is not credible. While the Crown may have had a reasonable doubt as to the accused's intent, the Court had to consider the external consistency of the evidence as well."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of their temporary guardianship order in Alberta. In 2005, an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child, the appellant temporarily re-located to Calgary and put herself forward as a potential adoptive parent. On the same day that this permanent guardianhip order was granted, it was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order, under which the respondents became the guardians of the child. The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. The appellant appealed that order. She sought fresh evidence limited to portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Section 83 of the Act permits an appeal of an adoption order. The judge was entitled to dispense with the mother's consent if she did not appear at the hearing. However, the court was satisfied that she had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. The right to be heard is a principle of natural justice and the test for admission of fresh evidence on appeal was set out by McIntyre, J., writing for the Supreme Court of Canada. By allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the application court, it would be appropriate to decide whether the reference to access in the private guardianhip Order is an 'access order' or 'access provision' within the meaning of s.78(6) of the act. 2)The court would make no comment on the merits or that she's intended submissions to that court. Additionally, the Court will decide whether to grant the appellant a hearing."

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that the caveat be reinstated retroactively, it would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in the new land titles system. The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Township Two (2), in Range Four (4), in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, were entitled to the caveat.

d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The plaintiff loaned $69,000 to the defendant, who was registered business name of the defendant. The defendant denied the loan was a loan, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto brokering business. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a taxable basis. The evidence showed that the defendant had agreed to repay the loan in a number of transactions, including one involving the plaintiff repurchasing equipment that the husband had lost in bankruptcy and gifting it back to the plaintiff. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. The cheque was not in evidence and there was no evidence that any of the payments made were made with the plaintiff's signature on the cheque. It became moot when the plaintiff testified that she did not have taxable income on the balance of the loan when she made the decision to pay the defendant's costs."

c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 resulting from a fire which broke out in the Kelsey Campus in January 1997. The defendants were advised that the plaintiffs were not there when the fire first started and that they were not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses. When asked what portion of the wall had been covered by a fire stop, the respondent conceded that the answer was 'the northeast corner of the Tower.' That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 26 to P. 300, Line 1) The question asked was what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. The answer appears to be asking for the plaintiffs' expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question is too vague to answer In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v. Board of Education). The plaintiffs' objection that the defendants were really asking for an expert opinion would seem to be borne out by the portion of testimony that was provided by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to all relevant facts but not opinions. They are entitled to know what was observable to anybody looking at the wall where the Soprema was applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was actually observable, for example what chemical change took place. Those are not factual questions. The observations, the factual observations made in the report of January 31, 1997 are privileged. The only thing that could be said to constitute discoverability is whether the plaintiffs received the statements during the course of their investigation. If not, they are privileged and the defendants will have the opportunity to examine the City of Saskatoon in the third party claim. 1) There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to a question of that nature when reference is made to document. The Court was unable to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2) The plaintiff was not required to answer the question posed by the defendant. 3"
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender was 52 years old and had a single, dated conviction. The issue was whether there was a reasonable possibility that he could eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation rather than the more serious dangerous offender designation. HELD: The offender is a high risk to re-offend violently in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger.  1)The offender has serious health problems. As result of a congenital heart disease, he required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had a stroke. He has been entirely unresponsive to treatment and in considering his risk for future violence, his risk is high. 2)There are two additional events that are germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed by a psychiatrist. In reviewing his case file, it is pertinent to note that the offender has expressed a desire to continue working in scaffolding and that he has expressed an interest in working with other people in his life. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is a superior court of criminal jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is able to determine the probable nature, frequency, and severity of any future violence caused by the offender because he has not taken the kinds of programming available via the Federal Penitentiary System and because there is a reasonable prospect that he will continue to perpetrate acts of violence such as these despite having completed significant remedial efforts and being in good health."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The plaintiff was not owed an amount on the mortgage and that it would likely receive a significant cash payout on sale. There was no evidence that the defendant, Alberta Ltd. (the mortgage company) directed to the land qua farm land such that it could reasonably bring it within the statutory purpose of the SFSA as considered in Christie, supra, and in particular Part II. The Christie case had no application as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land was the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. These activities bracket the commencement of the FMI action. The argument that the Christie case was a nullity in that the land was purchased by a developer for development, was being developed at the time this action was brought, and neither at that time nor since has there been any realistic involvement in farming so as to trigger the provisions of SFSA and so engaged the legislative intention of providing farm land protection. It was not intended that a developer, by leasing a parcel of land in the circumstances, could gain the protection of The Farm Land Security Act."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the respondent and Joshua's prolonged absence in Canada. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine whether the child is habitually resident in the United States or Canada. 3) The petitioner has demonstrated he has right to custody and therefore meets the obligation under Article 12. As have concluded the child's habitual residence is in Connecticut, the relief under the convention is triggered. The debate is moot as conclude the statutory definition of habitual residence under The Children's Law Act, 1997 is not in conflict with the case law developed under The Convention. 4) Rather than engage in lengthy debate with the Central Authority in Saskatchewan, the parties have been ordered returned. 5) The concern over chasing orders, at the Supreme Court level, was rendered academic by way of undertakings given by the father not to take physical custody of the child upon his return to Canada until Court in that jurisdiction permitted."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the HRM. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). At issue was whether the court had jurisdiction to deal with the issue of whether the plaintiffs were bound by the provisions of the collective agreement or not. HELD: 1)The issues were matters which fall within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the TUA.  2)The nature of the dispute arises from theinterpretation, application, administration and potential violation of the terms of collective agreement. Accordingly, the plaintiffs are bound by s.35(7) and s.40 of the Trade Union Act. S.41(b) recognizes an exception where the cause of action, in substance, is addressed by the legislation and collective agreement, and the extent to which the court's assumption of jurisdiction would be consistent or inconsistent with that scheme. 3)There was no question that in substance the dispute, the dispute was one of the legislation, not collective agreement matters. It was not suggested or contemplated that neither the court nor the parties had jurisdiction in the subject matter. The principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal apply. 4)In addressing the limits of court jurisdiction, including where the union declines to proceed with an individual employee's grievance or settles it against the employee's wishes, the court is to inquire into the complaint and to do all things necessary to ensure compliance with s.34. The plaintiff's rights as police officers under the Police Act are individual as opposed to collective rights. Whether the Order violated terms and conditions of employment once an application for certification was made pursuant to the collective agreements is a matter to be resolved having regard to the procedures for such a resolution established in the applicable labour relations legislation. 5)The plaintiff's claim that s.41 and 42 of the TPUA did not apply to them because they were employees of the plaintiff's bargaining unit but rather constituted former police personnel of various municipal units and at the time negotiations for a collective agreement commenced in 1996, they were not employees of HRM at all. 6)The statements of claim should not be struck out. The court reviewed the various factors in Pleau v. Nova Scotia and concluded that they had jurisdiction. 7)The respondent was awarded costs of the action against the plaintiff. 8)The court was prepared to take the appropriate approach when there was a threshold question."
5_1991canlii4241.txt,"The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was an appeal of a decision which overturned the respondent's claim that the applicant was not a party to a voluntary recognition agreement. Dismissing the appeal, that (1) there was sufficient ground to grant an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid ordering the Minister to exercise his discretion under s. 107(4) of the Trade Union Act. (2) the respondent misinterpreted a point of law and gave rise to the review of the decision by the appellant.) This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. It arose from a decision in Boyd Garland v. International Union of Operating Engineers, which was upheld on appeal. (3) in this case, the Minister of Labour and Manpower took the position that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent's income was reduced from $43,386.34 to $42,386., and his proportionate share of child care costs was $226.00 per month. The petitioner sought to have the access portion varied so as to provide for access every Saturday evening. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)Once a change in circumstances becomes material, the question becomes whether there has been any material change in the respondent's circumstances. The material does not satisfy the Court that there have been any changes in his circumstances since the pre-trial conference. There has been no material change."" 2)The respondent was to pay the petitioner an amount that was different from the amount that would be determined in accordance with the applicable guidelines. If the level of child support was simply an agreed upon amount the question was whether there had been a material change within the meaning, means, needs or other circumstances of either spouse or of any child who is entitled to support pursuant to s.15.1(3) of the Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Section 15 of the Act provides for an order requiring a spouse to pay for the support of any or all children of the marriage. This application was brought just ten months after the Pre-trial Conference. It is evident from the affidavit material filed by both parties that there is a substantial and ongoing conflict between them which affects their ability to make arrangements with respect to the parenting provisions in the agreement. 3)The parties agreed to impute income of the respondent to be imputed in the table amount based upon his imputed income. His taxable income in 1998 was $44,386 and in 1999 it was estimated at $40,386, and in 2000 it was anticipated that it would rise to $48,000 by the time the judge made his variation order in 2000. There had not been material change to either his taxable income or his circumstances as a result of either of the parties' failure to pay child support in the manner requested. There would be material change if the amount was varied. The alternative is that it is simply an ordered varying, rescinding or suspending, prospectively or retroactively, (a) support order or any provision thereof on application by either or both former spouses or by any other person."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as a result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The evidence demonstrated a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town of Martensville. 2)The plaintiff was correctly identified as the plaintiff's daughter. She was not given clear instructions to disconnect the water. She did not request the water be disconnected and accordingly no signature was required or obtained on the back of the form. Neither did Ms. Isaac advise the power was being shut off."

Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. A written victim impact statement was filed by the accused on behalf of the victim and the defendant also filed as exhibit a photo of the accused. The defendant minimized his involvement and culpability for the offence, and made an order in Form 5.03 authorizing the taking of the number of samples that were reasonably required for the examination. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, plus a fine of $1,500.00 plus one year probation with strict conditions.  1) The aggravating factors in this case were that the accused participated in gratuitous violence without any real explanation for doing so. 2) The nature of the offence itself is aggravating. The accused minimized his responsibility for his actions in the pre-sentence report and the fact that the assault occurred at his home. The Court found that a fine would be appropriate, but only if the accused paid a victim impact surcharge of $225.00. 3) Taking into consideration both the aggravating and mitigating factors, the principles of sentencing, the facts and the circumstances, the court could not conclude that incarceration in a facility is an appropriate disposition in the circumstances. The principles of justice, s. 732.1(5), and s. parity demand similar sentences. In this case, the offence was committed against a person who had been employed consistently for all but two years since his fifteenth birthday. He is a father and has accepted his responsibility to be financial and emotional support for his daughter."

The Crown agreed with the Crown that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order.

The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The respondent filed an application for an order varying child support orders.

The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This is an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation.

The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence.

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when, without warning, he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.

Rather, it was necessary to specify the misconduct upon which the cause of action is said to give rise to liability. 2) The injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the defendant's assault were serious but not life threatening. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment would be required in the future. The plaintiff had some minimal scarring and disfigurement but found that it was not significant.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of whether the defendant had jurisdiction to determine the entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)The issues centre around the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination. In addition to this claim, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. 2)The plaintiff was hired by the defendant in 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park. Prior to being hired, he was paid $45,000 per year comprised of salary, salary, benefits and one-half of his truck allowance. The defendant argued holiday pay should not be included in any computation of holiday pay, as the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the LSA and therefore not entitled to overtime. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff would be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage. 3)There were several preliminary issues to be dealt with. First, the defendant asserted that the plaintiff should be considered to have waived holiday pay for 10 years. The plaintiffs hours of work were very flexible in the winter. If the court finds that the defendant's holiday pay is not all-inclusive or if it does not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 4)It would be contrary to public policy for the defendant to appear to endorse the plaintiff’s actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and salary and to rebut the presumption in accordance with some exception in the Act. The court reviewed the various LSA definitions and found that the definition does not include an expense allowance. 5)In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He also asserted that holiday pay to be payable on the award assessed by the jury as damages in lieu of notice. In the alternative the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his right"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, and s. 11(c) and (d) of the Charter. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The accused were found not guilty of all offences under s.300 of the Code.  2)The impugned legislative provision had an objective of pressing and substantial concern. The Court must balance the value of freedom of expression against the reputation of the accused. 3)The principles of free and democratic society, including respect for the inherent dignity and worth of the human person, were at issue.  4)To warrant prosecution the accused must be sufficiently serious to require the intervention of the Crown in the public interest. The threshold test for the application of s. has been met. 5)S.300 is of sufficient importance to justify an infringement of s2(b). The actus reus elements of the s300 offence are publication of a false statement that is defamatory. 6)Section 309 and 311 are not relevant to this charge. 7)There is a rational connection between the objectives of protecting the privacy and reputations of Canadians and the limitation on free expression as guaranteed under s 2(b)Of the criminal code, s303 is the limit prescribed by law. 8)Section 301 is the exception to the requirement that criminal charges must be tried in the context of the broad range of offences. 9)The Court must consider all expression potentially restricted by s300, not only the expressions involved in this case. 10)The applicants were awarded costs of the application."
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on him while he was working on his truck. The plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued. This defendant had joined together with the plaintiff's other action in nuisance and negligence to determine whether the defendant had a duty of care. Dismissing the action with costs, that the plaintiff was in sufficient proximity to the defendant to expect that it would be reasonably maintained.

d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to me. Counsel for the appellant and SGI have agreed that the calculation is correct. 2) SGI has correctly calculated the respondent’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. If it is greater, the respondent has the benefit provided by s.117(4). 3) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the weighted average approach used by SGI in calculating the IRAs for the post-accident IRB, beyond noting that the income replacement benefits available for the benefit of others pursuant to section 159 could not be less then the amounts Montgrand was receiving. 4) Counsel for Montgrand sought solicitor-client costs. It was agreed that Mr. Abrametz had been paid a fee on solicitor and client basis and that his fee would have been paid if the claimant was successful on appeal."
4_2004nsfc6.txt,"The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The applicant brought an application to find that the respondent had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. The applicant had known the respondent for some time and had stayed over at his house alone with him. There were very serious allegations, the Court found. The evidence of the complainant's alleged sexual assault had more probability of truth than disbelief. The Court found that the accused had sexually assaulted a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is high (on a balance of probabilities) the Court adopted the position that was adopted in J.L. v. CAS of Halifax v. Attorney General of Nova Scotia (2d) 437. In determining whether or not the allegations of the Complainant are probable peripheral evidence, the court looked at whether the respondent committed the alleged offence and whether the allegations were impeached."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders since the separation, but all jurisdictional requirements had been met and a Divorce Judgment would be issued forthwith. The petitioner had taken out plans through employment to provide coverage for the children, with the primary residence being with the mother and the day to day care. The parties had separated in 1995 and had not had any financial stability throughout their entire 14 year cohabitation or since. The respondent indicated that he hoped to confer term insurance or other benefit upon the petitioner, but that he had not yet received the benefit. The evidence showed that the respondent's employer paid what appears to be $6,000 per year for medical and other benefits separate from the post tax deductions for long term disabilities, paid for directly by the petitioner. In addition, the respondent paid $1,800 per month for holidays with his sons. Access costs were entirely and solely the petitioner's responsibility and he should not incur expenses in any event."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after it was found that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the appointments were made. The defendant solicitor subsequently wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations, claiming that he was not aware that judgment had been entered against him, that he would need the appropriate conduct money, and that he had'some difficulty' with the appointed date. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The defendants were found guilty of contempt of court on the basis of the non-attendances made. 2)The date was unilaterally set as a last resort because of the complete lack of courtesy and co-operation shown by the corporate defendants. This was not in the best interests of the plaintiff. The defendants were expected to promptly file their defences and to proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it was eventually determined. Regrettably the defendant solicitor, in his duty to more than just his clients, has not maintained the level of courtesy & professionalism that is to be expected of a member of the legal profession."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant and respondent were parties to a collective agreement which established employee salaries for the period 1994 to 1996. The subsequent legislation rolled back the collective agreement and froze public sector salaries. The respondent sought to have the matter struck because it thought the payment would contravene the Act. The employer applied to a Chambers judge to strike the respondent's statement of claim on the ground the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and the employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and directing that the action be stayed pending submission to arbitration, that there was an issue regarding whether the letter of 1994 was an ancillary document and that it must be examined and determination must be made to see whether it is part of the collective agreements. This was not an issue that could be addressed on an application such as this one."

The complainants had made a complaint to the appellant, who was employed full-time and was not a user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with them. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence, which resulted in a substantial breach of the complainant's evidence. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that in assessing the evidence the trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony, and found no error. He sentenced the appellant to nine months in prison followed by 2 years probation. The sentence on the first count was 1 month straight. The appeal was dismissed.

There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal to be allowed, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial.

6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(1) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff alleged the defendant interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract by threatening violence, making gestures and other obstructing the workers conducting the harvest operation, so that the harvesting work had to be stopped. The plaintiff applied to terminate the attachment order on the basis that it was not required to secure the party who obtained it, as there were no grounds for the order, or there were other good reasons for termination. The applicant argued the court should consider the extent to which the plaintiffs' businesses had been disrupted by the action brought by the defendant, the fact that the plaintiff had not made sufficient efforts to bring the claim to final determination, and the existence of one or more grounds of attachment as set out in rule 49.01(1).HELD: 1) The affidavit did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. 2) The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The defendant had not established any principled basis to justify the maintenance of the order.  3) It was unnecessary for the plaintiff to delay the execution of the action."
6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at 2:40 and 3:01. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. The document consists of preprinted form and is made up of pre-printed words and underlined blanks. There are five alterations of the preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks on the document. Each of these changes consists of changing the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, Parliament has the power to deem things to have been proven regardless of whether the question is one of fact or of law. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not possible to know who made the striking out of the word and symbol 'Breathalyzer®' and the writing in of the 'Intoxilizer' and there is no symbol with it. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure that this was done. 2)The accused's argument that she did not adequately designate the model of the approved instrument was not supported by the evidence. 3)There was no evidence that the accused blew into any of the instruments designated for the purposes of identification, nor that there was any evidence that she was qualified to make this argument. There was no medical evidence as to the alcohol level at the time of the samples taken, no reference at all to the name of the instrument, and the proof would be made by stating simply that the said sample was received directly into an instrument approved for this purpose, section 237(6) of the Criminal Code. 4)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The Court noted that R. v. Gilbert (1976), 31 C.C.C.(2d) 251 (Ont. C.A.) was specifically not followed in Saskatchewan. It was unnecessary and inappropriate for the Court to comment upon those issues."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledges an obligation to pay child support and there is an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent’s Line 150 income for child support purposes was $112,871. There was nothing in the evidence before the court that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis.  2) The company in issue is in its startup phase. There is insufficient evidence to establish what cash is available and whether it could be withdrawn without impeding the ongoing operation of the company. The corporate cash flow statement showed very little cash available for distribution. 3) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be costs in the cause."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The Landlord appealed. Appeal allowed; the tenancy has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner. The reasons for withholding consent by landlord are neither arbitrary or unreasonable; in so failing to consider the Landlord's reasons, the Court believes the Residential Tenancies Officer erred in law."
e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT. At issue was whether there a change of circumstances, which would warrant a variation of the 2002 child support order; whether the 18 year old continued to be a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; does the father have an obligation to contribute to his daughter's riding lessons; the father's income for child support purposes; should the 17 year old son's s.7 expenses be increased; costs. HELD: 1)The daughter had ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and the father's obligation to provide on-going support and his contribution for s.7 expenses relating to her riding lesson terminated in March 2003. 2)The father shall pay $308 per month for support of his son commencing April 1, 2003 and every month thereafter so long as he remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3)The mother's application to increase the father's contribution for the son's extracurricular activities was dismissed. The father shall pay $54 per month for hockey expenses commencing June 2003 and every month thereafter. 4)The mother was to forthwith pay costs of the application fixed at $250.","FIAT. The husband sought to vary a child support order made in May 2002. He argued that his income had decreased as a result of his being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year, and that his wife had terminated her obligation to contribute to their son's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband's layoff was only temporary and had not resulted in a change in circumstance as required by s. 14 of the Guidelines. The unreasonableness of the wife's position warrants an assessment of costs. 2) The wife was entitled to her costs of the child support application in the amount of $54 per month for the support of their son. 3) The child ceased to be a child of the marriage in March 2003 based on the circumstances as set out in Zaba, Farden and MacDonald. 4) The father's income had increased since the May 2002 order. It was clear that the husband was currently unemployed, he had 'vague knowledge' of when he would be rehired. The employer had at all relevant times been Pow City Mechanical. The child had been in full-time attendance at a post-secondary institution. If any of these circumstances were established, it would result in a variation of the support order."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act.

The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply an adjustment to the owner's property. There is no doubt in the present case the first prerequisite is law. The questions as have recast them are clearly questions of law. For a question to be sufficiently meritorious to place before the Court either the judge hearing the application for leave must have a doubt, if not serious doubt, about whether the tribunal appealed from correctly decided the question or the question must be of such broad importance that it deserves the attention of and determination by a higher authority irrespective of whether the judge has any doubt about the correctness of the tribunal's resolution."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused had a lengthy record as a young offender and turned 18 two days after the commission of the last of the offences for which he was being sentenced. 2)The Court substituted a sentence of 12 months closed custody, concurrent with the 9 months open custody which he was already serving.","A young offender, who had been raised by his maternal aunt following the early death of his parents, escaped custody and took a truck from the parking lot of a residence. A police officer saw them in the stolen vehicle and, after speeding, including turning corners at high speeds, they struck the side of an attached garage. HELD: The disposition of five months was set aside and 1 year secure custody, again concurrent to the 9 month open custody sentence, substituted. 1)The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on B.D.L., a young offender following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. The four offences were: escaping lawful custody, contrary to s. 145(1)(a); (i) stealing property valued at more than $1,000; (ii) dangerous driving contrary to ss. 249(1(a); and s. 355(a). 2)The accused had turned 18 in October 1994.

The Crown was correct in characterizing the incident as technically a robbery which was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. What originally would have been a shop-lifting became more serious because of the altercation between the clerk and the appellant.","21 year old appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of armed robbery pursuant to ss. 343(d) and 344 of the Criminal Code.

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence. The wife also questioned the level of assistance offered by the trial judge to the husband who was self-represented at trial. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.",The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance from the respondent husband. The parties owned three separate properties at the time of the separation. One of the properties was purchased with proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property but broke down en route and was abandoned because the cost of repairs would have exceeded the value of the vehicle. The respondent husband cross-appealed claiming that the property was given to him by his sister and he overstated the purchase price of the property. The trial judge found this to be a palpable and overriding error and dismissed the appeal and the cross application without costs. Both parties' affidavits were found to be true. The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review as the evidence was readily available at trial and there would not be the same opportunity for direct and cross-examination related to the evidence which was available for the trial.
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The Court dismissed both applications for an order varying the child support order granted by the Justice R.D. Maher by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The Court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances of the child and that, given that the oldest child had expressed a desire to live with her mother, it was not change."
c_2015skca77.txt,The court denied leave to appeal. The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for seeding 1,050 acres. The defendant refused to allow the plaintiff's lawyer to refer to exhibit P-5 of the contract, arguing that it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the plaintiff. The court reviewed the relevant part of the transcript. The trial judge did no more than attempt to keep the trial moving forward and to require the defendant to answer the question that he had been asked at that point multiple times. 2)The trial judge made no error in weighing the central issue of law with respect to the issues of law. The fact that water washes might have changed seeding patterns or made seeding more difficult did not entitle the plaintiff to refuse to mitigate its losses."
9_2008nssc18.txt,"The defendant council, charged with the general oversight and administration of matters under the Natural Products Marketing Act, delegated certain authority to commodity boards such as the plaintiff. The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant Board applied for an order pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules 14.25(1) and 38.11 to strike two affidavits filed by the applicant regarding the applicant's failure to attend a hearing before the Council regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The applicant sought to have the affidavits struck as they raised a jurisdictional issue, which was not raised as an issue in the original application. In the context of the Council and other commodity boards, the issues raised were the relevance and general propriety of the drafting of the material and evidentiary issues of the nature raised in Waverley and Montagu v. Nova Scotia (1993), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 46 (SC). Dismissing the application, that there must in fact be a real dispute between the parties and affidavits are admissible, but they are not admissible on an application for certiorari. When it is granted on the ground of want of jurisdiction, or bias, or fraud, affidavit evidence is only admissible if the record does not provide enough information about the issues in dispute. Similarly with the application involving the interpretation of the law (Statutes and Regulations), affidavits were always admissible to show the record was incomplete, as for instance, that a conviction omitted the evidence of one of the witnesses. The merits of the case and the reasons for holding the'show cause' were never before the council."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for negligent misstatement and breach of contract alleging that the defendant negligently estimated the quantities of product to be handled under the contract and induced the plaintiff to enter a contract into which it was unable to derive anticipated profits and from which it incurred start up costs and operating losses. Defendant awarded $270,307.05 as damages for loss of profits and $10,000 damages for damage to plaintiff's equipment. Defendant's appeal was dismissed on the basis that the trial judge did not make any reviewable error with respect to the facts and that the plaintiff did not suffer any loss as a result of the termination of the contract."

They seek a revocation of the grant of probate and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. HELD: 1) This is a case in which the Court should exercise its jurisdiction to remove Evan as an executor. While the power of attorney may give him the power to make decisions for Evan in respect of legal matters, including instructing counsel, she was not entitled to represent him before the Court. By making the application he has, he is effectively stating that he is not prepared to give effect to the directions in the Will. The affidavit evidence satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do and thus he must be removed as an agent.  2) There is no evidence that either of Kent or Rodney have acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the will. Further, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly do their duty."

The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due. The judgment was also set aside on the merits. It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act. The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.","Civil Procedure – Default Judgment – AppealHELD: The plaintiff obtained a default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation, totalling $102,703.62 plus costs of $1,598.50. Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen's Bench Rules, Key's counsel now applies to set aside the default judgment and seeks leave to file a defence. The plaintiff was warned of the impending deadline and asked to continue to hold the funds pending a further order of the Court. Counsel for Key sought costs in any event of the cause on the basis that the default judgement was set aside ex debito justitiae. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim. Even under the Moir J. approach to the interpretation of s. 2(3)(b), the power of Council was not exercised 'pursuant' to the consent of majority of councillors present at a meeting. There was no meeting as required by the legislation. 2) In exercising the judicial discretion under Rule 9-13, the court must also conclude that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending against the action is insufficient to deny Key its day in court."

RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants. At trial, the court held their right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure had been violated, and acquitted them. The Crown appealed the acquittal. Per Roscoe, J.A., Chipman, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that there was no s. 8 breach because the respondents did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the field where the marijuana crop was growing. The court reviewed case law regarding 'open fields', and 'uncultivated' lands, and adopted the reasoning in Oliver v. United States, 104 S.Ct.1735(1984) in reaching its conclusion. Per Pugsley, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that the respondents had a reasonable expectation of privacy in activities carried on by them on their private property. As there were no exigent circumstances, the search was not reasonable and the evidence should be excluded.","The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana. The voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizure of 100 marijuana plants. The trial judge found that the police had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the area on which the plants were growing and thus were not entitled to the protection of s.8 of the Charter. He also held that the warrantless search violated the respondents' s. 8 Charter rights. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence was not admissible. The court adopted the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Katz v.

It may be admissible if its admission would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers, who were in attendance at the residence as a result of a fire, were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence had admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that it was too late to amend, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove the date of possession of the weapons. That was an error of law. The reasons for granting the motion were so inadequate that they did not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence."

The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to proceed with its action. HELD: 1) A delay of over five years is inexcusable and it does not reach the level of serious prejudice described in the ICC case. However, it is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delay.  2) The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim is comparable to that experienced by other cases in which the decision to dismiss is discretionary. As was the case in ICC, this case has now seen the completion of all pre-trial steps excepting for the response to certain undertakings given and still outstanding and the scheduling of pre- trial settlement conference. Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed without further delay. 3) The delay in excess of five years in advancing this case does constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.  4) The onus is on the respondent to convince the court that the facts and circumstances support the conclusion that the delay was excusable. The application for an order returning $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid is not granted. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made are live issues raised by the pleadings.

HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to section 253(b) and (a)of the Code. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat with his seat belt on when the accident occurred and he did not ask to speak to a lawyer. At issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a blood sample demand and whether the accused was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: 1)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the Court found that the accused had'reasonable and probable ground' to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court reviewed the principles it had established in R. v. Leedahl and reviewed Schnell's dominant or controlling purpose during the critical overlap period and held that once the accused rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(a), the court could not enter the analysis of whether the de facto care or controls of an inoperability motor vehicle was denied or infringed in any way. 3)The accused had reasonable, probable and reasonable grounds to believe (and in fact did believe) that the vehicle as contemplated by the Criminal code for the purposes of care and control was impaired by alcohol. The evidence established that the officer had probable and probable reasons to believe the accused could not provide a breath sample either because of his condition and the smell of alcohol from the vehicle; 4)There was no evidence concerning the accused's position in relation to the medical condition of the accused and no suggestion that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. Having found that such a belief is not supported by the evidence, the court concludes that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures at the hospital, including time in the hospital for an assessment; 5)The court also concludes that there is nothing in the language used in the authorities dealing with the death of an accused that would justify a demand for a sample"

HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months.","The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release.

He is now charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another serious assault. The Crown alleges that the accused has breached the conditions imposed at that time.

1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the PPSA applies to the applicant. Section 146(3) provides that an annuitant's account is to remain with the insurer and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a qualifying annuity or transferred to a registered retirement income fund authorized by the Income Tax Act. 2)The applicant had not retired and no pension refund exists. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s.146(2) and s.147(3). 3)The provisions of the Plan Contract and the arrangements in Phenix did not apply. The applicant's application for a declaration that the loan agreement was not in breach of s.57 of the Act and that the provisions in s. 146(12) and (13) were not to be tried in any fashion in accordance with s.148 of the Income tax Act, therefore no security interest exists. 4)The only exceptions were that Crown Life could attach the proceeds pursuant to the terms of the plan to its registered pension savings plan and that it could not collaterally claim the benefit of a pension refund when it revoked the registration. 5)The provision in the plans contract prohibiting any assignment or pledge of her interest under the Group plan and its provisions respecting an attachable pension refund were not dismissed. 6)Taxation was not involved in the application. 7)The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $12,000 to be paid to the pension trustee in the form of a letter to the effect that the tax provisions had been struck and the provisions respecting the pension refund which were not part of the contract. 8)Nothing in the plan contract or the IncomeTax Act prohibits the applicant from setting off her indebtedness to it against any monetary sum due from it. Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired, there appears to be a nomonetary sum current for Crown Life to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her."

The petitioner separated in October 2003 and agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the respondent. The respondent seeks to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and is opposed to the relocation of the petitioner to Edmonton. The issues on the relocation are whether it is in the best interests of the baby to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to have with the baby. HELD: 1) The respondent has the child's primary residence in Saskatoon. The child will have access to that residence every day. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the baby's care in Edmonton, the court finds that it is not in the children's best interests to move to Edmonton where the respondent will be an access parent. 3) There is ample evidence that the psychological bond between the respondent and the child is lost if the respondent is allowed to relocate. 4) The evidence on the respondent's ability to access the child at his parent's home has been ample. 5) It is not necessary for the court to deal with this as the parties declined to allow the relocation. 6) The court reviewed the factual background in Rosenau v. Richards and found that supervised access was no longer required."

The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing to the Minister three children. The Department of Social Services had been very much involved since the birth of the oldest child. The Minister had previously ordered the three children to be permanently committed to him. At the conclusion of the hearing held to inquire into the matter, the decision was reserved to permanently commit the children to him; however, pursuant to s. 37(2), the order was also reserved to an open adoption. The children were all children of and L. The mother was diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been placed on medication. Over the years, there have been a number of occasions when the children have been removed from the home to protect them from violence and disharmony in the home when drank.

There was evidence that the children were in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi). There were other instances that showed that the mother simply did not recognize the children's needs and did not want to be the parent. She chose alcohol over both and children."
c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: 1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the Court found that the tapes were of central importance to the mother and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home.  2) The tapes were primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The keynote theme, as orchestrated by the father, is that the mother is deranged and violent but the father will always be there to rescue the children. The children have no fear of either parent. 3) After listening to the tapes in their entirety, the court was of the view they have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the respondent advised the brothers that they should become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. They invested in these partnerships in 1989 and 1996. In 1996, the Registrar in Bankruptcy granted an ex parte order directed against the petitioner, his wife, and their holding company, Ashton Holdings Ltd., requiring each of them to preserve and retain intact and in specie various market securities (the Securities) previously owned by the petitioner pursuant to an alleged security interest granted in her favour by the respondent. Ashton filed notice of disputing petition in August 1996. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they becomedue. It was common ground that the respondent paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation was offered for his failure to pay his obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven. 2)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court refusing to issue a receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner's clients as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him.  3)No adequate explanation had been offered by Ashtonfor his failure or refusal to comply with his obligations under the Act.  4)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Court that Ashton is indebted to them in the amount of $1,000.00."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendant’s monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred by misapprehending facts when he found the defendant did not advise him of changes to his circumstances and by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Saskatchewan courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)Canadian courts have not followed Frey. In his decision regarding the 2006 consent order, he held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to s.17 of the Divorce Act. In this case, the court referred to the decision in Frey Frey (1987), 1987 CanLII 4734 (SK CA), RFL (3d) 154 (Sask.) at para 12. The court reviewed the various orders of the Court in the past 10 years and found that: 1)The Court found that the parties had not reached an agreement on the extent to which the defendant was entitled to vary his consent order in accordance with the Guidelines; 2)There was no evidence that either party was aware of the material changes to their circumstances; 3)The defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of the 2009 material changes or to have adjusted his child support accordingly. 4)The court found that a consent order can only be varied if it is necessary to change circumstances. 5)A spousal"
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the decision of the trial judge in relation to custody and access. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child. He addressed it as required by law.

2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant. The charges all arose out of the same incident. The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information, which would all be applied over to the other information. The Court found that the accused were both the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant and then punched her in the face. The rear window of the car was smashed in. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281.  1) The actions of the accused and the manner in which they were attacked were aggressive and the accused took necessary and lawful action to protect themselves and their family. There was no evidence of an essential element of the offence which was supported by the testimony of the main accused. 2) The two accused admitted to breaking the front passenger window and he probably broke the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. 3) The Court accepted the accused's testimony that they were involved in a fistfight and that the altercation was unnecessary and it was unnecessary for them to use force. They both admitted to getting involved in the altercation and that they both felt threatened.  4) The accused admitted that he choked the complainant at one point during the fight and that he punched the complainant three times. The complainant's testimony was contradicted by the other witness who testified that she had been drinking alcohol at the time of the altercation.  5) With respect to the count of wilful damage to the car, the Court agreed with this procedure. The trial proceeded on information 24614281 and at the close of the trial the Crown and defence evidence was applied to and became the evidence on Information 24417999.  6) The injuries were consistent with fistfights. The defendant was aggressive. She punched the plaintiff three times and he fell off the stairs towards the trailer.  7) The evidence submitted by the accused was that they got into a fist fight in the parking lot of a strip mall. There were lots of punches and kicks by the two accused and they were standing up and punching each other. The plaintiff was forced to walk away from the scene of the assault. The accused choked the plaintiff and he was punched three times while he was standing on the stairs.  8) The court found that although the accused may have been involved in an unnecessary altercation, they were not involved in"
c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the appellant's evidence, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt. The court applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence."

At the time of this agreement the marriage was already in difficulty.","This was an appeal from a corollary relief judgment dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost on double Column V. 1)The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant met the order with the result that it ceased to contravene the Code. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. 2)The appellants appealed the decision of Matheson J. to this Court on essentially the ground that he erred in failing to find that the board had exceeded its jurisdictional jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant applied to have the Court of Appeal dismiss his summary judgment application on the basis that the chambers judge erred in the application of the test for summary judgment. The chambers judge admitted that the defendant had provided conflicting statements regarding the dog and the fact that it ran onto the highway. The defendant argued that there was no arguable issue to be tried on the application and dismissed the application. The issues were: 1) which affidavit was read and signed by the defendant; 2) which evidence was attached to the affidavit; and 3) which portions of the defendant's discovery evidence, including the statement of the officer who had examined the dog at the scene of the accident, were not properly presented through the other affidavits. The Chambers judge did not refer at all to the real chance of success test; and 4) the onus did not shift to the plaintiffs to show that their claim had a real prospect of success. All of these issues were dealt with in the chambers decision."

The respondent has costs at double Column V. The considerations to be applied in a leave to appeal application is 1)whether the issue raised by the proposed appeal is sufficiently important to the litigation before the Court or to the practice in general to warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal. 2)Whether the applicant's proposed submission to the Court of Appeal has sufficient merit to warrant the granting of leave. 3)Whether there is any delay in the proceedings which would be caused by the interjection of an appeal.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held"
b_1997canlii11375.txt,"The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The defendant cannot now insist that this was an essential and fundamental term of the contract which would entitle him to rescind the contract. 2)The plaintiff received a copy of the executed agreement in the mail. The post office was a legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and to this extent the postal acceptance rule is satisfied. If the defendant is now seeking to break the contract, he must insist that it be expressly stated in the contract before he executes the same. 3)There was a valid contract between Johnson Seeds and Farr. The parties communicated in person, by telephone, by fax and by mail. There was no evidence that in the telephone conversations between the parties they discussed the issues of supply and demand, the impurities and hulled seed count were established by the defendant in accordance with procedure and standards used by the Canadian Grain Commission and included as foreign material. 4)Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that the contract was in breach and this is when damagess would be assessed."

HELD: The provisional order was confirmed but the monthly child maintenance was reduced from $300 per child to $50 as the respondent earned approximately $12,000 per year gross. Based on federal guidelines she would be required to pay $142 for the two children but had unusually high costs for exercising access as the former husband lived in Alberta.","The Maintenance Enforcement Office reduced child maintenance from $300 per month to $50 per month for the following reasons: based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00 permonth to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia; however, the respondent has unusually high costs forexercising access as she lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and the former husband lives in Calgary, Alberta.

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. A trial before a Queen's Bench judge had issued a judgment dealing with the division of matrimonial property. In issue was the return of the list of items that the petitioner had found missing from the home. HELD: 1)The Court had previously varied its judgment to deal with the relief sought by the applicant on the ground that no formal extension of the judgment of December had ever been issued. The Law permits the Court to vary its judgment and give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. 2)The prayer sought variation of Clause No. of the notice of motion. Section 3(a), (b), (c) and 5 of the prayer for relief were amended to include the items listed in said list. 3)The respondent had not even unpacked a good part of what he took away. Since the respondent did not want to cooperate, the Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and its still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that its evidence should not have been introduced by the Crown, nor should counsel have referred to the theory in summation. Defence counsel should have raised a timely objection. The court found that the still photographs and the R.C.M.P. analyst's opinion were not properly admitted into evidence and that, in light of the fact that they were not being introduced at the criminal trial for this purpose, it would have been a reasonable choice not to object to their admission."

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.",The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The R.M. council was divided into two factions and the plaintiff moved a motion to tender the contract for building inspection services to the defendant. The defendant opposed the motion and sought legal advice from the plaintiff's legal counsel as to how to handle the issue respecting the perceived conflict of interest. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The restriction placed on the plaintiff was not in her personal capacity. She was free to discuss municipal issues with the ratepayers in his division and within the municipality and with the media and others.  2)She acted with a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. The issue was best dealt with at municipal election. 3)The defendant was acting in good faith in providing advice to the plaintiff. The plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did.

The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence.

HELD: The application was granted. The court reviewed the pleadings drafted by the self-represented plaintiff and found his claims had no reasonable prospect of success and struck them.,"HELD: SaskTel brought an application seeking an order striking the defendant's Statement of Claim under Rule 7-9(1)(a) of the Queen's Bench Rules on the basis that it discloses no reasonable claim and for an order for costs. The claim against SaskTel has no reasonable prospect of success. The statement of claim contains the following information: 1) the plaintiff was last employed by SaskTel in a temporary position (term) that lasted from April 2, 1990 to November 30, 1990; 2) the defendant states that it appears that the plaintiff's Claim may allege that he was injured at work during his time at Sasktel, while the defendant does not admit this fact, if the Claim is allegedly based on such injury, then the Defendant pleads the Workers' Compensation Act, 2013 R.S.S.; and 3) The claim apparently is about events from 1990 and therefore any claim is statute barred under the Limitations Act. SaskTel was awarded its costs. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to SaskTel. 1) On an application to strike, the facts set forth in the Statement of claim are considered to be true unless manifestly incapable of proof. It is incumbent on the plaintiff to clearly plead the facts upon which he relies in making his claim. 2) The pleadings carefully reviewed the pleadings. The plaintiff's claims against Sasktel have no reasonable prospects of success and should be struck. The pleading or other document disclosed no reasonable defence. Where it is obvious that the only possible claim is for workers' compensation benefits from the WCA, the claim does not disclose any reasonable cause of action against the Defendant. 3) If the circumstances warrant and one or more conditions pursuant to subrule (2) apply, the Court may order all or any part of pleading or document be struck out; the conditions for that order to be met are that the pleading or any document discloses a reasonable claim or defence, as the case may be; one of the conditions set out in Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 (CanLII), [2011] SCR 45; and 4) the amount of damages claimed."
d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude this evidence. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code, whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence before me leading to such a demand. HELD: 1) The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the accused has alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 2) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonably reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make formal breath demand. The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. Even if one could construe this passage to require a 'consumption alone' to be sufficient, it does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in body. 3) The legislation has removed the process from the consideration of the degree of impairment that is displayed before the demand is made. The test is consumption alone and not its amount or behaviourial consequences. The legislature's priority had removed the processes from the process of considering the degree impairment displayed prior to the judge's consideration of impairment. The court was persuaded that, prior to making the demand, the peace officer must reasonably suspect that a person who is operating a motor vehicle (or who is engaged in any one of the other named activities) has Alcohol in his or her body. If the officer forms the required suspicion, he or she may make a demand that the person provide a sample of breath for analysis in an approved screeningdevice. 4) The officer's objective was not raised in view of the fact that there was no mention of alcohol being detected on the breath samples provided at the scene and at the detachment, she declined to exercise her rights to counsel. 5) Although there was some evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car, and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle, Objectively,"

e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or in installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category.  1)There had not been a material change in circumstances as the petitioner and respondent had agreed upon the division of the Canada Child Tax Benefit and GST, the manner in which the tax returns were calculated, the standard of conduct of the parties and the hardship occasioned by the release of their judgment in July 2006. 2)The respondent had been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children since the commencement of these proceedings in 1999. 3)The petitioner had not caused any hardship. The respondent had accepted $380.00 per month for all of the children. 4)There was no agreement or obligation to disclose the income tax returns for the past 3 years. The petitioner was not seeking a variation of $380 as she was not disclosing her income tax return in 1997. 5)The court dismissed the application for retroactive child support. Section 25 of the Guidelines provides that courts must strive for a holistic view of the matter and decide each case on the basis of its particular factual matrix. The Supreme Court of Canada reasoning in DBS was applicable. 6)The applicant did not provide any reasonable excuse as to why support was not sought earlier other than concluding the respondent accepted less than the amount set out in the guidelines."

HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"The parties were at odds over the issue of who was at fault as matter of law for the collision and subsequent damage. The ultimate disagreement was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff and service costs in the proceedings. HELD: 1)This was one of those rare cases where the scales of justice were evenly balanced. The evidence, taken together with the exhibits, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability in this case because it was at the end of the day equivocal. It could not support either version of the events put forth by the parties. 2)The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his claim had been proven. The physical evidence does not assist as a matter of fact because it could support either versions of events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively. However, it does not detract from either version. 3)The court was unable to conclude that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) In this case, the trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the fact the police officer was not called to testify. She said it might appear extremely relevant that he was not brought forward to testify on the critical issue of identification. However, the jury was to consider on a common sense basis whether it was likely that the appellant could have outrun the driver of the white Tempo. It was also to be determined whether the appellant had been driving the vehicle at the time of the offence. The Court noted that R. v. Cook, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1113, indicated that the broad discretion enjoyed by the Crown in the prosecution of offences, including the offence of trafficking, should be set aside. This case did not have the potential to be a'mug' case but rather was one that properly instructed a trier of fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered."

Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13. The defendant earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the reduced assessment in March 1997 but in September 1997 the utility and review board issued a refund to the plaintiff. In September 1997, HRM issued a property tax refund cheque to Canada Trust. Canada Trust applied for the interest on the amount overpaid and sought a return of the refund as soon as the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act had been exhausted. A rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4%) was the appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March/97 and the payment of the property tax refunds in September/97 as well as on the unpaid interest until the date of judgment.

The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody.

The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused has an incredible criminal record. It is lengthy and continuous, commencing in 1979 and running to the present. There are 121 convictions, 39 being for property offences, 50 being for fraud and several for non-compliance with court orders. HELD: The accused has been in custody on the subject charges for two years and eleven months. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. In the result, the following sentences were imposed: COUNT 2 Incarceration for 2 years and 6 months, consecutive to the preceding sentences and a Payment surcharge waived as the accused had no income and would not have any for some time. 1) The conduct of the accused is most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while he was in prison. It extended over 18 months; involved many separate acts; and required participation by several individuals with the accused as the co-ordinator. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was a long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. It has eliminated the necessity for many people to testify and go through the consequent discomfort. 3) The principles of sentencing remain and did have the assistance of the two cases cited above. Denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, must be emphasized and obtain a priority. Any other approach would be detrimental to the administration of justice."
d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act and holding that the respondent had been negligent in failing to give notice of his assignment. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The trial judge held that s. 88 of the Act was applicable and set aside the provisions which prohibited an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of a commercial business. He concluded that the sum owing by the respondent was the property of an Indian on a reserve and that if the respondent gave notice he was entitled to the funds held by the Shubenacadie Band on the ground found by the learned Chambers judge. The appeal allowed on the basis that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between the respondent and the defendant finance company meant that there was nothing owing to the respondent at the time the book debts were assigned to Snyder.

6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in a building damaged by a fire in October 2007. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location. In May 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the premises and sought production of all documents relating to the second fire, specifically: a complete copy of investigative files prepared by government authorities, the Town of Stellarton Fire Department, any photographs of the aftermath of the fire, any internal investigation, any of the file of any insurers who carried out investigations and any files of any insurance company that carried out investigation. The defendants argued the documents were relevant to the action. Dismissing the motion for production without further evidence would only serve to sanction a fishing expedition, as stated in Murphy vs. Lawtons Drugs Stores Limited, 2010 NSSC 289. As a result the motion is dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant in the amount of $750. plus disbursements, payable forthwith. In issue was whether documents related to the subsequent fire in May 2009 at another location were relevant documents that occurred in this proceeding as it relates to the issue of negligence. The party seeking production has the onus of establishing its relevance. Rule 14.08 contains a presumption of full disclosure of relevant documents. The presumption is rebuttable. Rule 15 imposes a duty on defendant to disclose the plaintiff's documents. This requires motions judge to decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. Brown vs. Cape Breton Regional Municipality, [2011 NSCA 32]Rule 14.01 provides that relevant and relevant documents have the same meaning as at the trial of an action or on the hearing of an application and, for greater clarity, both of the following apply on a determination of relevenancy under this Part: (a) judge who determines the releviancy of document, electronic information, or other things sought to be disclosed or produced must make the determination by assessing whether a judge presiding at a trial or hearing of the proceeding would find the document relevant or irrelevant; (b) a determination is not binding at the beginning of the action or at the end of the application and (c) the determination is relevant and irrelevant.

This is to be contrasted with the access proposed by the father for the upcoming 2 months which would see the children not having overnight access or indeed, any access, to their mother during four 6-day periods until the appeal is heard.

The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08.

The Crown obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Peace in January 2009. The warrant resulted in the blood samples being taken from the accused. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain blood samples contained sufficient grounds in support of the warrant, whether the information was a reasonable grounds for an accused's right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter, and whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were admitted into evidence at trial. HELD: 1) The officer who signed the document admitted that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the accused, who had been driving his vehicle that early morning, was involved in an accident and was in no condition to consent to taking samples of his blood. 2) The information which the officer had deposed in the document was not a reasonable ground for the accused's belief that he was the driver of the vehicle. The information to be admitted was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant.  3) There was no breach of the accused’s s.8 rights pursuant to the Charter. The officer did not omit crucial ground for his belief, namely that the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol. 4) There were witnesses at the scene of the accident who observed the accused lying face-down on the ground in front of the car. 5) The evidence heard on the voir dire was that the officer swore the information before the Justice of the Peace at 3:30 a.m. on January 10, 2009. He did not include the source of his belief that the driver was not wearing a seat belt or that the buttocks to be situated on the side of the body were not in the vehicle and there was no evidence of anyone fleeing from the vehicle after the accident.  6) The affidavit material did not constitute reasonable grounds of belief for the officer to have sworn. 7) The fact that more detail can lend greater credibility to an information than a boiler plate does not mean that the information must be more in the nature of a finding of fact. There is a factual element to the information which must be considered in order to permit the Justice to determine whether there are reasonable grounds that the warrant could not have been issued. 8) The Certificate of Analysis and the Report by the Analyst were not"

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Family Court which held that a lump sum payment made under the Family Maintenance Act could not be varied after payment.

HELD: 1)The present shared parenting arrangement was to continue until the mother was available for full-time child care. The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him. Both had full time jobs. 2)When the mother assumes sole custody the father must pay child support of $226 per month and proportionate share of horse riding lessons ($28 per month).","FIAT. Both parents wanted sole custody of their son. Since they separated in June of 1997, the boy had lived alternating weeks with each parent. HELD: Sole custody was to continue until the mother withdrew from the workplace.

A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired.

The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the government claiming that a pension was not payable. The defence of the Crown's defence that the plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding was pressed pursuant to s. 111 of the Pension Act. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired and the plaintiff now had the opportunity to pursue civil action.

The vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia but was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August 1990, an assessment was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for dependent benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had died while he was performing work duties at the University of Saskatchewan. The respondent Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the applicant was not advised by anyone that she might have any potential entitlement to benefits from the Board as result of the death of the applicant; and third, that there were no life signs at the time of the application. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard. 2)Section 45(1)(b) does not bar the board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' (see Baker v. Canada). 3)The principles of the law and workers' compensation principles in general, particularly those relating to the use of the term 'found dead' in reference to the deceased, were reviewed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in its decision on November 20, 2002.

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The court granted the judgment and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to participate in the program. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce are present. The matter will therefore proceed to trial. The court has not dealt with the issue of the petitioner's participation in wrestling. This child is now 5 days old and the other children are still infants. The respondent indicated she would be the primary parent with the children. Arrangements to express breast milk while the child is being breastfed were made in order that the petitioner could be in contact with the baby while in his care. In addition, the petitioner was ordered to have additional parenting time with the two older children (ages 5 and 6). The petitioner sought to have the oldest child (now one year old) enrolled in a private program with an emphasis on social interaction and the development of the child. The second child (aged 1) was also included. The petitioner was granted custody and access on two of the three parenting issues. The third child (ages 1 and 5) was already enrolled in the private program. An application to vary the existing parenting arrangements was made in light of the state of the family property."

He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","An appeal against a 6-month term of imprisonment and a 100(1) prohibition order having regard for the principles of protection of society,punishment, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.

A 10-year firearm, ammo and explosives prohibition order was made against the appellant pursuant to ss.100(1). 5)The sentences were varied to correspond to the time already served."
2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment.HELD: 1) The separation agreement clearly favours the mother. All jurisdictional elements have been proven. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2) The parties agreed in the interim that their child would not be removed from his home and that their agreement of joint custody would not affect his mobility. 3) The father agreed to pay child support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances of the parties lives. It is clearly unequal favouring the wife. There was no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. 4) The mother was to have sufficient income to run her business. The parties had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. 5) The respondent was to assume all his business expenses including business tax, fees, insurance, 100% of his motor vehicle expenses and travel. The respondent had no reason to exclude any of his personal expenses from his allowance. 6) The petitioner had the benefit of a matrimonial home which she planned to rent in the coming year. She was to receive a capital cost deduction of $10,625 for an annual income of $22,878. 7) The court reviewed the net earnings, purchasing and net profits of the respondent and the paternal grandparents. The court found that the respondent had a conscientious choice in that he did not seek to limit his access to the home and was prepared to give his equity in the home to assure that his child would remain in the area. The paternal grandparents had similar interests in keeping the petitioner and her child in the jurisdiction. Thus the agreement as see it was signed had become an issue that requires review. The Court ordered an increase in access."

The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence which was to the effect that he was suffering from a panic attack, raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)G.A.D. is caused by a sedative deficiency in the brain and is related to depression. 2)The accused has been diagnosed as suffering from general anxiety disorder. The symptoms of this disorder must be manifest for at least 10 minutes before a diagnosis of panic attack can be made. 3)The medical evidence did not support the accused's diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder or that his evidence and the evidence and evidence of the doctor raise a reasonable suspicion as to the possibility of him being in such an attack."

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court which held that she had committed the act of public mischief when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible. The appellant applied to have the respondents pay for the preparation of the appeal book and certification of the approximately 1,700 pages of transcript she had typed herself or, in the alternative, allow her to file all required materials electronically, including uncertified transcripts. The respondents' motions to dismiss her two appeals and to have them pay the cost of certifying the transcript were granted. The Court dismissed the appellant's motions for dismissal on the basis that they had failed to comply with Rule 90.40(2) of the Rules and the motion for the respondents' payment to certify the transcript. Given that the dismissal of her Criminal Appeal prevents the appellant from having the merits of her appeal determined, which she makes clear are of vital importance to her personally and which she believes are also of great public importance because they involve finding that she was Not criminally responsible with respect to the public mischief charge, no dates have been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appealed because of her seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that on April 27, 2002, he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)On the evidence, the accused did not show any signs of impairment. His blood alcohol concentration was at least 140 milligrams percent. 2)The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 3)The Court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence to the prejudice of the accused.  4)The accused's blood alcohol content was at or near.08. The Court gave careful consideration to the evidence of the alleged erratic driving and the accused's explanation for it. The accused's response in stopping was delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during 2 minutes. 5)There was nothing unusual about the accused driving on a divided highway in light traffic. He was exceeding the speed limit and had failed to signal lane changes, which he made in an abrupt manner as he passed the only other vehicle in the immediate vicinity. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. He did not display any mental confusion or noteworthy inappropriate behaviour. He conducted himself in a rational and reasonable manner."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","This was a motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the mother asked for a dismissal of the matter on the basis that the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. Because the trial was scheduled to start tomorrow, the agency had no opportunity to reapprehend. Counsel for the mother made a motion that based on the rule in B.F. I had lost my jurisdiction and must dismiss the matter. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)The time limit preceded the disposition order and the trial court conducted the trial prior to the statutory overall deadline and, with 13 days left within which to implement its jurisdiction, made a disposition order purporting to last months. The trial court could have made such an order for the 13 days remaining; but because the order was to last beyond that 13th day, it acted without jurisdiction. 2)The Court had not lost its jurisdiction in this matter and, it will commence tomorrow."

While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The victim of a car robbery was found in the car with the gun and stolen property, in the company of two young men who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and a gun and number of items reported to have been stolen in the robbery. The gun was found under the back seat of the car, loaded. The victim was not asked to implicate the victim directly but said that he had been picked up in a building somewhere in Fairview and it would beg the question as to why he was doing that and what else he might be saying that was not true. HELD: The evidence of the victim’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that the police officer was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the officer was just wrong. The evidence established that the person who was picked up by the police at the scene of the robbery was not the person they had picked up. There was no direct drive from the address in Sackville to the place on Northwest Arm Drive where the car was stopped. The police officer said nothing about stopping anywhere. The crime was committed in high risk take-down and the descriptions of the men who were in the vehicle matched the description given by the Crown witness. It was logical to assume that the accused, who had not been in the courtroom when the police stopped the car and who had been there when it was stopped, was one of the people who picked up the stolen items."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully harvesting forest products and found that it should have quashed the sentence. The conviction was upheld on the basis that there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the illegal sale of the wood was not the subject matter of this appeal. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. On the factual grounds, the standard of review is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. The defendant was found not guilty on the trafficking charge because the evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. The appeal court may allow a Crown appeal where, although not properly convicted on an offence, the defendant was convicted of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, but only for the purpose of determining if the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge's conclusion."
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008. The contracts each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The respondent sought to have the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The IDSL was the primary operating agreement and was automatically renewed for successive 3 year terms, unless either party cancelled the contract in writing at least 60 days prior to the renewal date. In this case, HAL took the position that the IDSL, as amended by the SCA and ESMA, did not impose an obligation on the respondent to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, HAL's claim was dismissed. HELD: The application was dispositive. Even if the conclusion in that respect had been different, the court would still not have granted leave. 1)A term permitting an appeal from an arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying' in the factual matrix of this case. 2)HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators’ decision, and the application must be dismissed. If the right to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the agreements, then the court does not have licence to reconstruct the contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. 3)The use of the word 'final and binding' in this sense is not akin to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, but rather reflects the intention of the parties and the very limited nature of potential appeals. 4)The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which an appeal would be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. The degree of generality (precedential value) indicates that the parties turned their minds to the question of dispute resolution, which, except on that very narrow issue, intended to allow the arbitration panel to reach a final decision. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording."
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She claimed a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit the windshield of the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor trailer. The experts filed by the defendant remained uncontradicted and the plaintiff failed to adduce evidence to support their allegations. The court found that the defendant was not and never had been liable for the accident and that the accident occurred because of his failure to observe the standard of care and because the evidence did not support his allegations of negligence. Further, the plaintiff did not provide any further evidence respecting foreseeability or causation and argued that her discovery evidence was not bare allegation, but a material fact that if accepted at trial would give the plaintiff a real chance of success."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love seat in the living room adjacent to where the children often stayed up at least until midnight. The accused frequently came up to the complainant and touched her legs, buttocks, breasts and vaginal area. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had touched her buttocks only once and then fell on top of her. The complainant said that this was because he tripped over her younger sister who was lying on the floor. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. 1)The evidence tends to confirm the complainant's testimony. 2)The accused is not guilty of all of the offences. He is not a person who is prone to paranoid delusions or paranoid delusions. He has explanations for his behaviour. There is no doubt that he is a sexual predator. The only person who would have been more likely to believe him is the accused himself. The circumstantial evidence of paranoid delusions and paranoid delusions is not sufficient to confirm his allegations. He would be wrong to assume that all the evidence surrounding his behaviour and those of his ilk, including the sexual assault allegations, is circumstantially supported by the evidence of other sexual predators. It would not be appropriate for a Court to take judicial notice of his outrageous behaviour and the fact that he was drunk at the time he was charged. Although the accused is from Saskatchewan and raised in the province, his evidence is that he has always lived in a house that is near the residence of his estranged wife. The Court would be remiss not to take this evidence into account if it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his behaviour was dangerous and unconscionatory, bordering on paranoid, and bordering on psychopathic, both of which would be supported by evidence of his psychopathic and sexual immorality. The Judge would not have taken this evidence seriously and would have done more to confirm and confirm the accused's allegations than any other expert witness in the area of sexual behaviour."

He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was born of the marriage. The mother was the primary caretaker of the children and her role was to report to the father final decisions about the children's education, health and dental care, and their relationship with the father. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, plus the pre-marital pension benefits. The parties were to obtain a date on their docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and whether, as a result of that analysis, any change is required to the terms of the order. Children to be in the joint custody of the father and mother. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses in respect to the serious and damaging allegations was credible. It was possible that, after careful review of all of the factors in s9(a), court would come to the conclusion the full table guideline amount is the proper amount of child support. HELD: 1)Section 9(a) requires the court to take the financial situation of both parents into account. The provision does not include a conclusive formula to determine how the table amounts are to be calculated. The role of the court is not to determine which parent is better but to decide which plan for the child's care will best meet the objectives of their children. The court retains the discretion to reduce parent's child support downward from the Guidelines amount if there is no indication the parents would likely overcome the conflict that had arisen between them. 2)Costs in the amount of $50,000 are not to be determined on a case by case basis. 3)There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The evidence indicated that the father would not place the children in an inadequate care situation. 4)The evidence did not support the idea that the child needed counseling. 5)The court would not order counseling if the children were to suffer irreparable harm."

He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appeals his convictions for careless use of a firearm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public. He alleges the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result; (b) in finding it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances; and (c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest. Allowing the appeal on the basis that the appellant was a flight risk and that he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate, the court found."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)There will be instances where the defence will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation and there will be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  2)In Provincial Court it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. In the case of R. v. Kutynec (1992), 52 O.A.C. 59, 12 C.R. (4th) 152 (C.A.), the court dismissed the proposal. Rather than inventing structured procedures for Charter applications in Provincial Court trials, rather than using a rigid, time-consuming procedure, the trial judge is entitled to insist and should insist that defence counsel state his position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial. There is no evidence suggesting that the Crown should have these people to attend as witnesses if, in their assessment, the testimony of such witnesses is required in support of the application to exclude evidence. In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright.

Although the agreement stipulated that he live with his maternal grandmother, the mother paid his grandmother $400 per month for room and board and she gave an allowance. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in the east side, to accommodate what he understood was Michael's interest in moving in with his grandmother and Jerrilyn, his older sister. The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly caused their children. HELD: 1) The mother's income was $25,672.37. The father's proportionate share was 80% and the mother's was 20%. The current s. 7 expenses total $4,261.00 yearly. 2) The father was to pay $284.00 in December 2007 for the s. 8 expenses. 3) The parties were to produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s. to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is not necessary that there be a written agreement or court order to this effect before the onus can be discharged, the court should exercise caution in awarding child support in shared custody situations to ensure fairness. The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. 4) Costs in the amount of $500 are payable forthwith."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","A summary conviction appeal from a judgment wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely, that the appellant had been drinking, that he had bloodshot red eyes, his mouth appeared to be dry, he was rubbing his lips and he smacked his lips even when he was not talking and that, having worked with the appellant in the past, he had not been informed of his right to counsel when the tests were performed; and that observations concerning slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being permitted to drive constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The learned judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who testified at the scene as to the appellant's level of intoxication. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not an admissible evidence at trial as evidence of impairment, there is no inherent improbability in the observations concerning the impairment of the accused. The observations were corroborative of other symptoms of impairment that were noted by the police officers. 3)The appellant could say with his limited exposure that the accused had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and his speech was lacking in any detail and he was as well smacking his lips. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the trial judge."

The employer argues that the plaintiff was dismissed for cause. HELD: 1) The employer spoke to the employee on three occasions about her work and by his own admission, the employee made an effort to improve. At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

The plaintiff was to receive employment income of $2,592.00 and would have received holiday pay in the amount of $149.56. 2)It was well established law that section 43 of the Act provides a minimum notice period and does not prevent an employee from seeking remedy at a common law for breach of contract. 3)The relationship between master and servant there is implied in the contract of hiring an obligation to give reasonable notice of an intention to terminate.

The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","Electric, a closely held company, sued the appellant in 2004 for accounting, damages and injunctive relief.

e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","The Crown applied for a review under s. 679 of the Criminal Code when the appellant at the time of the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. A written decision granting the release with conditions was issued on the same date as the amended order. The appeal was slated to be heard January 26, 2000. After reviewing the decision of Justice Cromwell and without any new precedents being provided by the Crown following an opportunity to do so, and on the facts of this case, the court decided that it should not exercise its discretion to grant the release without a review. Allowing the release, that the court misinterpreted the definition of custody by granting the 679 application and that if a review was ordered, the issue of whether or not a person on a day parole is in custody would never have arisen. At the time, the appellant was serving his time in custody in penitentiaries. Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to section 679(1) of the Code, the Crown issued a written decision on October 19, 1999, granting the released with conditions. The release was pending the appeal of the Crown's application for judicial interim release of the appellant, who was on a parole application, was not in custody.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The Agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the Agency for several years and that there had been a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of her safety was at risk because of her repeated moves in the family. The psychological father was considered parent or guardian pursuant to s. 36(1)(b), s. 45 and s. 46 of the Child Protection and Custody Act. HELD: 1) The child remained in the Agency's custody subject to protection finding. 2) The agency did not make an order removing the child from its care. 3) There was insufficient evidence to determine the seriousness of the consequences of the agency's decision. 4) The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was on the Agency. It was a civil burden. It must have regard to the seriousness. 5) There were no reasonable changes in the circumstances. The child was not in the physical care of her mother and the mother was with her grandmother until after court proceedings. She did not have access to a computer or the Internet. She was not involved in any of the child's medical needs or any other child care needs. The parents' relationship was complicated and there were a number of issues that had to be addressed."

There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The applicant was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. On November 12, 2002, he was arraigned on the information (sworn to September 29, 2002). He entered not guilty plea and requested the first available date for trial (December 18, 2003). It was anticipated that one full day would be required as the Defense intended to make a Charter motion and lead evidence. The accused waived the delay or part of it such that the remainder is not unreasonable. The court found that prejudice can be inferred on the basis that the length of the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered, given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge found that the lease agreement did not fall within the type of rental agreement contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act and that the responding plaintiff failed to show that his claim had a real chance of success. Gilbert also appealed to the Supreme Court alleging that the judge erred in granting Chrysler's motion. Appeal dismissed. The material facts were not in dispute. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff, while driving the leased vehicle, was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries and the insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Act, s. 2(ak) and s.2(ak), which permit a person to rent a vehicle without the owner's permission and to have the rights to do so with the express or implied permission of the owner. Both issues dealt with vicarious liability at common law. The appellants and the respondent both argued that the Chambers judge erried in failing to apply the law in Bazley v. Curry, [1999] S.C.R. 534, and the law that has developed since that case was decided. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the appellant. 1)The Chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts.  2)The lease agreement fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.'  3)In Bazley, supra, the Court was addressing whether non-employee/employee relationship was a situation distinct from a'rental contract' as defined in s 62. Further support for the Bazley decision can be found in s. 61, which falls under the heading of 'For Rent Cars'. 4)In this case, the appellants, Gilbert and the defendant were involved in a motor vehicle accident. Gilbert sued the appellant, her insurer and Chrysler for compensation in respect of injuries she sustained in the accident. The defendant was not acting as a servant or agent of Chrysler in the operation of the vehicle. The Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by the Act. 5)There was no evidence that Chrysler exercised the high level of control that is required in a rental"

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving in a manner dangerous to the public. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The court found the accused guilty of both counts. The evidence of the accused that he did not strike the complainant was overwhelming. The Crown must prove both the mens rea and actus reus. The criminality of the misconduct lies mainly in the accused’s intention.  2) The accused admitted to hitting the complainant in the face. He admitted purchasing one gram of marijuana and then driving the truck dangerously close to the complainant while she was laying on the driveway. There was no evidence that the complainant fell on the ground or that the accused got aggressive and kicked the complainant on two occasions. However, the evidence of tire marks which were consistent with the injuries sustained by the complainant when the accused backed up the truck and came forward on more than one occasion and hit the complainant with his fist. 3) The Crown was found to have proven the guilty count beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. It was not possible to conclude that the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time the mother and father abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia. The child was to have his access time for the remainder of August, pursuant to the terms of this decision. The mother acknowledged this to be the case.  1) Given the facts of this matter, it was in the child's best interests to lift the stay imposed on the sentence under Rule 15(1). This, in many cases, puts the incentive on the father to perfect his appeal, should he still wish to do so. 2) The fact that the matter has the potential to give rise to more problems than it does address, the stay is lifted. 3) There can be no harm to the child or any significant disruption in his life if the stay were lifted. There was no evidence that the father would be better able to facilitate this need in the best interests of the child. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the access to his mother and sister especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern."

The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants, McMillan LLP and Michael Friedman (collectively 'McMillan'), are two of the defendants in the within action commenced by the proposed respondent, Melvin Schneider (the representative plaintiff). In his statement of claim, the representative plaintiff pled that he and others suffered financial losses due to negligence by the defendant. The Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The respondents then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and Rule 49 of the Supreme Court of appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(C) application. They raised the following grounds in their proposed notice of appeal: 1) the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to properly apply the Ann's test or by failing to consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty of care applicable to the individuals; 2) the tax opinions provided by the lawyer were essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim at this juncture; and 3) the judge cannot be said to have erred by not taking these factors into account when dealing with the Rule173(c)."

She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voirs dire but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the bag were incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. Pursuant to s. 9 and 8 of the Charter the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. They are not required to establish a prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest. There must be a valid objective served by the search.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent has not paid any s.7 expenses since Justice Dickson’s September 23, 2004 order. In addition to ongoing support for the parties’ oldest child, Corry and the two youngest children, he also ordered that he pay 66% of the child support expenses for the 2006/2007 university year.  In addition, the petitioner requested that the s.8 expenses be adjusted for the 2007 university year and that the respondent immediately pay his 66% share of the girls’ dental and orthodontic expenses.  2) The petitioner also applies for an order to be paid for ongoing s7 expenses. The sole issue is the amount to be fixed. FIAT: It was noted in the affidavit that Corry had indicated that he would have good idea of the 2006 university year by September 2006 but that the costs relating to the computer were legitimate s7 costs and the crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense. The Zellers supplies, however, would normally be covered under Table support. Accordingly, that expense was disallowed. 3) The Court found that the petitioner had not provided a detailed estimate of the costs for the 2005/06 university year as provided in the consent order.

8_2003nspc17.txt,"The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid. Application dismissed; there was sufficient evidence to constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. Overall the nature of the evidence was compelling with four separate and independent sources all confirming either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold at his residence; although individually none of the sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforced and confirmed each other; and the police conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by the sources.","The defendant made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. HELD: The application was granted and the evidence obtained by the search was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. The police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance which corroborated the information provided by their sources."

Failure of the police to lay a charge against the attacker did not disqualify the applicant from compensation if it was otherwise supported by the evidence.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Services Act. He alleged that the police investigation had indicated that they would not be proceeding with criminal charges. Because the program was unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that you were a victim of a crime, we were unable to make a compensation award. The appellant appealed.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother called him early in the morning with the news that there had been a police raid on the home she shared with the accused. The police found two guns, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. The accused was charged with possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Criminal Code. At issue was whether the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms. HELD: 1)The accused was presumed to be innocent until the Crown proved he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The evidence collected from the accused was that the sawed-off shotgun and ammunition were found in a box in the master bedroom of their home.  3)Evidence collected through various case management conferences and the assistance of the Canada Firearms Centre had not been dispensed with.  4)Although evidence collected at the scene of the search had been considered at trial, it was not accepted that the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 5)There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones that were located in the other two individuals’ home. The evidence collected through the course of the trial was that of a witness. The witness’ testimony did not meet the burden of proof and there was no suggestion of a continuity problem.  6)Evidence obtained through the destruction of the evidence and the exchange of photographs between the parties was not considered relevant to the charges. 7)Statutes of the Custody and Interpretation of the Evidence and the Access to Information Act were not to be relied upon. The Crown and the accused were jointly responsible for the search of the premises. 8)The Crown had not established that the contents of the three guns seized were a prohibited device within s. 84(1) of the Code and a section of Part II of the Regulations. 9)Countries were not required to accept the evidence of the persons who possessed the firearms at the time of their arrest. 10)Counts were not issued pursuant to the Part VI authorization.  11)The essential issue on the firearms seized from the victims was whether Kyle had constructive possession of them.  12)"

The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations.

Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital.

This stay was granted in 1995 and the Hearing Committee met intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time for firstly because the court had imposed a stay and then because the criminal matters were still before the court.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. The first proposed basis is that the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days would be admissible on a basis that the accused's decision whether to testify would more likely than not be the same in relation to both sets of counts. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. The interests of justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. Whatever use was made of the firearm on April 8 would not touch on who might have had knowledge and control of it on April 14. The videotaped statement to police was common piece of evidence to both events. On an application to sever a multi-count indictment, the overarching criteria are the interests and justice of justice. It is important to note that Litchfield, where the Crown was prevented from arguing the case properly because of an unjudicial severance order, does not necessarily be a better ground of departure for the accused because of the multiplicity of offences and the fact that the interests, especially in the context of justice, require a trial on one or more of the counts."

Both Shiplack, supra and Stomp, supra are exceptions to the general approach that is to be maintained unless there are compelling reasons not to do so as were found in both cases.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The parties lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the outset of this relationship, the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. sought the continued intervention of the Agency. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child, who had run from her mother's home and stayed with her paternal uncle in [...]. The Agency applied for a protection order from Nova Scotia which required the children to be placed in the custody of T.B.'s common law partner, who was to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children who had been apprehended by the Agency and who became the guardian and foster parent of the children, respectively. The protection order was dismissed in February 2006. The children were placed with their father, who lived in a supervised care home with his sister, who in turn remained with the mother until her death in December 2005. The father did not participate at the disposition review, although he participated in previous hearings. HELD: The court found that the information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the agency's decision. It would appear that the Agency was responding appropriately to the children's current situation. The court ordered the supervision order to be dismissed as the Agency had failed to take proper steps to protect the children. The provisions of the Children and Family Services Act provide that no person shall publish or make public information that has the effect of identifying a child who is a witness at or participant in a hearing or the subject of proceeding pursuant to the Act, or parent or guardian, foster parent or relative of the child."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that, on or about August 21, 2003, he did commit a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed summarily. The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew of the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The complainant was flabbergasted by the charges and believed that there was never ever any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. 2)The accused gave his evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. He was vigorously cross-examined. While his recollection was not perfect and his evidence was not consistent on every point, believe that he did his best to relate his evidence as accurately as he could recall it. 3)There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21 and the same cannot be said about the events of August 21."
e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant applied for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: Application dismissed. The applicant does not have the resources to discharge this liability now, nor in the next several years. He is entitled to relief under subsection 178(2)(g). The debt in effect can't be cancelled or affirmed. Counsel for the AG advised that it does not question the applicant's good faith with respect to the loan. Accordingly, the court will only review what find to be evidence respecting the other requirement under this subsection, whether his financial difficulty is so extensive that he will be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan; it would take many years to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability."
6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The father of two little boys claimed that the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor were wrongfully accused of physically and sexually abusing him. HELD: The Court dismissed the application for variation. The Court held that the information communicated must be reasonably appropriate in the context of the circumstances existing on the occasion when that information was given. The purpose behind the legal action was to bankrupt the wife so that she would be unable to oppose an application by the father to change the joint custodial arrangement. In the best interest of the children, the trial should never have taken place. The allegations of physical and sexual abuse were found to be entirely without basis in fact. The evidence did not support the allegations of abuse by the mother. The co-defendants, who had obtained a consent order directing compensatory Christmas access to the father, committed libel and threatened to libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father. There was insufficient evidence to establish the mother was negligent in the preparation of the reports."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being chartered by Air Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. HELD: 1) The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike a statement of claim as disclosing no cause of action. The defendant, SkyService, is vicariously liable for the acts of the defendants, as they acted throughout in their capacity as employees of SkyService and/or as agents and designates. The defendants deny any negligence, breach of contract or unlawful confinement on their part. 2) Although no specific case law was provided to the Court with regard to the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with respect to its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. British Airways which involved a claim against a commercial passenger airline and package tour operator arising from a crash landing. Although the claimants had no right of recovery against the defendants in relation to purely psychological injuries, liability was established against the tour operator for psychological injuries not because he was not covered by the Convention but because of the express terms of contract as between the plaintiff and the plaintiff which allowed for the recovery of such damages. The Court should be reluctant to deny a plaintiff his or her day in court."
d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.","FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support as well as an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children? The mother sought retroactive support for the time period from February 2006 to February 2007. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had an entitlement to interim spousal support, the father did not have the ability to pay; the Sylvan Learning Centre costs were necessary and reasonable; the mother's evidence disclosed that both children were in need of a specialized educational program given their current problems at school; the father's share of both childcare costs and the Learning Centre expense was equal to 71% of the total cost. HELD: 1) The Court was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father had not taken steps to research alternative programming.  2) The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. 3) The father was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400. 4) The court ordered that the cost of preparing the application be divided equally between the mother and father. 5) The cost of providing the child with access was $1,650 per month. The Childview program costs for Kody for the summer of 2007 were $7,800 per year. The childcare costs were included in the child's annual income and income for the father at $37,900 and the mother at $13,085. The father's portion of the child support payment would be $960 per month, with his proportionate share being equal to 72% of total cost; and the school fees were added to the total costs.  6) The child was in a half-time program for students with learning disabilities. The mother had commenced making reasonable child support payments in the fall of 2006. Although the father was not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance, he did not provide any evidence regarding the payment of loans by the father during this period of time and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered by him was resolved. If the mother wished to pursue retroactive matters she may do so when and if this matter proceeds further to pre-trial. 7) In the matter before the Court, the Court found that s. 7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was directed to give priority to child support in determining child and child support applications.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand a class of some 6,000 potential claimants, none of whom have been given notice of the interpleading application or of the application. The argument that Ag Credit has advanced premiums on behalf of its clients and thus any overpayment of premiums arising under the contract are its property is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients' class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as a class are entitled to receive the surplus, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involve the interests of other persons. 3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate manner of addressing the issue of entitlement to the surplus funds, the evidence available to the Court clearly indicates that the insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by Ag Credit that it has paid premiums directly to it. The insurer may apply ex parte to the court for an order for payment of money into court, if any, as it deems necessary, and make appropriate orders as to notice and procedure to deal with adverse claims. 4) While some of the borrowers may have defaulted in payment of loan obligations and/or related insurance premiums and Ag Credit may have chosen to nonetheless pay the premiums on their behalf, there is no evidence that this type of payment has occurred within the confines of the Act."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1 year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. His belief in the existence of photographs enhanced the complainant's credibility. There was some evidence that could amount to an error of fact but no miscarriage of justice resulted. 2)The court found that the trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist or by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone.  3)Although correctly articulating the test used in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the court was unable to conclude that his belief in that the appellant's evidence had influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 4)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and an order to be made in s. 686 are granted."
e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. However, the defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the produce department, and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by plaintiff. The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. 3)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, including the owner and occupier, had any reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' described in Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs Ltd. (1991), Maurice J. proposed a four part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care to an invitee. 4)There were no logs filed by the defendants prior to the date of the incident. If any, they were destroyed by the impact of the impact on the plaintiff. 5)No logs were filed with respect to the time the plaintiff had to vacate the premises to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve.  6)Statutes filed as required by the simplified procedure included the names and addresses of persons who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the events. Notes and medical reports were not filed with the court. Notes were not prepared for the purpose of this inquiry. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing which may have caused symptoms of PTSD. The Court found these factors to be aggravating factors but the respondent failed to take them into account in assessing her potential sentence. The issues were not in dispute. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and her previous criminal record included convictions for possession of a weapon and mischief as well as two convictions for not abiding by the conditions in her probation order. The parties agreed upon the range of sentences for manslaughter and the only cases referred to the court were Hathway, supra, and Schoenthal. The judge did not embark on an analysis of the kind set out in Laberge but that authority does not require judge to explicitly enunciate every factor considered in coming to his conclusion. The court found the respondent was found to have compelling personal circumstances that led her to commit the offence, namely, the trauma suffered as a result of the child's death, which included multiple fractures and blunt force trauma to the head, feet and head, which led to his unconsciousness and ultimately his death. These were mitigating factors but not sufficient to warrant a higher sentence."
e_2000canlii4625.txt,"The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into by the accused and the surety. HELD: The application for forfeiture was dismissed. 1) The surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s.773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  2) The accused has had enough on his plate and is experiencing enough negative factors to outweigh his jurisdiction. The court has concluded that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.

In issue is whether the Youth Court judge has the discretion to refuse to appoint counsel to represent a young person having regard to the provisions of s.11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. The meaning of the word 'unable' in s.11(4)(b) was in issue. The youth was facing a variety of charges including failure to comply with conditions of an undertaking; failure to attend court; possession of property obtained by crime; obstructing a police officer. He requested the Youth Court appoint counsel after his Legal Aid lawyer withdrew. Both parents were on social assistance. The matter was adjourned to investigate the possibility of an aunt providing financial assistance but the youth advised in April that she was unable to do so. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Youth Court judge did not err in refusing to direct counsel be appointed. The Youth Court judge's discretion is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. The youth disentitled himself to continued Legal Aid representation by his own misconduct.,"An application for orders of certiorari and mandamus concerning a decision by a Youth Court judge not to appoint counsel to represent a young person. The issue was whether the Court had discretion to refuse having regard to the provisions of s. 11(4) of the Young Offenders Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The judge did not err in refusing to direct the applicant have counsel appointed to him.  He had no jurisdiction to decline the request.  2)The Youth Court's discretion to determine inability is not limited solely to considerations of financial inability. Inability may be asserted for other reasons and the court is entitled to inquire into the foundation. In R. v. J.H. the young person refused to be represented by legal aid counsel and applied for court appointed counsel of his own choice. He argued he ought to be able to discharge his counsel without disclosing that his parents were both on social assistance and would likely be unable to provide financial assistance. The lawyer advised the court that his aunt was unable to assist him financially. The youth court judge asked why the lawyer did not stick with his Legal Aid lawyer and the lawyer replied that it was because he was messing up in court and not coming to court. Counsel for the applicant dismissed the application.  3)It has been held that once young people makes request of the Youth Court for representation by counsel the language of s.(4)(b) on plain reading makes it abundantly clear that the exercise of discretion is no longer an option and the making of an order becomes mandatory. 4)The young person without financial assistance could, ad infinitum, disqualify himself from legal representation by his own misconduct or discharge the counsel for whatever reason and insist on the appointment of substitute counsel."

The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed.

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and the tenant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the notice to vacate was served on the tenant. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith and believed that the landlord, Koch, had made an error in law in allowing her to move into his home. Koch denied any wrongdoing and argued that the Hearing Officer erred in law by failing to make an order for vacation in favour of the tenant and the landlord. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant was one of contract and did not create any interest in land owned by the tenant for the purposes of estoppel or otherwise. 2)The hearing officer did not err in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter a written tenancy agreement. Section 20 of the Act provides for a hearing officer to determine whether a tenant has the right to possess a rental unit pursuant to s.2(f)(i) and s.7(f) of the rental unit. Section 21 of the Trade Union Act states that a landlord is an owner's agent or another person who, on behalf of the owner, grants to another person the exclusive right of tenancy to rental unit for insurance purposes. 3)The Hearing Officer made no errors in law. The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. 4)Section 7 of the Charter gives rise to the term tenancy by virtue of the fact that it contains the standard conditions (e.g. the date and place of hearing, the address for service and the telephone number of the landlord or the landlord's agent) and the terms of an order respecting the right of a tenant to pay rent. 5)Section 8 of the Code provides for an order of possession if a dispute arises between a landlord and a tenant and if the tenant has a tenancy agreement with respect to certain specified rights or privileges. 6)Section 9 of the Common Law applies to written tenancy agreements. One of the factors cited in this case was the fact the Hearing officer had no jurisdiction to hear the matter. The Hearing Officer adopted the same words and phrases used in the following cases: 'tenancy agreement'; 'owner's agent'; 'lord' means landlord; tenant; landlord; agent. Section 7"

The father sought to reduce the support contained in the 1997 divorce judgment which incorporated the parties' interspousal agreements regarding custody, access and child and spousal support. The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed. A variation was warranted as there had been a change in the father's financial means and circumstances. The Guideline support obligation for two children is $341 per month.  2)It could not be concluded on the evidence presented that there was any special provision in the parties' agreement that directly or indirectly benefited either child. The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the respondent had custody of the children and the applicant had reasonable access on reasonable notice. The respondent waived any claim to further spousal support, subject to payment by the applicant of $500 per month continuing only until April 15, 1998. HELD: 1)A variation order would be made in accordance with the applicable Guidelines. Based on an annual income of $24,000 the applicant's child support obligation is $341 per month for the two children. However, s17(6.2) permits the court to make a child support order that is different than the amount that would otherwise be determined in such an order if it is satisfied that there are special provisions in an order, judgment or written agreement respecting the financial obligations of the spouses, or the division or transfer of their property, directly or indirectly benefit a child, or that special provisions have otherwise been made for the benefit of child; and that the application of the applicable guidelines would result in an amount of child support that is inequitable given those special provisions. 2)There was no change in the circumstances of the respondent or either child disclosed in the material filed. 3)The applicant had experienced a significant reduction in her income since 1997 and had been unable to obtain employment which compensated her at a level commensurate with that received while employed by the federal government."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent.

S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings which had been converted into apartment units.

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial, denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside. 1) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's testimony and finding that it did not raise a reasonable doubt are based on errors of fact.  2) The appellant's evidence about the involvement of Children's Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The judge ascribed to the evidence of the complainant's mother the relevance of this evidence. The inference drawn from this evidence could not have been more unjustified. 3) The trial judge misapprehended evidence. It may consist of a mistake as to substance or of a questionable interpretation of evidence that is not available to the court in law or in logic on this record. In the circumstances of this case, either use reveals a chain of reasoning unavailable to the law or logic on a record."

The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant sought to vary spousal support in accordance with the terms of their Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who is now independent of the respondent. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and the parties divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the respondent granted a corollary relief judgment incorporated into the agreement.

Both parties wanted a final agreement so as to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings. Retirement was contemplated by both parties and by the respondent assumed that she would be able to obtain a mortgage on a home acquired by the applicant but that was offset by the husband's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant.

There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 2)There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature.  3)The agreement was binding. There were no changes in circumstances since the signing. The husband was left essentially debt free while the husband was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. 4)There had been no material change in the circumstances of either party. The Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines were not law. The agreement was crafted to reflect the times and circumstances of each party.  5)There were no adverse consequences to the application in light of the new circumstances (e.g. the reduction in legal fees and accounting fees relating to the divorce proceedings and these variations proceedings) but it was a debt that was voluntarily assumed.  6)The applicant had the assistance of very experienced counsel.

As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, possession of proceeds of crime contrary to ss. 354(a) and 355(b)of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, unlawfully using or causing a forged document to be used, and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused sought a judicial stay of proceedings on the basis that he had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his right to be tried within a reasonable time. Dismissing the application for a stay, that the accused has not established that there have been breaches of this right within reasonable time, and society's interest will not parallel that of the accused. HELD: The accused's charges are absolute jurisdiction offences as per s. 553 of the Code.  1) The Court found that society as a whole has an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are treated humanely and fairly. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand for the accused to be brought to trial. 2) The accused does not have the means to justify an early trial. There is, by its very nature, a societal interest that is adverse to the interests of the individual. 3) In some cases, the accused doesn't have the necessary resources to ensure that proceedings take place while evidence is available and fresh. 4) The actions of the Crown, such as disclosure delays, change of venue applications, changes of solicitor, challenges to search warrants and adjournments which are voluntarily undertaken and do not count toward the unreasonableness of the overall delay. 5) There is also a secondary societal interest, which is by its nature adverse to interests of an accused."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.",The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a lawful excuse for failure to attend.  2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original impaired driving charge was stayed by the Crown. 3)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a constructive excuse includes all defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 4)The legislation could be amended to provide new excuses or excuses or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses.

There had not been compliance with s. 23(1)(b) of the Act. The notice to vacate was therefore ineffective and the consequent writ of possession was quashed.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event services are provided by the trucking association. HELD: Each case was dismissed.  1)The plaintiffs have constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The plaintiffs have failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. Even if the case on entitlement had been made out, the damages could not have been properly determined without further evidence or representation. 2)Each case is dismissed."

Eventually they turned the franchise back and sued for damages alleging that the Defendants had interfered in their attempts to sell the franchise and had wrongfully refused to consent to a sale negotiated by the Plaintiffs. The Defendants counterclaimed for unpaid royalties and rent. The parties each prepared and served their Statements as to Documents. Both parties then applied for production of additional documents under Rule 212. The Defendant also sought further particulars of certain matters referred to in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim under Rule 164. HELD: Applications allowed. Both of the parties were ordered to produce some of the documents requested. 1)A party must disclose all documents which may contain information which either directly or indirectly enables the other party to advance his case or to damage the case of his adversary.  2)The test of relevance on discovery is wider than that of admissibility at trial. 3)Documents brought into existence with the dominant purpose of using them in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation which is in reasonable prospect at the time of their creation are privileged. 4)Particulars are appropriate only (i)to enable a party to properly plead in response or (ii)to eliminate surprise. 5)The Court found that further particulars were appropriate in this case on the second ground, given the vague nature of the impugned paragraph in the Plaintiff's Defence to Counterclaim.","FIAT. The first plaintiff brought an interlocutory application seeking an order for production of documents by the defendants. The second plaintiff sought an order in respect to the plaintiffs documents. HELD: Application dismissed. Documents relating to the franchise agreement, lease, advertising, signage, and other documents were not privileged and must not be produced. The defendants had undertaken to produce these documents so that they could be seen by the public.  1)The affidavits, tapes, and licensee agreement were all found to be relevant. 2)The application was dismissed in any event of the cause. 3)The plaintiff was not entitled to compel the defendants to produce any documents other than the statement of claim. 4)The requested documents related to the history of the plaintiff corporation and its dealings with the operators of the franchises. 5)Any documents relating to advertising were deemed relevant. 6)The request was so broad and general that it would require the defendant to literally produce every piece of paper in their possession. Much of that would be irrelevant. 7)All agreements between the two defendants as they relate to the franchises and their dealings with other persons who were potential operators in the Prince Albert area or who actually became such operators were privileged and therefore admissible evidence. 8)Each party had brought an application and had been successful at least in part. The broad relevance as opposed to a narrow or strict relevance is the applicable test. 9)Any costs awarded would be off-setting. 10)The affidavit evidence was not relevant because the plaintiffs filed a defence and counterclaim and there was no requirement that the defendants reply to it. 11)The letter was not privileged as it contained a description of shortfalls and deficiencies. 12)The plaintiffs merely plead 'failing to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation'. The words'shortfalls and deficiencies' did not add much more. The plaintiffs should be able to describe with some clarity the nature and source of the shortfalls/ deficiencies along with the dollar value of same. This limited information will likely do much to avoid surprise and should therefore be provided."
c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT: Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant, Wal-mart Canada Corp., which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion by United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1400 which was added as a party with the consent of the applicant sought an Order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application. In the other motion, the union applied for an order dismissing the applicant's motion. HELD: 1) The relief sought by the Union should be granted. Although there is no admissible evidence before the court, it is reasonable to conclude that there exists a reasonable apprehension of bias within the documents. 2) The transcript of the radio broadcast was admissible. There must be nothing more than allegations by plaintiff in pleading the validity of which have not been tested. 3) The statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v. Government of Saskatchewan et al. filed in Saskatoon on May 10, 2006 meet neither requirement. There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is an equal problem. Since everything attributed to the Matkowski family has an aura of self-interest, it does not generate confidence in its reliability. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 4) The affidavits filed by the union do not meet either requirement. They are admissible by reason of s. 7 Saskatchewan Evidence Act Act, S.S. 664, c. C-16. Publications in The Saskatchewan Gazette and all copies of the statutes, the journals of the Legislative Assembly, sessional papers and all other documents printed or purporting to be printed by the Queen's Printer shall be deemed to be authentic and make proof of their contents without other evidence. 5) The admissibility of the articles and the transcript of 'John Gormley Live' radio broadcast is not supported by the affidavits. 6) Without any evidence of interference by the Department or interference with the Board, the statements and the presence of certain publications are not admissible to prove the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the articles. 7) The same affidavit was attached to an affidavit of one of the"
6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","This is an appeal by the Crown from an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent is unfit to stand trial. The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, misstated the evidence, applies the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. 2) The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations. He has not shown that he is capable of making rational decisions beneficial to himself. 3) In asking the court to adopt the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness to stand a trial, the respondent was asking this court to follow the test set out in R. v. Taylor (1992), 77 C.C.C.(3d) 551. 4) There are strong interests in an accused being fit to proceed to trial, and the public interest is in ensuring that persons who are accused of committing crimes are brought to justice. In this case, the public interests outweigh the interests of the general public. The respondent was charged with a total of 29 offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. Most of these were summary conviction offences arising out of multiple failures to comply with various bail conditions including: breach of curfew (five charges), failing to attend school, failing to reside in a designated residence, and failing to not possess, keep or consume alcohol (four charges). He was also charged with two indictable offences: two counts of breach of bail conditions and one count of obstruction of a peace officer by providing false name. 5) The Court concludes that the evidence of the Crown and the parties that the appellant is incapable of instructing counsel as he does not have the capacity to interpret the evidence and to present a rational decision. The evidence of a psychiatrist who assessed the respondent as having a high threshold for the ability to instruct counsel derogates from the fundamental principle that an accused is entitled to choice his own self-defence. The psychiatrist concluded that he would therefore be unable to instruct in a manner that would be in his best interests and that he, in fact, resist the assistance of counsel altogether.

On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and I reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. HELD: The matter was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. 1) Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.  2) Given the plaintiff's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over-the-conduct of their Counsel or against the counsel directly. 3) The two motions served on them were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by The Queen's Bench Rules; and in his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. 4) The plaintiff was under extreme pressure and stress lately with respect to the file and others and therefore had prepared three motions fairly similar to one another.

Defence now wants further disclosure of information that relate to those important issues. HELD: Further disclosure is ordered. The names of the drivers stopped will not be disclosed and the actual notes of the officer are not ordered to be produced.,"FIAT: The Court must guard against the pursuit of what have been termed 'fishing expeditions' --speculative quests for information without any real expectation about the outcome of the quest or its relevance to the case. Here, the defence has already indicated that issues around s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter will be raised at trial. The Crown will make timely disclosure of: (a) the number of stops made by the RCMP in each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; (b) the reason for each stop in the first place; (c) how many of those stops resulted in search for contraband, including narcotics; (d) Specifics of any other grounds for searches that were applied and how many times; (e) On how many occasions did the searches result in the finding of contraband; and (f) the actual notes of the RCMP officer. HELD: The Crown shall make timely and extensive authorities. The notes will presumably supply some details of the required disclosure as ordered above and as usual will be made available for the purposes of evidence at trial if required and shown to be relevant to the proceedings as they unfold."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. The appellant argued that the sentence should have been increased because the trial judge failed to adequately address the inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony. The court referred to R. v. Jacquard, where the Supreme Court held that when faced with the question of whether the appellant and his counsel had been properly instructed in their respective jurisdictions, the jury was properly instructed. In this case, the appellant's testimony at trial was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case and the evidence of the Crown and the defence was also properly addressed."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.

The Crown sought s. 718.01 for a lengthy probation period to follow the custodial provision of s. 161 of the code and a mandatory prohibition order from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, ammunition and explosive substance during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole. Accordingly, the voting agreement is not caught by subsection 14.01.","All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that: If a party wishes to sell, assign, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its Participating Interest, the parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all of its participating Interest” to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the Joint venture agreement.

Thus, the phrase 'participating interest in the Program Lands or Project Area' did not constitute a sale of voting rights as contended by the appellant. 2)The phrase 'offering notice' was deleted to add weight to the proposal. 3)The use of the word 'participation interest' in the context of the original agreement was not substantively relevant to the purpose of creating a new right of first refusal, even if it was a broad definition, which would have been accepted by the majority of the parties. 4)The word 'ownership' as used in s.14.01 to describe the offer to buy the Offered Interest for cash, subject to rights of the Purchasers pursuant to Article XIV (herein called the 'Third Party Offer'), and the cash consideration and other terms on which the sale and purchase is desired to be made by the Vendor to the Third Party were all added upon."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2).

The affidavit of Shirley Scott shows with the required precision the amount of the debt owing on the judgment, the debt or the liquidation demand as the case may be.  3) It is trite law that a plaintiff has a statutory right to garniishee the defendant’s funds before the validity of the claim has been determined if the action is for a debt or a liquidative demand. 4) Pre-judgments Garnishee is an extraordinary remedy and failure to strictly comply with the provisions of the act goes to jurisdiction and renders the garnihee summons nullity. 5) The affidavit filed by the applicant is a true copy of an invoice dated October 31, 2005 and is of no assistance to the Court in making its decision.  6) The Court has not considered any of the contents of the affidavits filed by either party or statement of defence and counterclaim."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for access to his children at a settlement conference. He alleged that the mother had refused to provide access and communication with his children. The father had been denied access for multiple sclerosis and was now facing the prospect of losing his mobility. He requested that all restrictions on his access be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to driving. The mother objected to the access restrictions and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November 2007. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the father’s medical condition and his use of marijuana did not constitute a risk to the children. As long as the children were able to make informed decisions about their health and safety, they would be able to drive safely. The concerns relating to the medical marijuana use and its possible effect on his driving were minor and not serious issues."
8_1995canlii5717.txt,"The Respondent and the Applicant had a violent argument after which the Applicant and the child left the matrimonial home and moved to Transition House. The Applicant sought and obtained an emergency intervention order under The Victims of Domestic Violence Act from a Justice of the Peace giving her exclusive occupation of the matrimonial home and restraining her husband from having any contact with her or their daughter during the currency of the order. This order was then brought before a Queen's Bench Judge as required by s.5 of the Act for review. The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered. HELD: Order vacated.  1)An emergency intervention order is granted by a Justice of the Peace under s.3 of the Act without notice to the person whose conduct it restrains and without any representations from that person or on that person's behalf. It is an extraordinary remedy to be granted only where serious and urgent circumstances indicate a need for prompt action to protect the victim. 2)Absent such urgency, the application should be one for a 'victim's assistance order' brought to a Queen's Bench Judge in Chambers under s.7 in accordance with The Queen's Bench Rules. 3)In this case the domestic violence complained of occurred on January 28. There was no evidence that on February 1, 1995, Dolgopol was at risk of immediate harm. There was by then no element of urgency and the application for relief should have awaited the regular Queen's Bench Family Law Division chamber sittings.  4)The Court commented that it was unclear whether this rehearing was to proceed de novo or as a review but determined that the order should not stand in any event and therefore terminated it forthwith.","FIAT. Acting under the authority of The Victims of Domestic Violence Act, a justice of the peace made an order granting Dolgopol exclusive occupation of the family residence and restraining his wife or daughter from having contact with him during thecurrency of the order. The order was made in the context of an emergency intervention order. HELD: The application for relief was directed to be heard by a judge of the court pursuant to s5 of the Act. There was no element of urgency and the application should have been brought in the ordinary course. No one appeared on this rehearing and it was unclear whether the parties were given notice."

The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the subcontractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub contractor. The contract stipulated that if the Act applied, the contractor would be required to pay directly to suppliers and labourers for All Ports, unless some other party had a prior claim to the holdback fund. In the absence of a contract, the supplier would not have been entitled to recover anything due to the third party statutory liens. The supplier's claim was dismissed. HELD: 1)The mechanics' lien Act does not apply to this contract or this work. 2)If the Mechanics' Lien Act had applied it would have been applicable less the requirement of a holdback of 10% of the value of the work, services and materials actually done, placed or furnished. 3)The only authority cited with respect to the purpose and effect of Clause 4 (4) of the Bond is Johnson Controls Ltd. et al. (1996), 157 N.S.R. (2d) 350 (S.C.A.D.) which considered provision of a Bond identical to that considered in Davison, J. held that there was no priority in the particular circumstances and, therefore, costs ought not be awarded against it. 4)The letter from London Guarantee to Hazmasters was not a promise to pay as it contained no words of explicit promise. It was submitted on behalf of Hazmasters that the handwritten note contained no such words as explicit promise and that it desisted from immediately pusuing its rights under the Bond constituted sufficient consideration to support the claim to pay."

The defendant monitored the temperature in the freezer and cooler at the business. The plaintiffs sued because their freezer failed and meat spoiled after a circuit breaker at the business tripped off. The defendant had received no alarm. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","HELD: The action was dismissed. It was not possible on the evidence to say with any certainty why Gardon Securities did not receive such an alarm generated by the rising of the freezer temperature at Sturgis Meats as a result of a circuit breaker at the business being tripped off. The monitoring equipment was in good working order. An employee of the monitoring company was monitoring the signal from Sturgisi Meats and no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, 2010. The issue was whether there was a cause beyond Gardon's control which resulted in no such alarm being received by them so it could be reported to Sturgie Meats. The onus was on the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that the breach of the contract was within their control. HELD: 1) The plaintiff was found to have breached the contract by failing to attend six months of the specified time period to repair the equipment. 2) There was no evidence presented by the plaintiff that any request for repair was ever received from the business after the incident. The detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon ensured that there was no failure of the equipment at the company. 3) The defendant was found not to have provided any proof that the monitoring equipment had failed or was adjusted improperly by someone other than the plaintiff."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying it for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States and is looking to retire in the next few years. The petitioner is on long term disability. She is trying to obtain employment that pays her an annual income of $109,912. HELD: 1) The respondent’s application was dismissed.  2) The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay the child support owed. It would not be appropriate to reduce child support based on his actual income over the years. 3) There was no undue hardship. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time and, in some cases, had to resort to welfare to provide for the children. 4) There were no special circumstances on which the respondent could have taken employment that paid him $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 5) The petitioner was not able to work as a registered nurse. She was on long-term disability and could not put her children into extracurricular activities.

e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the sender did not take the content of the email as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial in May 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence, and placed on probation with conditions. Supplementary submissions were made by both parties. The trial judge did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence was more technical than the Crown's submission that the sender sent the email with the intent to get reaction from the student and that the words in issue were part of a computer program. 2)There was no evidence of the sender's intention to kill the student. The evidence raised issues of admissibility of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination, and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that he thought the person he was trying to contact was monitoring the student's typing. 3)The trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant's evidence raised the requisite mens rea for an acquittal, a new trial or conditional discharge on the basis that the trial judge failed to inquire into the sender’s identity or the nature of the e-mail. 4)There were no errors by the Crown with respect to the evidence provided by the respondent. The court found that the evidence was part of the “narrative” and concluded that the Crown had not met the burden of proving the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)It was not open to the court to impose sentence on the appellant for failing to provide sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on these elements."

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace. HELD: The Crown failed to provide proper disclosure to defence counsel, the non-disclosure had an adverse effect of the accused's ability to make full answer in defence and the appropriate remedy was to refuse to allow the Crown to call Ace as a witness.","The accused was charged with break and enters of homes and was denied involvement.

At the very least, another lawyer should have sat through the entire Crown case in order to be as effective as possible in the cross-examination of this witness. HELD: The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by the Crown's failure to inform the defence that the witness they intended to call would be a Crown witness. A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. The court found that requiring another lawyer to step in to cross-examine the witness would not be appropriate.

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused.

The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court.

The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody.

The Crown applied under s. 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The Defence did not oppose the application. HELD: The young person was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention and 6 months of community supervision. He was prohibited from possessing firearms, ammunition, knives, or knives outside of his residence. 1) A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The Court had little confidence that the young person would successfully comply with conditions, if probation alone were imposed, given his history of non-compliance.

9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis that the issues raised in this case were exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one in respect of the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon. Each of the issues dealt with were new and relevant to this appeal.  1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. As with all other fully enclosed shopping centres in Saskat, the assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all the other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) The assessment Appeals Committee did not err in concluding that abnormal functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type construction but rather a vintage building when design standards were different and building has seen its day. The present method of assessing the common area is reasonable and meets the definition of 'caused by changes in demand, design and technology which resulted in loss in the utility' by dismissing various suggestions that the underground parkade was functionally obsolete. The proposal to have the food court and mini-golf be common areas or commercial rental space was rejected by the Committee as not meeting the criteria set out in the report. 3) The appeal must be dismissed on the same basis as the other grounds of appeal."

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the city owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At issue was whether an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday(holiday) or whether the City is obliged to pay overtime as required by the Act for hours worked over 32 in a week which has a holiday in it.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants were charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: 1) Leave to cross-examine was granted. Leave should be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. 2) The authorization was set aside as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3) The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrants and a stay of proceedings excluded from trial. 4) The Crown did not err in arguing that evidence tendered at preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence. Given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code, there is no reason that the granting of leave to cross examine should be the preserve of the court judge. The fact that the applicant did not consider this possible is a strong directive to that end. 5) The use of an undercover police officer or police agent is not the general rule. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge. R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. Preliminary inquiry evidence: The Crown obtained an edited copy of the affidavits used to obtain the authorization in the Dosch case. The editing included deletion of all dates on which the police obtained information about a grow operation. The blanks were filled in to verify some of the information he had received from the informant. The balance of this paragraph consisting of sub-clauses (b) to (h) have been edited out. It would appear to be an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing."
9_2007skqb98.txt,"The appellants were found guilty of breaching a rural municipal bylaw which provides 'That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet [sic].' There were four grounds of appeal: 1) an application to admit new evidence on appeal; 2) a constitutional challenge seeking a declaration that the bylaw was ultra vires for uncertainty; 3) the significance of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw; and 4) the meaning of the word 'livestock' in the bylaw. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","The appellants appeal from their conviction of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted the appellants of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellation's use of the word 'hamlet' in reference to the bylaw does not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. The bylaws and bylaws of the rural municipality do not reference livestock in the sense of a hamlet since they do not refer to a particular type of livestock. In the absence of a specific definition of livestock, the word is uncertain. It can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. 2)The three bylaws tendered by appellants that were tendered to them in 2006 did not reference cattle. They were in position to peruse the bylaws relating to districts labelled hamlet and learn of the rules governing their property including the rule prohibiting cattle in that zoning district. The second bylaw purports to be an amendment to the rural Municipality's basic planning statement and its relevance to the issues was not apparent. The amendments in this document are not reflected in the version of the zoning bylaw that was put in evidence. 3)In any event, the uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the previous regime no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in district zoned Hamlet. Cement, livestock and other living creatures that might be kept by people, including bees and butterflies, are not allowed in that district. 4)Human error in lawThe trial justice made no errors in law. His findings of fact were supported by the evidence."

Due to the unavailability of this service, the mother had given evidence in Nunaveut and the child had been sent to Nova Scotia to live with her father. There was no change in the circumstances. HELD: Custody was granted to the father. He had to spend considerable time with his father to retain ties with her and his Inuit culture. The paramount consideration of what is in the best interest of the child would require the Court to consider this as one of the factors to determine custody.  1)The father was to provide the financial and environmental factors. The mother's physical environment did not compare to that of the applicant.

8_2009nssc351.txt,"The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs, who were associated in the practice of law, filed an application for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs submitted that RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. They alleged damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and breach of the contracts. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC's solicitors in 1990. The Court refused to dismiss the action on the basis that there was an understanding that the matter would proceed until such time as RBC would not acquiesce or allow the plaintiffs' application to have the action dismissed. The solicitors did not represent the plaintiffs. There was no evidence that they consented to the action. The matter did not advance for over 20 months. The delay was entirely due to the negligence of the plaintiff's solicitor and the plaintiff himself was blameless. The plaintiff never asked for those particulars. Even allowing for the two-and-a-half year delay, the delay was of some eight years."

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24 count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto.

The issues are whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided. The second issue is to be dealt with by 'Laporte inventory'.

There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been written in a reasonably accessible manner and does not detract from the ability of the defence to make an argument on the issue of trial fairness.  2) The disclosure provided is reasonably accessible. It is appropriate to have the disclosure be provided in a usable format. In this case, the issue is whether the Crown and the defence have an obligation for disclosure in general terms in a slightly different fashion. The question is not whether the disclosure meshed with the particular lawyer's skills as opposed to general skills that all lawyers should have. In some cases, it would be by way of electronic disclosure or, in some situations, combination of the two. However, the choice is theirs, so long as the disclosure is reasonable accessible. The court is able to embark upon a Laporte inquiry and make the appropriate order, if any, regarding further disclosure, or should that issue be left to the trial judge. 3) The format of disclosure provided by the Crown in this case is appropriate. There are some 30,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence in addition to 275 audio files, 50 video files and large series of photos. The Crown does not object to the existence of hard copies. The issue that has arisen in other cases (R. v. Jonsson), [2001] W.W.R. 325, Klebuc J. (as he then was) stated: 'Whether production on computer diskettes or CD-ROM's is adequate will vary with the sophistication of the accused and his or her counsel's ability to access data stored thereon.'

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence had a serious personal injury offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. There were also 10 convictions on it for violent offences, six of which related to peace officers. In addition, the accused had violated his mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and been recommitted to the Penitentiary and breached a conditional sentence order once. The crimes of violence for which the accused has been convicted include the assault of a police officer which occurred when he was cornered by two officers and a large tree branch which was about seven feet long and three-quarters to two inches in diameter. The police officer fired his taser at the accused, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. At paragraph 41 of the judgment, the Crown referred to R. v. Ponticorvo, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII), in which the Court held that a penitentiary sentence is warranted given the accused's record, his violent conduct, his record, the offences of violence against the peace officer and his repeated breaches of mandatory supervision and breaches of his parole. In this case, it was the accused who displayed such indifference that the Court concluded that the accused was 'within the realm of possibility or beyond it'."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at trial was that of the police officer who had stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. After he determined the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The subsequent breathalyzer certificate was excluded from the evidence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. The evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the learned judge has concluded that the case is almost directly on all fours with Prosper. The Crown has not proven that the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed his mind about seeking legal advice. 2) On the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction to hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee until a reasonable opportunity to reach counsel has been provided to him/her, the Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown has met the burden of establishing that the Respondents right to a free, preliminary legal advice is not abusively waived. 3) The holding-off requirement on police in this case flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded that a warning was required to the respondent after he asserted the right to counsel and the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 4) The Certificate of Analysis was excluded."
d_2011skpc108.txt,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,"The accused was charged with common assault and common assault. The issue is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was not guilty of the offence of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Court does not know who to believe, and he is not convicted of this offence contrary to ss.267 of the Code. In assessing credibility, the Court is guided by the principles restated in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.) (1996), 141 Sask. R. 221 (Sask. C.A.) and the Defence Principles. The accused bears no onus whatsoever in the determination of credibility. The Crown must prove that its evidence is credible. Even if the Court prefers to have the Crown's evidence, it must still consider if the evidence for the defence raises a reasonable question. The credibility of material witnesses needs to be considered, in that context."
d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife, who needed the vehicle as transportation for herself and her children, sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner and always in possession of the car. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. Certificates of ownership are important as property. However, ownership does not depend upon registration. There are many unregistered vehicles. Once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour the holder of a registration certificate and as matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. The Credit Union's claim was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of the wife."
b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The Court granted the petitioner exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. Although no reasons were given on the granting of the interim exclusive possession order, the petitioner raised concerns that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, which the Court could not reasonably attribute to the respondent. The Court found with respect to the totality of the evidence that: 1) the respondent was significantly involved in his children's lives, well beyond the level of many or most fathers who have normal work commitments; 2) the petitioner was entirely entitled to rebut the presumption that increased contact between the parties would in fact be beneficial. The evidence supported the conclusion the respondent would not be able to support such an application given the circumstances; and 3) that there was an artificial set of circumstances that would militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship. The petitioner's grounds for so applying stated that he was scratching not masturbating and that he had been unable to avoid contact with the children for the past two years. The father had previously been diagnosed as being addicted to pornography, but now denied having ever masturbated in the presence of his children; and 4) that his anger management issues had made it difficult for him to put the children to bed with the exception of brief periods of uninterrupted daytime access. The court concluded that the evidence did not support the respondent's conclusion that he would be unable to protect the children from the risk associated with unsupervised access. Therefore, the Court refused to impose a minimum supervision access order on the father."

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that they would pay $3,000 per month plus support for their son Michael and their daughter Karin. Since then the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,500 per month and even those have been irregular and not on time. The husband is currently suspended with pay. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was the uncertainty of the husband's future job and income, the uncertainty as to what he will require if he does decide to enter the workforce this fall. Also, there were uncertain prospects for the wife's future employment. 2)The respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $ 1,000 without at least consulting with the wife. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received in April and in April. 3)The petitioner had been paid $3000.00 per month since December 1994. She claimed she had received only a total of $ 3,000. None of the allegations were refuted. The respondent was entitled to vary the maintenance he was paid in relation to the number of months he was paying. 4)The Court allowed the petitioner to have her costs of the matrimonial home sold and the net proceeds from the sale of the home to be distributed to the spouses. 5)The court allowed the respondent to unilaterally trim the respondent's maintenance he had paid up until December 1995 by an amount not in the amount sought. 6)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of spouse maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There are too numerous unknown factors including the future status of the spouse whose future employment is uncertain. There is no evidence that she will require a return to her previous income. The Court was of the opinion that this was an interim application."

The respondent failed to show that, on balance, an action is the preferable route. While not all of the witnesses will be ascertained quickly, the important ones can be, which is all that Rule 6.03(5)(a) requires. The hearing should be predictable in scope and length and ready to be heard within months. The issues are straightforward. The only thing that would cause delay is the intended counterclaim.","The applicants apply in this Court for a motion to convert the debentures held by the Respondent, Medusa Medical Technologies Incorporated, into an action. The application alleges that the respondent's conduct has caused it to suffer damages and that it wants to counterclaim against the respondent and Bough. The Respondent has commenced a separate action for damages against the applicants. At issue is whether the application can be converted to an action and if so, whether the presumptions in favour of the application must carry the day. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) Rule 6.03(4) provides a number of factors which can go a long way to making future events more predictable and more certain. 2) The applicant can be expected to be ready to be heard in months rather than years. The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the applicant's enforcement application. Medusa has failed to meet its burden of proving such a proposition on a balance of probabilities. 3) The Court reviewed all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to by the parties and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties. 4) Each party shall have their costs on this motion on a party and party basis."

The learned judge misconstrued the situation. Accepting the recommendation of both the Crown and the defence, that there be a conditional discharge, 3 years probation, absolutely no contact direct or indirect with the named victim and no contact with the accused during the specific that allows for further discharge, the sentence is reasonable and the accused will not violate the order that was made."

Two health care institutions, one a residential and one a hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. HELD: It is within the purview of the Board to interpret s.37 and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. To jump immediately to an analysis of the facts premised on a different interpretation does not serve. The interpretation of the board of s.37 was not patently unreasonable. It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. The applications to the Board were made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, many issues including the use of a transcript and the question of current status and degree of review were raised. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the order for vote held as premature. 1)There was no evidence that any of the steps had occurred at the time of the hearing. 2)The standard of review suggested that the labour Relations Board and the Chamber judge both focused on facts they found to be significant. More fundamentally, however, each had in mind an interpretation of s.37. An analysis of the facts is impossible without deciding what the superstructure, that is, the meaning of s37, is. 3)The Board was not prepared to limit itself to indicia of transfer of title or assets of nature which might be more pertinent in the context of, for example, financing arrangements, insurance contracts or other such matters. 4)The fundamental question was whether the Board's interpretation was patently unreasonable. 5)The evidence suggesting otherwise was not accepted. 6)The Court was of the view that the fundamental question which should have been addressed by the chamber judge was whether he could have been asked more simply was that the issues raised by the transcript did not exist. The transcript was not used and the definition of 'patently unreasonable' was not raised except in the opinion of the Court of Appeal. 7)It was not appropriate to jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on different interpretation."

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT. The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim was with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as a person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than 2 months have gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of the plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. The Court is going to make an interim order subject to further argument by counsel that they wish to do so that the struck or dissolved corporation should be allowed to file her affidavit in support of its case. Alternatively, if the plaintiff corporation still wants to file its affidavit, it should make herself available for the purpose of cross-examination. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit. HELD: The Court held that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness, the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed, as if it was a registered entity in Saskatchewan and it would be entitled to defend an action initiated against it before its dissolution. In this case, the dissolved corporate defendant corporation represented its former president and sole director and shareholder, Orion Morgan. Accordingly, the plaintiffs wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed on its behalf. The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. It was owned by the defendants and their realtor, who was hired by the plaintiff to advise her that there had been a problem with the skylight in the house and that she could not realistically afford to buy the home. The defendant, who had recently purchased a new home, also misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, namely that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site, in so doing, it is alleged that they breached the terms of the contract between them. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in her home.  1) The evidence from the realtor was that the house had been heated by wood, which caused cracks in the eaves, peepholes in the attic and a gas line onto the property. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences.  2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The realtor looked at nothing in particular since the rural municipality had not done any such inspections prior to 2000. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park did not inspect the property and did not provide a copy of the building permit. 3) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition in the contract for sale. The offer was made at the expense of the plaintiff. The husband was not the only one buying the property at the time. The wife was the primary caretaker of the home during the construction of the house. She was involved in the preparation of the PCDS and in the execution of the inspection. 4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000,000 for each year that she paid for the home, and that the husband was to pay $250,000 to have the home delivered. The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement for a further 50 years. The parties were also entitled to solicitor-client costs. 5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext."

In this action, the plaintiff sought to have a solicitor removed from his practice as a result of allegations of misconduct by the solicitor in the employ of the defendant, the Attorney General of Nova Scotia. The intervenor brought an application to strike the defendant's proceeding on the basis that the application was based upon an affidavit filed by the applicant's solicitor. In making his application, the intervenor argued that, because he sought a determination of the allegations ofmisconduct of another solicitor, he was permitted to be both witness and counsel. The defendant objected, putting himself in the position of a witness who may be cross-examined.

An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC.

The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v.

No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff. He was the only party entitled to the monies.","The plaintiff practising lawyer commenced an action against the defendant in March 1999 for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""). In April 1999, SPMC filed notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of their claim with respect to potential wage claims owing by the defendant company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of the Labour Standards Act. Tapp then made an ex parte application on Q.B.G. 969 of 1999 for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPMC. On April 13, 1999, the Director of Labour Standards directed that the application for payment be made by notice of motion and that all parties interested in the funds should be served. HELD: 1)The application was dismissed with costs of the application to be taxed.  2)Although the plaintiff was not entitled to a judgment against any party for which he had not obtained a judgment in respect of the first party claim, his claim had been proven by reason of the certificate of the Minister of Labour which had not been issued by the date of this application. 3)The Certificate of Labour was not issued to the applicant. 4)The applicant was entitled to interest less the amount previously ordered paid out as costs. 5)The certificate of a Labour Standards Branch employee who had entered into agreement to create a fund for the purpose was dismissed by the Director.  6)There was no evidence that any of the parties who may have a claim against the Minister had entered a judgment or entered judgment against him. The evidence was that no certificate had been issued to him by the time he entered the judgment.  7)It was therefore not appropriate for the Minister to create the fund for his own benefit.  8)The Minister's claim was dismissed according to the terms of the judgment filed by QB.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company. The defendant, STC, admitted to dismissing the plaintiff without cause or notice in breach of its contract of service with him. In consequence the plaintiff obtained a judgment for damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles (the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law. Was this error? Even if it were, and it was, it was not in substance at least, too much can be made of it. The severance terms of the plaintiff's contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service with the company and were accordingly attributed to him for the purpose of mitigating his loss."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by a judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown argued that the warrant was quashed in error and that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the decision. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the standard of review set out in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search warrant and in determining that the evidence contained in the information to be unproven and not sufficient to conclude that the issuing justice could have issued the warrant. Further, the evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and, in the result, the result would not necessarily have been the same."

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle at the time of the accident when she was struck from behind. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the defendant's vehicle, it would still be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff also argued that she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; if the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of the plaintiff’s car.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied for relief from forfeiture on the basis that her interest in the Lincoln was not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was not the same as that of the automobile. 2)The automobile was not intended to be used as a 'offence-related property' but rather as a conveyance that was used to facilitate the commission of a designated substance offence. 3)The Lincoln was owned and operated by the same person for 14 years. 4)Section 20(4) prescribes the powers of the court upon the hearing of an application for forfeiture. The court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of sentences would have been appropriate to punish and punish. 5)The test for determining whether a sentence is disproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter. 6)Section 19(3) provides the authority for the court to make an order of relief from forfeiting. There is no charge against the applicant at this time. The third category encompasses someone who may own, have an interest in forfeitable conveyance, but there was no possible means by which that person could have determined that the conveyance might have been utilized to commit the offence."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000.  1) The evidence was not persuaded that the judge erred in concluding the child was a dependent child pursuant to s. 2(c) of the Act and in ordering maintenance. 2) There was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and therefore depart from it. He did not err.  3) The order for support was not premised on the child's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. He was taking a hiatus from work to pursue his studies. It was not his intention to work permanently. The child had not withdrawn from the charge of his parents."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.

They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. The father takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’�s Law Act, 1997. It is only if grant the grandmother the appropriate status that she can apply for custody. The grandparents’ relationship with the children was not fostered by the father. 2) The father was granted supervised access to the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. He was to have supervised access for the children. 3) The parties’ children were to reside primarily with the grandmother. There was no evidence that the father was unable or unwilling to pay child support for the two boys. 4) The grandmother was to provide the father with parenting time. 5) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest” question, in the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child, was the nature and relationship of the child. The nature and intensity of the relationships between the parties and their best interests did not enter the analysis at that point. The evidence from the grandmother was insufficient to determine whether the father could show a settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the baby. The court could have served an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Act. The plaintiff argued that SGI had prior knowledge that he was a victim of a motor vehicle accident and that his benefits were terminated because he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI's termination of benefits was appropriate and the plaintiff was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received.  1)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the plaintiff prior to and after the accident resulted in his suffering of soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine and resulting conduct on October 1 and thereafter.  2)The plaintiff's benefits under the Personal Injury Protection Plan were terminated as a result of the accident. 3)Sawkiw's benefits were to be re- terminated. SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. 4)If the plaintiff is found to have a relapse under s.142(1)(a), the court found that under the terms of this judgment, SGI expected the plaintiff to participate in daily physiotherapy in Yorkton if he was receiving a full, rather than partial income replacement benefit. 5)Swingkiw was to be entitled to interest on such an amount as should have been paid."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years.  1) The defendant did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity. He had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in Latin course. He used the university computers to engage in the activities. 2) There were no barriers put in place to restrict distribution of the product. The fact that the defendant had not accessed the internet since he was arrested was not a mitigating factor. Denunciation and deterring others who might be inclined to engage the activity of distributing child porn requires a long term incarceration. A conditional sentence would not bestrong enough in the circumstances to deter others, who might come to the accused's attention if he were incarcerated. 3) There was no evidence to support the conditional sentence as the defendant was not an appropriate candidate for programming."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant held a hearing in Small Claims Court on behalf of the claimants. During that hearing, the judge refused to issue summons to the defendant and issued a Supplementary Interim Ruling, which ordered that the defendant should be given an opportunity to argue the issues identified. The applicant then submitted 18 Claims for issuing by the defendant. The defendant was solicitor for all of the proposed plaintiffs and after some careful reflection and consultation with administrative personnel within the court, issued the Interim Rule. The Court reviewed the letter when it was absent from the court and was satisfied the judge had not voiced his opinion about the speed at which the matter was being considered. The court found that the summonses were not being issued because the defendant had not provided notice to the other potential parties. Therefore, the court declined to issue the summons. The application for declaratory relief was dismissed."
2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The husband was 52 years old and unemployed. He qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. The petitioner alone provided for the three children. In the circumstances, it should not take the form of spousal support. HELD: Relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should take form of maintenance.  1)The claim for relief was grounded in the fact that the respondent was the registered owner of the farm land and received the entire rental. The difference in value relates to a section of land which was one quarter of which contained the matrimonial home. 2)The petitioner attributes $2,292.58 to the children. If one refers to that sum in The Federal Child Support Guidelines the related income exceeds $150,000. The actual amount is $210 which is 33% of the respondent's income of $630. 3)There is no requirement that the husband live in a group home and there is no basis upon which can order or even expect such. The children are adequately provided for. As to luxurious living, the petitioner had the means to pay $500. 4)The court found that there was a sufficient total of means to enable the petitioner and the children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and the respondent to enjoy an improved standard. The latter can be achieved by providing the respondent some of the income earned from his land."

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.",HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the respondent had not proven that he was a person of sufficient interest. The court found that the petitioner had not demonstrated that she was in the best interests of her children. Access to the respondent was not in the petitioner's best interests.
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The Crown also established that the wounds were not serious enough to be consideredaggravated."

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The officer testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District when the 'ride along' had no duties and was simply with the accused. The accused testified that at 2:00 a.m. he noted the accused's vehicle and decided to stop it to check out the driver's licence and registration. He said the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again and that it was his last chance to breath. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)There was a discrepancy between the testimony of the accused and that of the officer. 2)The officer gave forthright manner and accepted it without reservation. The police officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details. 3)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s 254(5)of the Code consists of intentional non-compliance.

The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.

A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","An insolvent person applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T.

The applicant opposed the approval of the applicant's proposal on the basis that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should beclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in bankruptcy for court approval. At the December meeting of creditors, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed the proposal. HELD: The proposal was granted.

The proposed amended para. 9.1 was consistent with s. 50 of the BIA and it was ordered accordingly.  1)The court was much in sympathy with the concerns raised by the objection and those of the other pensioners who had proven claims. The trustee was appointed by the Company to act as trustee and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 8.1 of the Proposal. 2)The trustee's position in bankruptcy was better placed than that of an employer in identifying pension plan creditors by virtue of their status as creditors.

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity.

The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., did operate a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.

Wood Products, through its contractor, Logging (referred to as P E) harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the Chishum Logs. The defence argued that once the logs reach the company, they have already been processed and to require the company to have a processing licence is unnecessary. The court found that P & E Logs did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The Court found that the defendant and the plaintiff were found guilty of violating s. 17.2(1)(a) of the Act. The Court held that the defendants were involved in the manufacture of the forest product for the log home industry and that the creation of the chisum log was a processing and must require a processing license. The accused were found to have entered into an agreement to supply the defendant with the necessary materials and equipment to process the logs. The agreement stipulated that the accused would be required to register their processing facility with the Ministry of Environment pursuant to a Forest Products Management Act (FPMA). The Court noted that the definition of'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says 'any step taken'.

Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven.

The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.

The following year, the inspector general appointed under the Justice Minister appointed by the appellant to investigate the allegations of institutional abuse in the institutions for youth correction and protection. The inspector general recommended that the Justice Department provide the respondent with a summary of all of the allegations made against him, as well as recommendations on how to achieve that objective.

During this time, approximately 40,000 statements were made, mostly by the respondent, although some were made by others. In some cases, the statements were actually signed by people who had been involved in the investigation. In others, statements were given only to the respondent. The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of Community Services became meshed and interchangeable is clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins. The appeal is taken from a decision of Robert Doherty, Freedom of information and Protection under the Act, which appointed a review officer pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Act. In this case, the appellant was granted access to the information requested.

As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800.

The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for the two children of the marriage. The respondent wife opposed the application. HELD: An order for a trial was ordered. 1)The petitioner husband was ordered to pay the respondent for her support and for the support of the two infant children. He denied there were any arrears. 2)The respondent wife did not have any desire or desire to participate in activities with the children. 3)An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month. A further agreement was made increasing the monthly maintenance to $554.13 and further increasing the maintenance in January to $570 (dismissal). 4)Any monies payable by the petitioner husband to the respondent wife on account of child support will be increased on the anniversary date of the order and every year thereafter in accordance With Section 34(6) of The Family Law 5. 5)The applicant became unemployed in 1993 having accepted a severance package with General Motors.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. HELD: The court was struck. The respondent was not bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The court had an opportunity to hear both parties in this action on evidence in chief and under cross examination. It was not an appropriate case under the simplified procedure. The portions of the affidavit were not evidence but hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. Although the respondent may have sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the canons of the Law Society."

Finding the defendant solely at fault, that evidence from the accident reconstruction as to the angle of impact supported a conclusion the defendant was travelling faster than she realized and was inattentive. Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss in his left ear, neck injury and knee injury. He was taken to hospital by ambulance to hospital. The flare-ups of pain since the motor vehicle accident had been more severe than those prior to the accident. The onus is on the plaintiff to establish negligence. The plaintiff's inattention, coupled with a higher rate of speed than she estimates, renders her solely responsible for this accident, and she was not justified in entering the lane of opposing traffic."
e_2017skqb265.txt,"The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code. During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of dangerous driving, one of which related to his failure to recognize stopped vehicles in an active construction zone. The accused had been charged with operating a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and caused the death of three young boys. The Court was of the view that the accused's inattention for whatever reason had caused the accident resulted in his being struck by a semi-trailer. The impact on the three boys was so severe that one of the boys, who was standing near the driver's side of the vehicle, suffered a broken collarbone, a broken left collarbone and a fractured left clavicle. The injuries sustained by the driver were those of the two boys who had been killed in the collision. The defendant was sentenced to six years imprisonment in federal institution, with a 10 year driving prohibition and a $1,000 victim surcharge for $800 payable forthwith and in default eight days consecutive to the six-year sentence. The aggravating and mitigating factors in the case were not considered by the Court because the defendant had no previous driving record. The Criminal Code requires that all sentences must be just and fair and consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible. In dangerous driving cases, however, denunciation and deterrence play a significant role in maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice. These past two years have been particularly difficult on the families of the victims as they have been through so much pain and suffering."
b_1999canlii12533.txt,"The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The parties resided at 2335 Ottawa Street, Regina, until their separation August 31, 1997. Upon separation the petitioner obtained accommodation elsewhere. The respondent continued to live in the matrimonial home. During the first 2 months of the separation the children spent alternate weeks with each parent. The petitioner was the primary caregiver and the respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. Both parents were responsible for the lack of communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. HELD: 1)Both parents were to have interim joint custody of the children. 2)The petitioner was to have reasonable telephone access with the children and access at such other times as the parties may agree. The father was to pay child support of $31,800 per month. 3)The parties were to work on improving their communication and parenting in the best interests of their children. They were both very good parents. It was unfortunate that they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively. The children were close to their paternal grandparents. Their conduct indicates a lack of sensitivity at times, on the part of both parents, to the needs of each other."
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the sheriff to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. The sheriff has the power to seize and sell the shares in the name of Jensen. He has not pledged, hypothecated, sold or encumbered the said share certificate which would require them to be delivered to any third party in accordance with any obligations or encumbrances he may have placed against the same company. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the shares within the company is the plaintiff's claim as creditor. It is on this principle that the solicitor has a lien as a creditor. In this case, the argument that the receiver cannot have rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor cannot be sustained. The claim for lien is not made out. HELD: The court held that the end result of the seizure and sale of Jensen's shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained. The court declined to refuse the shares to the receiver. 1) The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if they were still in possession of them. He knows of no legal obligation between himself and the plaintiff whereby he is required to deliver up to the plaintiff his Class 'A' Common, voting shares. 2) The portion of the affidavit that was used to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff was uncontroverted. There was nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the client is not not the owner of the shares. The defendant has no greater right to refuse production and delivery of documents than is his client's when faced with the right of third party to require production of the documents. 3) The court did not consider a valid solicitor’s lien to have been made out on the part of the applicant."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program. At issue was whether the bank was induced to take certain steps in reliance upon the advice of its solicitor on legal matters. The plaintiff counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence. The defendants appeared before Associate Chief Justice MacDonald at an appearance day and the judge ordered them to make further disclosure by August 21, 2000. The documents sought were found to have at best tenuous relevance. Lee objected to the use of solicitor-client privilege. He argued that the plaintiff had put his state of mind in issue by pleading that the bank relied on information given by the solicitor to him. The defendant counterclaimed that the documents sought, and indeed all of the plaintiff's evidence, ought to be excluded.HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff. 1)Lee knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to the discovery and was to be disclosed. 2)The plaintiff was aware of the solicitor's position for period now approaching three years. His counsel had not advanced any information which would lead the Court to believe that there had been any exceptional circumstance which would justify granting the necessary leave to obtain the documents.  3)The documents sought appeared to have been produced voluntarily. The documentary evidence may possibly clarify those terms. In the event that the defendant's advice was outside the terms of his retainer then the advice may not have been within the meaning of the rules. 4)The applicant's counterclaim was found to be a violation of the equitable principles of fairness and consistency. 5)Although the plaintiff was a 'neighbour' to the defendant, the defendant knew of his obligation to rely upon the plaintiff and that his obligations were to be paid in full. 6)Credit was due to the bank for all the necessary preparation and preparation for the construction and financing of the project. The loan was secured against a mortgage by the defendant and the plaintiff retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The discovery proceeded without objection. 7)There was no evidence to support the claim that the loan was negligent."

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173.

The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

7_2005skqb272.txt,"FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land. The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation. In 1994, the School Division's predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division) sold land to purchasers (the Flads). The transfer was registered, however the reservation of the farm site could not be registered because it purported to effect an unauthorized subdivision of the land. The Flads filed a caveat to protect their interest. The trial judge ordered rectification of the agreements and directed the defendants to apply for subdivision approval. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The orders made in the foregoing cases can only be determined on a full examination of the evidence and not in summary fashion. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in a mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. As the school division and the Episcopal Corporation were in occupation of the proposed parcel, they failed to obtain development permits before making improvements to the site. The subsequent difficulties were of their own making and not solely ascribable to the mistakes of title. However, it is not within the Court's power to order the Registrar to effect subdivision contrary to the provisions of The Improvements Under the Mistake of Title Act. The application in question was whether the Flads retained a legal interest in the land which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act."

The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes.

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for emotional injury as a result of the loss of a motor vehicle accident.

The Plaintiff did not participate in the trial and has no interest of the outcome, the Facility Association and Wawanesa having together settled her claim. The Court found that such a claim was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff is simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect an 'insured person' under the contract.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 Charter rights by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The police had entered the appellant's home after hearing a scream from inside the home. The appellant argued that the call to the police was not a 911 call or distress call but rather a search of the premises.

b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements. 2) The hearing notice was not properly considered by the hearing officer. 3) The tenant took the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written response to the landlord's claim as she knew it would be difficult for her to attend. She did not ignore the process.  4) The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and failure to provide the tenant with the particulars of the landlord’s claim constitute reversible errors."
d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, a medical doctor who had been awarded his LL.M from Yale. The third was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of a doctor and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The residue of the estate was to be divided, with the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries. The testators' Family Maintenance Act and Matrimonial Property Act apply in Nova Scotia."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant takes the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend and to pay defence costs for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend it has been conventionally addressed by relying on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against the applicant. 2) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change a claim by reason of an exclusion under the policy. 3) The second premise is to determine whether the statements of claim is properly pleaded. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, not the insurer. 4) The third principle is articulated in Alie v. Bertrand Frère Construction Co. (2002), 222 D.L.R. (4th) 687, where Wallace J. stated that it is only in the nature of a pleadings that the insurer becomes legally obligated to protect. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt as to the claim that is resolved in favour of the insured. 5) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 6) The insurance policies in the case covered negligence but did not cover intentional torts such as sexual battery. 7) The defendants entered into a contract with the plaintiff which included the use of the Galvalume alternate. The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. The second principle is summarized in Bacon v. McBride (1984), 62 O.R.(3d) 551. The defendants were negligent and breached the contractual and other duties owed by them to the plaintiff. 8) The liability imposed by the insurance policies is a three step process followed by courts."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. Although the court had ordered that the petitioner was entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, it wanted to specify a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The petitioner was granted exclusive possession. The Court was prepared to provide directions. 1)Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal did not stay the execution of the judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or spousal support for a child or a adult adult. 2)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules: 15(1) which provide that the service and filing of notice of appeal is not stay if the judgment is stayed pending a disposition of the appeal; and (4) Rule 15, which bars the giving of requested directions. No caselaw in support of the position of either could be found. The issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v. Young, 1986 CanLII 3216 (SK CA), R.F.L. (3d) 314, but not decided. Also find it unnecessary to decide the issue."

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act requiring him to comply with an order of the Development Officer of the Rural Municipality of Edenwold to comply within 60 days with a request to restore a parcel of land to the condition it was in immediately prior to undertaking the development. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and, despite numerous court appearances and preparation and payment of solicitor and client costs, remained in contempt of court. The court was satisfied that the respondent had not substantially complied with the orders nor had he provided any reasonable excuse for his failure to comply, for his repeated failures to complete the purging of his contempt, and for his inability to provide appropriate legal fees and disbursements to the applicant. The contempt application was therefore adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after the issuance of the order. Contempt proceedings are not for punishment per se, but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders. HELD: The court ordered the respondent to pay $15,000.00 in contempt costs and ordered him to appear in court on the issue of the contempt application. The Court was also concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment than a sanction."

There are two areas of concern: seed pods, fuzz and other debris fall from the trees in significant amounts during the summer months and during the winter months; branches from the defendant’s trees grow over the property line and intrude into the plaintiff space. A tree branch from one of the defendants’ trees may be seen as a nuisance, although the plaintiff said at this time there were many other trees within the residential area so it was impossible to demonstrate that the debris was from the others."

While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(ii) and he should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown called thirteen witnesses who provided evidence about the accused's prior criminal convictions. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and of breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence. The Court held that the evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offender designation and that long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. There was no indication of violence to others.

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000. She also sought to reduce child support to $17 per month based on a projected income of $7,000. HELD: 1)One-half of the arrears were cancelled. The mother must accept responsibility in part for allowing arrears to accumulate over the 2 years. 2)The mother was to pay $250 per month based on an imputed income of $15,000. She was capable of contributing more than $17 per month. Her share of s.7 expenses was reduced to $50 per month.

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt priority over that of its security interests in two reefer trailers. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase money security interests be priority over the security interests of the respondent in them.  1)The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term possession in s.34(2)(a) and when, in thecircumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of the priority section.  2)The respondent did not become debtor in possession until the terms of the lease were met and the security agreement was executed.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(2) are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which is not directly addressed in the section. The term 'possession' in these sections is not necessarily equivalent to bare physical possession. In the circumstances of the case before me, to deny the respondent priority over Humboltt would provide the purchaser an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air. 4)The applicant was ordered to pay full value to the respondent.  5)The application is allowed. The application is denied. The case law in this province has not as yet interpreted the constructive possession terms of either section 34(1) or section 22. These terms were not contained in either s.21 or s.33 of the previous Act. 6)There is no dispute that the time within which the buyer must be a debtor begins to run from the date the debtor acquired possession of property in the present and after acquired property as amended in January 1998 to specifically include the trailers. The respondent is a debtor as defined by the Act. 7)The evidence convinces the Court that the term possession in the Act is non-existent. It is obvious that before December 22, 1997 the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until it agreed, on November 2, 1997, to accept the debt. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respectivetrailer was delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court of Canada before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff alleged that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant alleged that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter, which he later claimed was not in writing. The issue was whether the agreement was enforceable. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. 2) The first telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The germane portions of the conversation were all that the plaintiff could gather. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.  3) The second telephone conversation, which lasted less than five minutes, is all that could be said to have created a contract of purchase and purchase of farm property. The central issue in this case is the application by the defendant to the package offer. The second phone conversation, in which the plaintiff stated that he would not accept the defendant's offer respecting the subject quarters but that he offered to bring the deposit on the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000. The court accepts that the defendant gave the plaintiff's daughter and son-in-law an assurance that the items would be sold to him and that he was not obligated to accept the bid on the other quarters. 4) There are numerous explanations for how things went wrong in the understanding between the parties, other than the inaccurate and dishonest testimony of any of the parties."

Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The victim of the shooting applied for release pending appeal. The accused appealed his sentence, arguing that his incarceration was so long that, by the time his appeal was heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. Application dismissed; the onus is on the appellant under s. 679(4)(a) to be'much more stringent' than for an appeal against conviction; given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, releasing the accused would cause unnecessary hardship. The program described by the respondent could provide much closer supervision than J.E.S. has had in the past, and would not cause undue hardship."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children, one of which was born in the course of their marriage. The respondent applied to vary the date for which retroactive child support should be paid for the younger child, arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Respondent takes issue with the respondent's claim for retroactive support and s.7 expenses for the parties' older child. The issues raised by the petitioner's application to vary are retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and the contribution to the section 7 expenses of the children. HELD: 1)The respondent's application was allowed. The court did have jurisdiction on the issue of the first issue; the court's jurisdiction to deal with the claim for retrospective child support and retroactive adjustment to the contribution Mr. Munro must make to the sections of the child support payable in timely manner. 2)The issues raised were whether the court had jurisdiction to make a retroactive order for an adult child, whether the Court should be prevented from enforcing an unfulfilled child support obligation, and 3)whether the trial judge should be limited in his or her discretion to consider blameworthy conduct. The parties' children clearly left the charge of their parents in April 2008. He established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his parents. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. The proper approach was to consider the alternative issue of recalculation of all child support payments and s7 expenses.  4)The court held that it would be appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses to be paid by each of the parties."

The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died in August 1999 at the age of 86.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' conduct was reviewed by the court. The mother alleged that she had no difficulty in future to pay the costs of his children's post-secondary pursuits and alleged that the father had no part in the agreement. Changes in the mother's income include $10,000 in monthly child and spousal support payments, $25,000 for the youngest child, who graduated from high school in June 2005, $43,600 in 2006 and $1,845 in 2007. She expects the father to continue to support her unabated and without termination, while paying all expenses related to her children's education. She has no serious contest with the father with her financial documentation. The two older children leaving their mother's care and either moving in with their father or being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven. The history of the children leaves their mother, who is now deceased, and moves in with her father, has been considered and these records have not been challenged by the Respondent. There has been no variation of the order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment dated the 24th day of April, 1996."

His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student who is a resident to return to the program, he must first obtain external funding. The College insists that this funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: 1) The student was paid for period in excess of two years while he was suspended from the program. He was placed on probation for a further six months. His third party funding was frozen during the time he was on probation. It is not clear whether the funding agency had any say in the College's decision to suspend the student. 2) There is no dispute that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy in the future. The fact that the student chose to have resort to the courts on two occasions suggests that the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 3) The fact the student's third-party funding had been prepaid allowed for the suspension with pay which occurred. Funding on an annual basis would have obviated the problem which has arisen in this matter. 4) The applicant has not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, which suggested the decision to place the student on probation had not yet been implemented. 5) There are a number of cases that raise the issue of whether visitatorial jurisdiction should include the right to review the exercise of those internal powers and discretions that derive from the internal law of the university. Jurisdiction to determine the appropriateness of a decision to impose a sentence on a resident who is not currently serving a probationary period does not lie with the Framers of Interpretation Act. The Framers were right in suggesting that a sentence could be imposed on a person who had not already served a term of probation. The Court of Queen's Bench agreed that such an exception would not have a practical effect. It would require the College to exercise its jurisdiction and powers as a visitor to the University in its ex officio role as visitor.  6) The College has been awarded status to appear at the hearing and did so. It will be prepared to enter into an agreement with the University of Saskatchewan."

The appellant had relied on a prothonotary's order extending the time to apply for a deficiency judgment, which the prothonotary did not have authority to give. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the chambers decision and giving judgment to the appellant. While the prothonotary did not have jurisdiction to extend the time for the application, an additional chambers order had resolved the timeliness issue in the appellant's favour.","The appellant mortgagee unsuccessfully sought a deficiency judgment against the respondent, a guarantor of the covenants of a mortgage given by Seawood Enterprises Ltd. to Prenor. The mortgage fell into arrears and the appellant commenced foreclosure proceedings against the respondents and one guarantor. It finally sold the property at a price of $295,000. The plaintiff then spent extensive effort to recover its outlay by marketing the property. The price obtained was significantly below the appraised value. The guarantor, who had plead non-compliance with Civil Procedure Rule 6.01 and 3.03, successfully challenged the plaintiff's claim. The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The Chambers judge held that the application could not succeed because the order of October 17, 1991 extending the time from the time within which an application for a deficiency judgement could be made was not one that the prothonotary had power to give. The order made on May 19, 1992 conclusively resolved the issue of the timeliness of the appellant's application. This was an order 'otherwise' within the meaning of Rule 41.10(3). It was consented to by the respondents' solicitor."

The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. Upon separation, the appellant moved into the basement of their matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the effects of the drug Effexor. The respondent opposed the agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not proven that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of its execution, and that there was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable effect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions, nor having established that the trial judge thought the proffered evidence could not reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial, was not an issue, and the matter was remitted to trial on the merits."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed by the Union were defamed by the publication of the grievance. The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. The hospital is also a public health institution. The plaintiff filed a grievance against the union and its representatives claiming breach of its collective agreement. The grievance alleged systemic harassment, which was not supported by the plaintiff's allegations, but was entirely unsubstantiated and without substance. The union alleged that the plaintiff took an active part in the harassment himself and sought damages for loss of income, loss of pension, and loss of opportunity to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The respondent commenced an action in defamation against the Union and the Hospital claiming general damages of over $200,000, based upon the conclusions reached by the arbitrators in Torstar Corp. and the Union in suing the union for breach of collective agreement and breach of contract. At issue was whether the arbitration board was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and whether the publication that took place destroyed any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. Counsel for the union opposed the application of the defence of qualified privilege in this case, arguing that the court should have considered two factors in assessing whether the publications were protected: 1) that the words in the grievance referenced the Union’s grievance and the Grievance Report; and 2) whether the Union filed a statement of defence which indicated the statements were based on the same grievance and not an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. The parties’ argument that the union published a grievance to try and ensure the plaintiff was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to file this grievance when the plaintiff experienced renewed personal harassment after her return from overseas; and 3) that they published an informational poster that referenced the grievance but did not refer to the grievance itself; the Union did not"

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused, who was charged with a variety of offences, was found unfit to stand trial pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the accused had 'limited cognitive capacity' which was not an accurate application of the limited cognitive capacity test, which requires that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to him, or to analyse the facts of the trial. However, there was no evidence that he was unable to participate in his trial in a meaningful way. As a result of his mental situation, for the past significant period and for the foreseeable future he appears to be incapable of paying attention to his court proceeding or participating in it in any way."

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, Ingrid, the residue of his estate. A few years later, he died in an automobile accident. The couple signed a separation agreement. They subsequently divorced. In the divorce, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement, which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will, nor did it affect the right of the former spouse to take the benefit of the deceased's estate. The executrix applied to have the judge find that, when he died, the former husband had not changed his will which left the residue to his former wife. The appellant argued that she had covenanted for valuable consideration to renounce any inheritance after the death of the testator. Dismissing the appeal, that the judge erred in law in finding that a contractual promise to renounced, given for consideration before a death of a former spouse, is not binding. The clause in question was confined to release of rights of inheritance only on intestacy. It did not address the right to confer benefit voluntarily. The judge did not decide the second issue before him which pertained to the distribution of the respondent's estate if none of the applicants were entitled to the gift of the residue."

The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.

The respondent was not the biological mother of the applicants.

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward.

The Chambers judge however gave no valid reasons for the two restrictions respecting the books or records respecting the fishing licenses and vessels but ordered them to be deleted.

The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. There was no evidence that the defendant had followed due diligence procedures in establishing a proper system to prevent their cashiers from selling tobacco to minors and whether they had taken reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. The evidence showed that prior to the incident, Westfair had an established system created to prevent the commission of the offence. The trial judge applied a standard of diligence which required the defendant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or actions could have been taken by the company's cashiers before they could purchase tobacco. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable measures to avoid the particular event. The system used by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen, s.Ct. 1997, 138 C.C.R. (3d) 68 (Ont. Prov. Ct.) set out the powers of the summary conviction appeal judge. The appeal procedure for summary conviction appeals can be found in Part XXVII of the Criminal Code (ss.813). Section 813 applies to a person accused of a strict liability offence. A person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence. They are not required or required to exercise the extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. The standard of correctness is not unreasonable. It is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. There are situations where employees are required to participate in role playing activities in order to get familiar with the store's policies and procedures. The availability of the defence to corporation will depend on whether such due diligence was taken by those who are the directing mind and will of a corporation, whose acts are therefore in law the acts of the corporation itself."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company. The appellant company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed it to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that the Assessor could not use the sale of the Northgate Mall as a 'portfolio sale' because the sale price did not amount to an 'arm's length sale'. It alleged that the Committee erred in law in failing to find that the sales of the three shopping malls in the analysis did not constitute a 'fair value' as determined by the City, as they were all sold at a rate close to market value and did not include any non-realty items. The company applied for leave to appeal under section 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act alleging an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The Committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yielded. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the sale qualified for inclusion in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived or, alternatively, it claimed that it was a 'willing, unrestricted, unrelated and knowledgeable' buyer within the meaning of the definition of 'arm's length sale' (i.e. a 'diminished' buyer) and were required to take the mall as part of the package and retain the services of the former owner as managers. 2)It was in reliance on the provisions of s. 171 and s. 172 of The Cities Act that the assessor requested the completion of the Sale Verification Form. He did so in reliance upon the three-fold purpose of putting him in position to determine the fair value of the property. He then to calculate and apply a market adjustment factor (MAAF) of 1.31. 3)The reduction in the price had significant impact on the assessments but the company remained dissatisfied and appealed to the Court of Appeal which dismissed the appeal and upheld the Committee's decision to include the sale in the determination of an appropriate MAF (maintaining a fair value for the property).

HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, one might assume the parties would jointly be seeking relief, but the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There had not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner had chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of the application and the court's own costs of filing the report. 1)The terms were improvident. There was not equality in bargaining positions. The petitioner was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000 a year while the respondent earned $48,000. The proposed judgment provided that the petitioner was not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. 2)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal judgment was anything but unconscionsable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently unfair the proposed judgement was to her. 3)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. The parties were content to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. They were not seeking legal advice or advice but were seeking advice and guidance from counsel who could be of assistance if the petitioner needed it. The court could not urge the petitioner to seek advice or guidance but would urge her counsel and would urge the court to seek the advice of counsel who would be most helpful to her in the circumstances. 4)There was no equality for guidance and guidance on how to use legal advice and counsel in the best circumstances. The agreement was clearly improvident in that it sought to have the parents respect the children's wishes regarding their choice of residence and the time that they might wish to spend with each parent. It was also possible to reduce their understanding to writing, even if there was no lawyer prepared to sign a certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons. 5)The proposed judgment was not in harmony with the petitioner's position on matters of the law and could not be taken to task for the petitioner or the Court to approve it.  6)The petitioner would be awarded costs of preparing the legal advice requested by the petitioner."

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider all relevant evidence in making a determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand. 2) The appellant challenges the objective basis for that belief, namely that there wasn't sufficient evidence that the accused has, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. 3) On the whole of the evidence, am satisfied that the court properly found there was a sufficient evidence of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. When making a demand for a breath sample, an officer is only required to believe that the suspect has committed an offence and the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. 4) The standard for assessing credibility can only be set out by an appeal court with great deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the judge should not be disturbed."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.",HELD: The court ordered a Voice of the Child report. The application was based on an alleged change of circumstances which included V. expressing a desire to live full time with R. The parents were both significantly strapped financially at this time and declined to make an order allocating the costs of the report to them. It was to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.
d_1993canlii3207.txt,"The respondent was given a three-year suspended sentence and placed on probation after pleading guilty to armed robbery. He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the robbery which took place at a convenience store. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. This was his first offence. He wanted help for his addiction problem. A suspended sentence, properly administered, was rigorous."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal brought by the trial judge dismissing charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The Saskatchewan information was sworn in March 2001 but was not available in the Alberta Court when the respondent appeared. 3)The Provincial Court judge accepted the special plea and dismissed the charges. The charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for wantof prosecution in Alberta. 4)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by a respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to be dismissed for wants of prosecution on May 6, 2001. 5)The Special Pleadings of Autrefois Acquit and Motor Vehicle Accidentals were stayed. 6)An application for a stay of proceedings was made by the Court of Appeal in Edmonton. 7)Each province has its own set of rules and regulations respecting the use of force in their respective jurisdictions. 8)A review of s.487(3) of the Code does not give rise to a successful plea of autorefois acquitted. 9)When jurisdiction was lost in Alberta the charges in Saskatchewan did not have before it an information. The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction when nothing happened in March 2000 and the subsequent appearance in May 2001. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan. 10)The accused was awarded his costs in the addition of costs of the proceeding in addition to his legal expenses. 11)The court was awarded the costs of defending the respondent in Alberta and ordered to defend three months of administrative expenses. 12)An appeal of the decision of the Provincial Court Judge was granted."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 220(3) of the Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The plan proposed to distribute shares among its 275 shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal was opposed on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets according to its respective rights and that if a creditor or shareholder cannot be found, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The applicant argued the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under ss.186.1(4), 203(8) and 210(m) and the power given to the court under s. 210(1(1)(e) to permit the court to approve a proposed distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or the division of property or assets. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate for the purpose of the proposed distribution.  1) The proposal complied with all statutory requirements for an arrangement to be approved by the court and satisfies the criteria enunciated in the Act. The court could not find any conflict between the mandatory requirements in ss. 220 and 221 and the authority to override the mandatory directions in s.220 and 221. The Court could exercise its power under the s.210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in s210(m). 2) There was no conflict with the right to share in the distribution of the capital that would have otherwise been payable to the shareholders. 3) The proposed distribution was not fit for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. 4) The court was able to find no evidence that the proposal had a wider purpose and intent than that of assisting the applicant in its submissions. 5) The Court had no difficulty in finding the Supreme Courts analysis in BCE to be equally applicable to the FCC application."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. There are valid reasons for the town employee's suspicions. He was a Professional Agrologist with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science and was qualified as an expert in the area of plant chemicals including how they are to be used and their effects on lawns and gardens. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame."

HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","Three issues arising from the breakdown of a 4 1/2 year marriage: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt.

The wife's obligation should end on November 30, 1995. 1)The court was unwilling to impose costs on the wife. 2)The respondent was entitled to an exemption for an amount of $900 per month pursuant to s. 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 3)It was necessary to promote the economic self sufficiency of each spouse within reasonable period of time."
a_1995canlii4315.txt,"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice Charles E. Haliburton dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought leave to appeal and if that is permitted, appeals that latter decision. At issue was whether the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form contrary to s. 841(3) of the Criminal Code and in failing to enunciate his findings of fact in reaching the conclusion that the accused 'knew or ought to have known of the effects of the drug that he was taking'.

Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was put to the Court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the Court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate. The respondents had their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs. Appeal dismissed."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court as a transfer had been made from Youth Court to Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court which the accused was to transfer from. The Facts Neither the complainant nor the accused were particularly credible as witnesses, each having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each had spent considerable time in jail. The complainant did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to do so. She was now 19 years old and had a child shortly after she turned 14 years of age from a more recent abusive relationship. She is now trying to come to terms with what was done to her during her childhood. HELD: 1)The Court had exclusive jurisdiction over offences committed by persons while under the age of 18 years. The Court of Queen's Bench accordingly had jurisdiction only when such a matter is transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Act. 2)The case before the Court was not transferred from the youth court as a result of a concurrent proceeding."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor trailer and another person owned a trailer. The trailer was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. The police observed the accused operating it in an easterly direction approaching a junction of highways #32 and 332. The officer stopped the vehicle and found it was being operated by the accused. No other notice was given to the public or to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. The Department of Highways had erected signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily or in any other media. The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division about the weight restriction and to advise others in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were in place along the highway leading to and from various grid roads throughout the province. HELD: Notice of an order made by the Minister of the provincial Crown affecting a public highway should have been given so as to advise as many members of the public as possible. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality satisfy the notice provisions for the purposes of this prosecution, the Crown cannot establish that an order has been made for the purpose of this case.  1)It is mandatory for the minister to give notice of a minister's order issued pursuant to section 35 of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act. There is no evidence before the court to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was granted. It is not for the Minister to advise the accused that the matter is with the municipality. 2)Signs were located along the main grid roads leading into and around the municipalities. There were numerous other signs which clearly indicated that the Minister intended to restrict the weight on the highway such that heavier vehicles would be re-directed onto municipal grid roads.  3)No other notice to the general public was given."

H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the child.

The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory authority and to its inherent parens patriae jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child; she requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected.

There was no order as to costs.  1)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults.

The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The 12 year old girl and two juvenile offenders who had been roller skating at the Wheel-A-While Family Roller Rink in Prince Albert had been charged with sexual assault.

Nothing was published that was false,malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. The attendance at the plaintiff's station was down for several days after the newscast came on the air. The employees at the defendant's store suspected that the owner of the business had been sexually assaulted at the premises. HELD: The plaintiff had a cause of action against the defendant and the action was dismissed with costs.  1)The plaintiff published the news that it received from the police, always a reliable source. Nothing points to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff in its roller rink operation. The business was on down side at the time. The sexual assault occurring where it did not occur was not the fault of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that the news which were aired would cause harm to their business or to their health.  2)The CRTC did what it was ordered to do and was exonerated by its controlling body, the CCR, for doing so. The court found that the defendant published the information that it receives from the Police and from the general public. 3)The plaintiffs suffered a loss of $12,500.00 in the first three months of 1991. The loss was attributed to the defendants' failure to pursue the sexual assault complaint and to the fact that the defendants had refused to pursue their contractual obligations with respect to the plaintiff. 4)The court awarded the plaintiff $7,500 in the amount of the settlement amount and the rest was left to the plaintiffs, who appealed the decision of the Court to strike.  5)The Court awarded the rest of the costs of the action with costs of $1,000.00."

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code.

At trial, the trial judge held that the officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single vehicle accident was obliged to report accidents that had not been reported. The doctor prepared a medical report on October 30, 1987. That report included the results of the blood alcohol tests from the first blood sample and diagnosis the accused was intoxicated at the time of being treated in the emergency department.

8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the action was commenced, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court was satisfied sufficient change can occur within the context of an order under s. 37(1) such that it is in the best interests of the child to make such an order. The Ministry failed to show that they had taken measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father. The Court found that both parents were genuinely committed to the children's welfare and that their involvement with the children was necessary to ensure their continued safe care. There was no adult person able or willing to provide for their needs and the children were exposed to emotional and physical harm as a result of the trauma they had been exposed to."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","HELD: The application was granted in the alternative and the plaintiff was required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. The court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. The plaintiff relied on cases such as Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, which set out the principles for determining whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the defendant's head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. There were requests for answers to those undertakings culminating in the application. The stage of litigation is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. The defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is prejudice to the defendant."

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. It is in the Court's view that the ongoing support payments are currently being paid towards. Given that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay reasonable payment. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrear, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the rescission application to proceed, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay arreaars and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 3) The Court dismissed the respondent's application for rescission. It appears that the applicant has the ability to pay support in some of the years since the order was granted. He was stubborn. The applicant provides no evidence as why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002, and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his own behalf and by his son-in-law were at variance in material ways. The accused was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats when the alleged victim, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, approached him and punched him in the face. The victim fell to the ground and remained motionless. Less than one minute later the victim was run over and killed by a truck. HELD: The Court held that the jury must conclude that the accused driving was the contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 1) The Court expressly stated that Nurse was incorrectly decided. 2) While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The defendant placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The Court also held that there was a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the death. They are, to quote the Samueluelson decision, 'closely related in time and otherwise'. 3) In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it is very important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have to prove that the primary or secondary causes of death (e.g. the punch in the stomach, the disinterested testimony of the two disinterested witnesses) that led the jury to conclude the kick was a contributing cause and not just a minor or insignificant cause. 4) In the case at bar, two questions must be posed: (1) would the victim have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him; (2) was the assault a contributing factor in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause; (3) would there have been a pile-up if the assault had not taken place less than 45 seconds to one minute after the assault? The third question should be answered in the affirmative. The second question was asked in relation to the third party. The third unrelated witness, Mark Anderson, did not see the event."

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is not admissible. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court decided based on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 330 (O. C.A.). 2) The court found that s.810 hearings are not criminal trials. The court held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s.30 of the Canada Evidence Act. It held that the Crown must establish that the informant actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him and that there are reasonable grounds for the fear. 3) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for a criminal trial to be admitted into evidence. The Court found that'satisfied by the evidence adduced' does not require formal sworn evidence such as viva voce evidence commonly used in criminal proceedings. 4) The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted. The Crown sought to have these documents admitted. 5) The accused's application was dismissed. 6) Hearsay evidence was not admitted. 7) The applicant was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she or he actually feared that she would suffer personal injury. 8) Hearing transcripts were not admitted as part of the hearing. 9) The application to admit the accused's case to the National Parole Board was granted. 10) The admission of the transcripts was not allowed. 11) Section 810 does not create an offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. 12) The burden of proof is on the Crown and requires proof on a balance of probabilities. The test is both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears a bodily harm to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the informant's fear. The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. 13) The principles of review are correctness. They are not meant to be used to make a decision. 14) An application to extradite"
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment as well as the sentence imposed because the Crown did not object to his cross-examination. The only issue on appeal was whether it was the appellant who was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and his admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2)The appellant raised a number of valid objections. The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred. 3)The defence did not place any weight on the questions or in any way shift the onus of proof to the accused. 4)In all of the circumstances the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an alcohol problem was put in issue. 5)The Court was not satisfied that the Crown should not have put these questions in issue and therefore failed to do so. The trial judge clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, for an appeal to succeed on this ground, this Court must conclude that the appellant was prejudiced by the questions."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender and that the defendant not be eligible for programing if he did not accept responsibility for the sexual assaults. He also argued that the Court was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. Appeal dismissed; the defendant was found to be a danger offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment. The evidence showed that defendant's risk to re-offend was substantial and that if he continued to vacillate between accepting and denying responsibility he would not benefit from treatment."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and the wife to return certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage, and she needed spousal support. The husband, who maintained a modest pension and investment income, had to live with relatives. He applied to have the home sold and wife's equity divided equally after deducting legal fees and real estate commission from the sale proceeds; and to have bank release him from mortgage obligations. Application allowed; the matter could not be heard again. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. He has a room mate to share expenses. This generates some rental income. The farming operation has shown a loss in each year. The respondent notes that when the petitioner recently sought financing for the purchase of a half ton truck he indicated his income was $5,100 per month. The farm income is said to be $21,834.00. The Maintenance Enforcement Office is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983, S.S. 1983, c.R-4.1 as am. 2) It appears that by early 2006 there was $1,300. He was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately one-half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However one cannot ignore the fact that in 1992 the payor agreed to a rate that is greater than his current obligation. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 3) The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further to impute income, the Court will not consider costs. 4) The Court was cognizant of the fact the petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. 5) Costs were considered."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, in a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be planned and deliberate. The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. He seeks to set aside the certificate, which has been registered as judgment of this Court, on the same basis that the Court would open up noting for default or set aside default judgment. The Director takes the position that the applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion. HELD: 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62.4(1)(a). There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. The registered letter clearly stipulates that should the applicant wish to appeal he must take certain steps within 21 days. 2) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that it could be found the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for a default and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. However, virtually any judgment is set aside with merely a bald assertion by an applicant that he did not appreciate the seriousness or impact of the documentation served upon him. Simply stating that, 'I thought my letter of April 21, 2008 would be sufficient...' and 'I did not realize that had to take further action' is not sufficient explanation for his failure to meet the criteria. The fact that the document appeared to be formal in nature and upon receipt the applicant most certainly ought to have taken measures to determine what it was that he needed do as result of being served with that document. The document itself contained all the information the applicant would have needed to process the appeal."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling which held that the Government had no authority to create an individualized payment schedule for physician services. He argued the payment schedule was best characterized by a unilateral amendment of the Payment Schedule, which allowed the Government to request more information about the services underpinning the accounts and in appropriate situations to deny payment. The Government cross-appealed, arguing both the Protocol and the MCIA code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. The Protocol is not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). However, the reality is that most physicians have the option of either working wholly outside the publicly funded health care plan, billing patients directly or having the patients seek reimbursement from the Government or submitting accounts directly to the Government for payment. Most physicians opt for the third approach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross appeal dismissed. Both the appeal and the appealeal must be dismissed.  1) The principles of the Protocol are best characterized as 'a means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. Such matters, according to the physician, can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s. 49.2 of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations (the Regulations). 2) In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician Services in Saskatchewan. 3) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. The aspects of the protocol relating to the AU code operationalize that right in the circumstances of the physician's unusual practice. In this case, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so. 4) The payment schedule is best characterized, perhaps among other things, as a central feature of the payment regime. It does not lead to the imposition of tariffs or increased costs. 5) The application of the standard protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules' portion of the Schedule. The standard rules in this regard do not create special rules that are not found in"
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment was made under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that there had to be an 'air of realty' to the Plaintiff's argument as she had not been able to establish that the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; judgment entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed.  1)It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The Court must be cautious in assessing the likely recovery of a plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is a lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary. 2)The evidence submitted by way of the plaintiff's affidavits causes the Court difficulty. If the plaintiff stopped abruptly and there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to her claim, one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application for summary judgement. 3)The Plaintiff's injuries were minor. On reading the reports of her doctor and the doctor's report, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the health of the Plaintiff. There must be an air of reality to the defendant's arguments. 4)Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial. The Defendant argues there has yet to even be an independent medical examination. 5)Costs in the cause of the action were entered against both parties."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. The two older children stay with their mother when they are away from their school, and the parties' two younger children move in with her each week. HELD: The children have been in the respondent's custody and primary care for most of their lives. There is no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The court will retain jurisdiction to make final disposition regarding all corollary issues and with respect to child support and costs. 1) The respondent's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money. The Court accepted his evidence that he did not help with the care of the children particularly during the marriage when they were attending university. 2) There was considerable disagreement between the parents regarding the custody arrangements. It would be in the best interests of the child to remain in the custody of their mother and to have custody arrangements in place knowing that it was only an Interim Order.  3) The court was asked to determine the views of the parties regarding their living arrangements and to take into account the willingness of the petitioner to facilitate such contact. The judge generally provides the Court with recommendation based on her interviews. The evidence is just one of many factors that the Court takes into account when determining what is in the children’s best interests. 4) The parties were awarded joint custody of the four children under the terms of the Divorce Act and the 'best interests' test in that it is an objective test, albeit one which is to be applied according to the evidence in the case."
d_2000skqb366.txt,"The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s.65 of the Queen's Bench Act and Queen's Bench Rule 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondents from producing and manufacturing potassium sulphate near Alsask until further order; an order restraining the respondent from selling, marketing, or disposing of the potassium sulphate for profit until further order; other ancillary relief; costs of the application. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The plaintiff sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the defendant from marketing and manufacturing potassium sulphate and restraining the two defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization and that it had deliberately failed to obtain sufficient assurances that Big Quill's system was efficient enough for its needs. HELD: The defendant was prohibited from marketing or selling any potassium sulfate produced at the plaintiff's plant pursuant to the Technology Licensing Agreement and pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule No. 387(a). The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the defendant Alsask entered into the technology licensing agreement in 1997 with the view to considering the defendant's application. The evidence obtained by the plaintiff is that it only obtained documentation in 1995 sufficient to confirm the design of the plant and the flow charts of the process being used to produce the potassium sulphates. The plaintiff was also aware prior to the commencement of the action that it would not be having the defendant market its product to the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiff was aware at the time that it was being approached by the defendant that it might be possible for the defendant to develop a new technology that could be used to meet his or her marketing needs."

The respondent applies for leave to cross-examine him on his affidavit. HELD: The application for certification is granted. The court has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6(d) of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that cross-examination on an affidavit will not result in an injustice to the respondent. There are a number of statements contained in the respondent's affidavit that invite clarification. Taken as a whole, they are relevant to issues that must be determined by the Court under ss.6 and 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The issues to be resolved on certification application are complex and trial of an issue is not practical alternative where there is conflict in the evidence. However, the desirability of providing a complete picture of the proposed action, including the scope of the issues raised both in the claim and in defence, has generally been viewed by the courts as helpful in determining whether class action is the preferable route."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of the product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The applicant argued that this was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and awarding the appellant's costs, that in order to be eligible for exemption from health services taxes pursuant to s. 10(1)(h)(i) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of product actually being produced for sale. Machinery or equipment used prior or subsequent to that actual transformation is not eligible for the tax exemption. The essence of the decision was that as part of the refrigeration process only, a significant part of its processing was used, he could exempt that portion and tax the rest. The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. The respondent's contention that the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption in full was rejected. It was inappropriate to apportion the tax to be refunded if the equipment is exempt and is used in any degree in the manufacturing process."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one count of driving over the legal limit in violation of s. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The accused argued that his Charter rights were breached because he displayed an out of date sticker on his vehicle. The officer had engaged the police lights in the city and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the accused. The police officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 p.m. on a routine check. He made the demand for samples of his breath, read him his charter rights, asked him if he wished to call a lawyer and found the officer was not acting in the lawful execution of his duty and found that the words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers are employed within the province. On these facts, the accused blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests and on the three tests. The Court concluded that both offences were charges and that both accused were entirely within the scope of their duties."

HELD: The Crown's position that the liability of $250,053, $0 assets and the ability to pay by the respondent was relevant, but the guilty pleas represented either a waiver or an acceptance that these defences and limitations did not apply to his liability under s. 242 of the ITA nor the sentence to be imposed pursuant to S. 238 of the Act. The Crown need not establish the existence of the matters set out in s. 227.1(2). The evidence and submissions did not reveal whether the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was concluded that the accountant and the investor were relying upon an investor of H.R.P.S. and/or the accountant of that company to make the deductions and necessary remittances and that suggests either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more, responsible for these offences."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The second application was granted in part. The defendants argued that there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those that would permit a termination of the order. HELD: The preservation order was terminated and the statement of claim amended.  1)The application to add the plaintiff was dismissed.  2)The Court was not satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The failure to prosecute an action without delay could call for the termination of a preservation order. There are certainly circumstances in which a failure by a plaintiff to prosecute its claim without delay would cause a delay of at least 3 years. However, not every delay meets that mark. The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay, in the context of the legislation and in the circumstances of the application.  3)In the first application the defendants applied on the basis that it engaged s. 20 of The Limitations Act. They were correct to do so. The amendment would have allowed the addition of the plaintiff and the escrow agent, as escrow agents, to take part in the preservation proceedings. 4)The preservation order remained in effect until the court rendered a final decision on the merits of the applicant's claim against the defendant and after a hearing scheduled for June 2016. 5)The amendments would not create a wholly new proceeding.  6)The court was also required to exercise its discretion to order the plaintiff added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) the Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered to determine whether the officer was entitled to rely on the results of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable and possible grounds to arrest the respondent when he knew there was a possibility that the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the administrationof the test and that if she had, the result of the test could be inaccurate."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff has applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (Clarke) answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There is no implied waiver of litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of a sketch. The Court found that when an expert takes the witness stand or the expert's file is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver that the information in the plaintiff's file which is foundational to the opinion is not an issue. 2) The Court determined that the matter of railcars previously loaded by Clarke is not within the proper Scope of questioning. The court found that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so, and any implied waiver must be restricted to material relating to the formulation of the expressed opinion."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties.

The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the applicant as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered that the solicitor withdraw as counsel and that the applicant should return as counsel to the parties by April 28, 2006. 1) The court found that the conflict in the facts was apparent at the initial application. The parties were given leave to file additional evidence on the issues which were in conflict.

e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads:Article XII - Indemnity Clause CUPE Local 59 shall pay the cost of Defending an action against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union in the course of his or her duties. The Union counterclaim against the plaintiff for breach of the indemnity by-law is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 2) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified: the indemnity clause was not intended to be used to initiate actions but rather to defend actions or proceedings; and 3) the plaintiff was not an executive officer at the relevant time or was not acting in his/her duties as an Executive Officer when he made the comments and published the material for which he is being sued. The argument between the plaintiff and the union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual in nature; namely, is the plaintiff entitled to the benefits of an indemnity clause in the Union by-laws? 4) The dispute widens to an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. In short, this is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. 5) The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff”s claim and his application under Queen Bench Rule485 for summary judgment.

Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","The accused, who was charged with the charge of murder, applied for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights had been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by the case. The accused had not had the benefit of a preliminary inquiry as a result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him. There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. The defence argued that because the case had been so closely related to other incidents that it was impossible for the accused to get a fair trial by an impartial jury. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity, filled as it was with prejudicial and inflammatory information, had not prejudiced the accused's right to be tried by a fair jury of his peers. 2)The applicant had not established on a balance of probabilities that his right to a free and fair jury trial had been violated. 3)The application for an injunction restraining the execution of the application was made on the basis of prejudicial comments and images in the media. 4)The Court was satisfied that there was an apprehension of bias such that it would reasonably be expected to affect a potential juror's impartiality. However, until it is known to what extent this information has affected the potential jurors, the issue remained speculative. 5)It was not possible to determine whether the accused had been prejudiced because of all the negative publicity. 6)The court was also required to consider whether there had been an adverse effect on the general populous climate of fear which made the selection of a jury impossible."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and with intent to commit an indictable offence, having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for more than 10 months at the time of their convictions. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal set a sentence of two years to be served in federal penitentiary as well as two years of probation in the circumstances. 2) The sentences are in their proper perspective for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence. 3) The accused's criminal records, which have been appalling, show failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The sentence imposed on each of them takes into account their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed vehicle chase ensued after the robbery on a major thoroughfare in the City of Regina, with the getaway vehicle approaching speeds of 100 kms per hour and driving through red lights."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling was completely black with smoke and flames. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not working at the time of the fire. The smoke detector in the plaintiff's apartment was not functioning properly. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; there were no beeping noises coming from the smoke alarm system. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant breached the standard of care owed to the plaintiffs by failing to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between a landlord and the tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendants owed a duty of caring to the plaintiff to ensure their were reasonably secure from injury by residing in their premises. This would include the installation and maintenance of an operational fire system. The defendant was also subject to statutory obligations. The residential Tenancies Act sets out statutory conditions that apply to all residential leases including the requirement to keep the premises in good state of repair and to comply with any statutes regarding safety. The National Fire Code required the installation of an 'operating fire alarm' system which must be tested yearly. Also, yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. In the circumstances the plaintiff was injured, the damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities."

The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope that he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future. 2)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and he is paying very reasonable rent and food expenses are very reasonable (he is single with no dependents). The net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for a single person. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she not be impaired by alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is not enough to prove impaired ability to operate a motor vehicle."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","HELD: The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and acquitted him. On all of the evidence, I am convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Crown has the burden throughout the case to prove the constituent elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt with credible evidence. The Court cannot accept the explanation offered by the defendant that he was looking for a moose caller when he was driving through the forest. All of the indicia of hunting at night with the use of a searchlight are present in this case. It cannot escape notice that there were two loaded firearms in the vehicle; cannot accept that the rifle that was in the back seat of the truck was loaded with 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber, four live rounds in the magazine, and 14 rounds of ammunition were compatible with the two rifles that were seized. There are some uncontroverted facts, all of which are consistent only with an inescapable inference that the defendant was employing the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife."

3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with aggravated assault, being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm and being in possession of a weapon which had been stolen from two residences. The accused also entered into plea agreements with the co-accused and the defence. The sentencing judge found that the accused had a less than perfect upbringing as a child and had a fair amount of instability in his years of life. The pre-sentence report prepared by the Crown recommended a sentence of four years to a maximum of five years, as well as a 10 year prohibition from the possession of weapons. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration, as opposed to the 10 years already imposed for breaking and entering. The defence sought to rationalize the range of sentences imposed for home invasions, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to take into account the aggravating circumstances of the accused's previous offences, particularly his failure to alert the appropriate parties to obtain assistance for the victim. HELD: The appropriate sentence was for the home invasion, having regard to all of the factors that go into the calculation of the sentence: four years for the offence of break and enter under s. 348.1(b) of the Code, a life imprisonment sentence for common assault, a two-year prohibition from possessing a weapon for the same purpose, and 10 years for common break and enters. The sentences imposed were based on the factors set out in the Code that the Crown had reviewed prior to making the determinations in the case of this case. The evidence was extensive, the accused readily admitted his culpability and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of the other accused and the defendant was found guilty of a similar count in relation to similar offences committed in the same area. There was no evidence to support the Crown's argument that the evidence was unreliable and the accused should be given credit for time already served."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The delay of 17 minutes from the time that the police officer first observed the open bottle of alcohol in the vehicle to the complainant was not reasonable and practical. The respondent was detained because he was locked in the police vehicle and he could not exit. During the 17 minutes between the stop and the roadside demand, the officer noted an odour of alcohol from the accused and made a demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath, both readings being 120 mgs. In the instant case, it appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than a just charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short period of time, that might have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. However, what the officer chose to do was have the respondent wait in the car while he conducted a search of his vehicle because the search was being conducted at the side of the road. This caused a delay of approximately 17 minutes and the accused was given no right to counsel."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the home had flooded 12 years ago. Later the Defendants moved back in and the neighbours burned out their shop vac cleaning up water in the basement. When the baseboards were removed, mould was on two different walls neither of which was the furnace room nor the exercise room. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall below the windows. The parties were required to carefully examine the property and have it inspected by an independent party or parties to verify the above information. At issue was whether the claimant's claim was sufficiently advanced to warrant a non-suit. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law manner. It was not the function of the decision maker to tell the litigants who they should call as witness or whether they should provide evidence of their knowledge of the present state of the property. The decision was made with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. 1)The court reviewed the law on motions for non-suits and found that most of the time it is not necessary to decide whether a claim is sufficiently advanced or too advanced for a court to impose its own warranties. 2)There was a fine balance between an adversarial process and an inquisitional process that raises itself often in Small Claims Court proceedings. 3)The decision to dismiss the motion was not made to lessen the court's ability to make a case for the claim. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. Many of us have no experience with the courts because we have abided by the law. It is not the common person's responsibility to impose a sufficiency test in the circumstances of a case such as this one. The test is whether there was insufficient evidence, if believed, to satisfy a reasonable person that the case could be resolved in the appellant's favour. 4)The doctrine of merger has been softened considerably in the sale of goods due to legislative intrusion but that has yet to take place with the sales of real property and it should not be up to the Court to impose such a test."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death his company changed over to a single quota system known as Total Production Quota (TPQ). Therefore any sales after that date were under the new quota scheme. The plaintiff argued that the agreement only refers to the Fluid Milk Quota and therefore it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the sold version of the quota and not all quota sold. The defendant agreed to split the proceeds three ways. First, it was agreed that all three brothers would get a share of the sale proceeds. The second, the agreement was not binding on any of the plaintiffs. The third, and the most important issue was the sharing of proceeds from a sale of only one quota. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that the three brothers and their company were obligated to share proceeds only from sales of only the one quota sold and that all other quota sold should be retained by the actual milk producer. The parties agreed that the quota would be transferred to the new company and that if the quota was disposed of prior to 2003 it would be shared equally among the brothers. The agreement was based on the terms of the previous agreement which clearly indicated that they and their father had agreed that they would have joint ownership of all the milk quota owned by the company and the Market Share Quota. The fourth, and perhaps the most significant issue, was the possibility of a tax consequences resulting from the reorganization of the parent company. Granting the plaintiffs the costs of interpreting the agreement, that the plaintiffs were entitled to a share in any sale of any quota sold, regardless of whether the quota is changed or not."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault contrary to s. 235. HELD: 1) The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The evidence was found to be admissible on a principled basis with respect to the admissibility of the first two incidents as well as the hearsay statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers. There was a risk that the evidence would distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the actus reus and has the requisite procedural safeguards to ensure threshold reliability. Similar fact evidence is presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial."
5_2002nsca108.txt,"The applicant grandparent applied to the Court of Appeal to be made a party to the proceeding so that she could appeal a permanent care order made in respect of her granddaughter. Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.","The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The paternal grandmother was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The Family Division placed the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax. The grandmother found out about the order after the fact, and found out that the Society had wrongly shut her out of the process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her before the order was made. The applicant sought to add a party for the purposes of bringing an appeal. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Chambers judge does not have the authority to make the order sought. The authority of the Chambers judge depends on an express or implied grant of power in a rule or enactment and should not be interpreted as conferring jurisdiction. There are a number of issues of fact which the Court would not make an order as, in its opinion, an application to the Family Court for leave to terminate the permanently care order appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for the applicant to proceed. Nothing which have been said in the material filed would persuade the Court to dismiss the application."

E. E.(Saskatchewan), 1992 CanLII 8071 (SK QB), or on the application to the evidence before him.  2)An appeal court should not interfere with the findings of fact by a trial judge unless the findings are not supported by the evidence or the conclusions reached by the trial judge are clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The learned trial judge provided written reasons wherein he carefully reviewed the applicable principles of law and applied them to the case.

c_1995canlii6136.txt,"The Plaintiff applied for payment out of certain monies paid into court in response to 3 garnishee summons served on 2 garnishees after judgment. The first summons was never served on the Defendant. Of the other 2, only 1 was served on the Defendant. Further, although 1 garnishee was only served twice, it paid monies into court on 5 occasions. There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application. HELD: Application allowed. 1)The court has an inherent power to control its own process in garnishment proceedings. 2)The court also has the discretion to order the payment of the money to the plaintiff as a judgment creditor. 3)The chambers judge ordered that the monies held in court to the credit of this cause be paid to the plaintiff, but made no order as to costs.","The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s. 14 of The Attachment of Debts Act to pay out to her certain monies paid into court by the Royal Bank of Canada and by Martindale Holdings Ltd. plus the interest thereon plus the respondent's judgment. Sokulski was personally served with notice of this application but did not appear. The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. The respondent was served with the garnishee summons twice. The judgment was registered as judgment for Saskatchewan July 7, 1987. The amount paid out by both garnishees was $383.71. Interest accrued to the plaintiff was not accrued. The chambers judge erred by freezing the money already paid into Court under the invalid garnisihee summons pending resolution of the trial of the action. HELD: The plaintiff was directed to pay the monies out of court to the defendants.  1)The chambers judge did not make any errors in law.  2)The plaintiff succeeded at trial and recovered judgment from which an appeal has now been dismissed today. If the defendants had brought this garnishment appeal forward, the court would have resisted the order to make payment available to them. However, the Chamber judge did make a proper error in making the payment available in the first instance.  3)There were a number of deficiencies in the procedure adopted. First, the respondent was never served with one of the two pre-judgment garnishas. With respect to the Lumsden Hotel, there was evidence it was served on two occasions with a garnishhee summons, but it paid money into court on five occasions. There was no application by the judgment debtor to set aside the judgment and if no appeal is taken the funds, including any accrued interest, will be paid to each of the defendants after the time for appeal."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion costs in the amount of $50,000 to the plaintiff on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $25,000.00. The plaintiff filed an Offer to Settle in 1993 and the trial was held two years later. The Defendant then withdrew the counterclaim. The Court concluded that double recovery results from the accident and that the appropriate rate of interest to be applied is 2.5%. This practice was followed by the Appeal Division in cases where the findings of fault relate to the happening of the event causing the accident rather than to any aggravation of the injuries or failure to mitigate their effect. In this case, the Court found that a double recovery resulted."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previously planned international calibre soccer field which had been abandoned by the city and instead proceeded with some playing fields. Turf Masters bid on and obtained the subcontract without being aware of the two consultants' reports regarding site problems as these were not included or otherwise disclosed during the tendering and contract process. Shortly after commencing the work, the City and the plaintiff commenced an action against the city, alleging negligent misrepresentation and breach of standard of care, and claiming indemnity and negligent misrepresentations. The plaintiff commenced a second action in which it claimed the city's negligence had been decided by a combination of the trial judge's and the Court of Appeal's decisions in the first action and the trial of the second action. In this action, the plaintiff requested certain paragraphs of the defendant's defence be struck out pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25 on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The second application was also dismissed. HELD: The Court granted the application and dismissed the second application. 1)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to both applications. While it is not technically necessary to decide this matter, the Court could say that it would have no hesitation in deciding the matter itself. 2)On the issue of the 'first action' it is clear that the defendant should have raised the point now asserted in the plaintiff's first action (quantum meruit) based on the non-disclosure of the soil reports. It appears to have been well aware that the factual basis for the present allegation was not litigated in the original fashion. It is common ground that the two site evaluation reports prepared by the defendant were not provided to the plaintiff prior to the bidding, obtaining and entering into into the contract. The City had abandoned the idea of an international caliber soccer field after concluding it could not afford such a field. The increased potential damage pool as a result of the application did not constitute new facts which could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. 3)Costs of the first and second application were awarded to both parties."

Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. It was common ground that the respondent's 1996 income included the following: employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy. She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment was sporadic and it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month is fair for the current determination of maintenance. If there is a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent. The respondent is supporting the oldest child, Brianna, who resides with his mother in Regina and accordingly the petitioner must support her. In terms of child support, at an income level of $38,000 the respondent should pay $1,165 per month for three children or $388 per month per child. Given the petitioner's modest revenue, it is reasonable to expect he should pay thatamount without any abatement of her income."

The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before me was whether the court was liable to pay the defendant's outstanding account.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. In 1986 the appellant carried out an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with the view to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people. That company could not be considered an existing jobber business. The trial judge held that the clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact, which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. The appellant was forced into the position that it had no intention of applying the provisions of s. 4.02 and s. 6.01. With hindsight, the appellant cannot contend that Ritchie's forecast was relieved because of the existence of Yarmouth Equipment. The franchise agreement contained an exclusionary clause which prevented the appellant from disclosing information to the respondent about the potential profitability of the franchise."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc.

The application was deferred to permit the Court to deal with the substance of the matters raised by the parties already before the Court. HELD: The appeal was granted with costs to the respondents. 1) The majority of the facts deposed to in the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents are based on information and belief. While there has been some public concern expressed about the possible environmental effect of new technology that is concerned with resource utilization and that may induce significant environmental change, that concern is not wide-spread. 2) The affidavit evidence filed by the respondents is based on conjecture, speculation and hearsay with no basis in fact.

The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.

The settlement proceeds into Court in accordance with the terms of the order. It is not offensive to direct the applicant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court.

The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means.

Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. Although the applicant did not deny the factual information provided in the Minister's supporting affidavit, she should have provided it at the protection hearing, otherwise she must accept all of the allegations as proof of the protection finding pursuant to section 22(2) (k). HELD: The order of production was granted. The documents requested will not be produced for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the orders made. Costs will be placed on service providers who are asked to produce only relevant records or to prepare report or answer interrogatories. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. The question of whether something affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial)acquired title to house property and caused to be affixed bolted by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for that purpose wheelchair lift loaned to the Jabours by the Abilities Council for use of their disabled foster child. The title was transferred to both the plaintiff and the third party. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the Realty notwithstanding how it was affixed thereto. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of that realty and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that is affixed is a feature in a realty such as that of the parties. 2)Although it was not a finding of the trial judge that the manner of attaching the wheelchair lift, i.e. only to the concrete slab, arguably showed an intention that it showed an interest that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the judge. 3)In the circumstances, the appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff/third party and the fourth party."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four grandchildren were named after the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 1) The written instructions by the defendant to prepare four cheques of $5,000 each for the benefit of the four granddaughters constituted a trust. The plaintiff retained the money in 1992 as the mother's bank account. In 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. In 1998, Mabel's cancer was terminal. She died on March 24, 1998 at which time there was still $25,000 in the bank account in the joint names of the plaintiff and the defendant. 2) In 1992, the defendant placed $17,500 in the name of the mother. The following Sunday, Pennefather died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. 3) In 1995 the defendant divested himself of any interest in the stocks and Royal Trust company was trustee for Daisy. However, it was noted at the end of the statement that the trustee was not a volunteer but rather a 'volunteer' not having given any consideration to either Royal Trust or Royal Trust companies which would create an equity in her favour. 4) An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer."

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","An appeal of the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had been served with hearing notice and received written particulars of his claim for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing, the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. He argued that he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appeal was patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the facts. 2)The rentalsman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not unreasonable given that evidence."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child residing with the mother and the father, David no longer lives with either parent. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, which is his new employment. 2) The parties have agreed to a split custody arrangement whereby the father is to pay support for two children based on an income of $140,000 for the months from May to August 2009. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no year to year capital gain unless the father has gains on other property."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The parties appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. In all of the circumstances, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. However, we do wish to affirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). Another ground of appeal was that the judge erred in finding an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The defendant commenced an action for breach of contract against the plaintiff in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The plaintiff did not file a defence and the defendant obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The parties appeared before the judge for hearing on the issue of whether the Alberta Court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the defendant. The adjudicator determined that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court has jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to Section 15 of the act. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process, the defendant did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to bring an appeal from orders made in September 1999 and October 1st, 1999. The Union argued that there was an arguable issue within the meaning of s. 44 of the Judicature Act and that the matter put before the Supreme Court in the initial Ex-Parte Interim Application and placed again on the return date of September 30th, 1999 was a 'labor-management dispute'. The Union sought to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 or Rule 8. The Court dismissed the application for the continuation of the injunction on the ground that the Union did not have the status to file an appeal pursuant to either of the Rules. Rule 8 is not relied upon by the Union. It is the proper forum to enable both parties to adduce evidence in support of their respective opposed submissions. In the absence of any affidavits filed on behalf of the Union before Justice Tidman supporting any submission to join the Union under Rule 7, or Rule 5, or any other Rule, the Union's application for an extension of time and place of service was dismissed as a result of the applications presently before the Court.

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.

1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child could qualify for assistance, she was not the head of family maintaining a home for herself and a dependent child. The evidence did not establish that the appellant was a person in need within the definition of 'expectant mothers' under Municipal Social Assistance Policy 1.2.5'. The fact that she was an expectant mother and living in the home of her parents was not sufficient to qualify her for assistance. Rather, the appellant's application was based on an eligibility category for 'expecting mothers', which in this case included the unwed mother of a child."

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that morning until his sister was able to arouse him and he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society as described in ss. (2) and (3d) 1. It was difficult to understand how a person who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sex that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina, but the Court found that such a defence was not supported by the evidence subsequently adduced by the defence. There was no case that analyses the second condition described in R. v. Daviault (1996), 46 C.R. (4th) 124 (Ont. C.A.)."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,"The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial'.  1)Had the accused been permitted to continue to picket or carry placards pending his trial, he would have been restricted to lawful activity. 2)The picketing was reasonably prudent in the circumstances and nature of the case. The provisions of the interim release order were reasonably satisfied as well as those of the criminal justice system. 3)If the amendment was not made he would restrict his picketing to lawfulactivity."
b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given inthe examination for discovery of the plaintiff and ordered that the documents be of minimal use, even of no relevance, in resolving the issues raised by the pleadings. HELD: The order of the Court was that the plaintiff should seek the designation of a case-management judge in the action and that the defendants should provide the plaintiff with the specific information requested.  1)The plaintiff failed to provide proper answers to the questions posed by the defendants. 2)The defendants were ordered to produce all of the documents requested. 3)Costs were to be determined by the trial judge on the basis of the divided success in considering both in tandem."

Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited.

The monies paid into Court before this Rule 15 application launched will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. The appellant's non-appearance at the hearing did not have the benefit of any evidence or submissions from the appellant. The judge decided the application on the evidence before him.  1) The appellant might well have brought an application in Queen’s Bench under rule 271. Any verdict or judgment obtained, where one party does not appear at trial, may be set aside by the court upon such terms as may be just, upon an application made within 15 days after the trial. This would have been more expeditious procedure. 2) The appeal that can be expedited is made under rule 15 with stay granted to all matters relating to this matter except for the enforcement proceedings."
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(b) and 10(c) had be infringed. HELD: The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. The accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact a particular Legal Aid duty counsel."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a subtenant. The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining REAL from interfering with the defendant's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises including the Jubilee Building as tenant from and after September 1, 1996. REAL was not aware of the sublease and was not asked to provide its consent, as required by the lease and the first sublease. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted.  1)The applicant had entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to terminate the lease but there was no promise on the part of REAL that it would follow up on these discussions nor was there any discussion about waiving any requirements with respect to its exercising the option to renew either through the defendant or directly.  2)There was no evidence that the parties met once to discuss the future of the hotel. The parties met only once. 3)The defendant had undertaken a new course of conduct for bingo at the Exhibition Park. 4)The plaintiff was not able to show that the defendant, the party with whom REAL had contracted, exercised or attempted to exercise the option."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order (which was amended on a couple of occasions) for the investigation of the securities of Knowledge House Inc. Mr. Potter applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails, documents and other information obtained during the investigation to him. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the applicant's's's application. The parties then argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been entertained. The respondent argued that he should have taken his complaints to the Court, not to the Courts, because the Court had not yet considered the appropriateness of his application on this interlocutory appeal. HELD: The Court granted leave to appeal and instructed the Court to continue the application until the matter is resolved in the Court's favour.  1)The Court found that s. 29A of the Act does not clearly take away the power of the superior courts to order disclosure. The Act provides that investigative material be kept confidential unless the Commission or the Court grants permission for its release. The Commission appears to have the power and the tools to address the issues of solicitor-client privilege.  2)The respondent was a person directly affected by the Commission's investigation orders and, in particular, by the way the investigation authorized by those orders has been conducted. He alleges serious impropriety on the part of the investigators and that they required a warrant issued by a judge under s27(5) to obtain his email records. While the substance of the privilege issue is pure question of general law, the issue is how to balance the interests of the courts in the field of securities regulation in the public interest. A number of administrative and practical issues to be addressed, such as how the investigation should respond to the risk that privileged materials have been obtained, how the Commission should have invoked the process under s29F(3) to permit disclosure of 'any information or evidence obtained' and in forwarding information to the RCMP, thereby tainting the process."

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to have the parties share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent had since unilaterally moved the children to Bridgewater, one hour from Halifax, changing their school, changed their after-school care and provided access to the children who resided in the same area as the parties. There had been some difficulty in the parties' communication regarding the move, especially with respect to the mother's opposition to the father's ability to exercise access. The mother had significant contact with both parties' families. The parties' ability to meet the children's needs as required by the Court Order was disrupted. The father had to pay child support of $238 per month for the two children, which was reduced to $25 per month as a result of the mother unilaterally moving the children from their school and after school care to Bridgewater.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a sentence for the accused. The Crown and the youth court argued that the conference should not be open to the public or the media. Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court include the media in its deliberations. The applicant argued that this was a public proceeding to which they should have access. Application dismissed; the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law is recognized to be an extraordinary remedy and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion. The evidence before the court rebutted the open court principle and supported an order pursuant to s.132 of the Act and the Supreme Court of Canada v.

c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid and further agreed 'the said payment shall continue until the wife remarried or died, whichever date occurs the sooner'. The agreement provided for an annual adjustment to the amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband continued to pay $1,000 per month until 1995, when the amount was unilaterally reduced by the applicant to $627.55 per month. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still has a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application was made twofold. Firstly, that the bankrupt received wrong legal advice concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly, that he thought the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He had yet to file monthly financial statements and had not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. 2)Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application to annulate the assignment. The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If the bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent personat the date of the assignment it would be dangerous for the trustee to order an annulment because he would have a precedent for filing an application like this which would set a dangerous precedent for another section of the Act which would result in the bankrupt having to re-examine his duties as a trustee in order to ensure his compliance with his obligations. 3)There were other actions by secured creditors returnable in Queen's Bench as early next week."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The issue was not plead in defence but on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs of $42,089.00 with costs of Column D of Tariff Of Costs. The court must be able to ascertain the probable value of the sprayer at the end of the Agreement, in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price is a'substantial sum' as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. The trade-in as the advance payment was not a nominal amount but the Agreement did not define it in that way. The plaintiff was to have possession and be entitled to make the final termination value payment ($9,320.67); the difference being $679.60 for 'past due interest' as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until Mr. Poirier elected to pay the final payment (which was $10,122.72 for 'principal' and $149.60 per excess hour) and the right to recover the unpaid purchase money is restricted to repossession and sale."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The Chambers judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's ultimate remedy should lie in damages as opposed to specific performance and urged the respondent to file its statement of defence and proceed to resolution without further delay. The order was immediately registered in January 2007 and the appellant’s miscellaneous Interest was discharged from title. Two grounds of appeal were raised: (1) the appellant possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel because he will never be successful in obtaining from this Court the remedy of specific performance in the circumstances of this case; (2) the Chambers judge did not err in the manner he did in calculating the registrarable interest; and (3) the application for registration of an interest was unsuccessful. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","HELD: The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. 1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a Victim surcharge in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. 2) The sentencing judge failed to comply with s. 730(1) of the Criminal Code or, alternatively, the explicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of Code. This sentencing judge has consistently and consistently raised the issue of undue hardship. This is particularly true where the maximum sentence for assault is 15 years imprisonment or more. The maximum surcharge for common assault is $30.3 per cent of the total sentence, which is the maximum imposed in the entire criminal justice system. This type of sentence represents a serious breach of the entire system of justice and represents an important breach of an important set of obligations that must be paid out of the taxpayer's pocket. 3) In this case, the sentencing judge raised the maximum amount of surcharges by example of 15 per cent, which the Respondent was to pay in the amount of $30, despite the fact that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s730(5). 4) The trial judge clearly and consistently failed to meet the statutory obligations that are attached to this type of sentencing. This applies particularly to financial hardship, particularly in the context of a sentence of 15 years or more where a maximum sentence of 21 years has been imposed."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, he considered whether the trial Judge's factual findings were entitled to deference and held that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of the appellant’s breath. 2)The evidence was clear that the respondent had slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. Even excluding those indicia, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provided ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 3)The court found that the verdict was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It was not clear if the appellant had fainted or had a cleft lip and considered that that may have affected his speech."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his section 7 rights. The voir dire resulted in the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident promptly. The officer concluded that the accused understood his rights, the warning and demand for the blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout'. However, he had no recollection of the officer ever placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC, 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321. The Crown conceded the accused had a legal obligation to report the accident, and if the accused believed he was Reporting the Accident when he gave self- incriminating statements, such statements would be excluded in order to ensure the accused has a fair trial. The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed not to concentrate on the motives behind the Charter violations. The case before us, the self- referencing statements that were made under compulsion of statute have been excluded. The police officer abandoned his previous investigation and accompanied the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the accused was also awaiting treatment for his injuries. HELD: The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's s.7 rights and must be excluded pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter. 1) The accused's statements were made in good faith. He did not know that he had a right to make these statements because he believed he had to under-curtain of statute. He was interrogating the accused after he had arrested him, explained what he was arrested for, explained to him his rights to counsel and further warned him he was not obligated to say anything further to the police. However, his recollection of being placed under arrest and given a warning were not made with the intent of making the demand. 2) The self- incriminating Statements were made over a period of time and were not admissiblinating. The statements in particular were self-injurious and conscriptive. The admission of guilt and the admission of liability for wrongful conduct by the police in connection to the wrongful conduct of an accused will generally be"
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. It was not an error of law on the part of the defendant. The trial judge was alive to the jurisprudence in raising the issue of whether a witness's testimony should be given to the jury in relation to the testimony of two witnesses. The defendant took the position that the fatal bullet had entered the plaintiff's head, striking the bottom of his right occipital bone and exiting above his right eye. The evidence in this case was that the defendant had asked the plaintiff to change the barrel of the handgun. The plaintiff had received $500 of the stolen money from a friend of the friend who had killed Mr. Byer, who had been employed as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician. He had been charged with the murder of his friend, who was killed in an isolated, abandoned farmyard in 2010. He retained different legal counsel for his appeal. The appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that a trial judge erred in law by failing to give the defendant a proper dose of warning. The appeal court also held that there was a risk that the evidence in tandem with the evidence might impair the credibility of the Crown witness who sought to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to pay $20,000 for expert costs. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $25,000 and the counterclaim was dismissed. HELD: The court has discretion. It does not allow a counterclaim to be filed and, in the circumstances, it would not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against it if the security was restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. In the present case, the plaintiff commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. It is reasonable to expect that the defendant will eventually decide to vacate the action and the costs which should be paid will be in the cause.  1) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act (supra) to have the defendant's lien vacated and it was now argued that the court has no jurisdiction to do anything more. 2) In this case the defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which was the other action. That was the result of a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff’s opportunity to defend the action. 3) The presence of the counter claim in this case does not preclude an order for security for cost. 4) In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made against the plaintiff. 5) The court reviewed the pleadings and the material filed. It was not seen as an absolute prohibition but rather a factor to be considered."

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for the offence, categorizes it as rape, and alleges there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the case. HELD: A lower sentence was justified. A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A three year threshold sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. The accused was prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. The fire arms were prohibited from being used for a ten year period. The sentences were to be served concurrently.  1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, I must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community.

The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. He was not hospitalized, never required surgery, and was by all accounts completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment. The plaintiff pressed for trial during the term of the Supreme Court in Kentville. His injuries were so severe that he was unable to work any longer. For the past two years, he had been paying down his farm loan and other debts, and had sold some special veneer logs. He had also been unsuccessful in obtaining a loan for $140,000 to the Farm Loan Board. He now sought and was granted leave to present his injury report to the trial judge. The court accepted the plaintiff's assertion that the injuries were such that he could not comfortably project any improvement. It was not enough for the plaintiff to urge that leave be granted because defence counsel was sufficiently skilled, prepared and experienced to deal with its late introduction. There was a burden of persuasion upon the defaulting party to show that the interests of justice would merit its late reception. The Court reviewed the history of successful sales of Christmas trees and sawmill equipment and found that most of the assets valued at their market value could be sold at their current market value to a single purchaser."
c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska was patently unreasonable. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere unless it was 'patently unreasonable.' The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable. Allowing the appeal, that the appeal is dismissed. The Chambers judge's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question was a perfectly rational one. It was not irrational for the Chambers judge to conclude that the phrase 'pursuant to' as the phrase is used in Article 16 does not mean 'according to' or 'consequent upon', or 'by reason of'. The reasonableness of the respondent's interpretation, which was not reasonable, was wiped out by the use of the phrase by the appellant."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, and the Application of s.54 of the LTA. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent's fee simple mortgage had priority over the appellant's mortgage. The respondent had agreed to a postponement in favour of the applicant. 2) The second FCC Mortgage, which was drawn by its solicitors, was not drafted as a registrable mortgage but only purported to charge 'his equity' as required by the terms of the instrument. 3) Up to the time of the filing of the caveat the situation was that both the appellant and the respondent had equitable mortgages upon the land. In the instant case, the respondent did not even know about, and certainly did not rely upon, the covenant to postpone contained in the Grant Agreement between the respondent and the appellant. The third parties are not affected and the M. should not be permitted to have its interests advanced over those of the FCC by virtue only of prior registration. 4) The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $6,000."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm on December 28, 2011. The three accused entered guilty pleas to using an imitation firearm while committing the offences of break and enter with intent to commit the assault on the victim. The victim of the assault was identified as Jesse Manulak, who was the resident of the dwelling house and the accused's step-father. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. HELD: A conclusion was reached that the accused should not be excused for their actions as a result of the defendant's potential fraud on them, and that Vigilante justice cannot be countenanced, even if the accused had a valid complaint. The accused were found to be at medium risk to re-offend, given the circumstances of the offence, and the fact that they had all been involved in the offence. The evidence showed that the defendant, who had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08, had a significant criminal record."

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60.

b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicates it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term of one year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the Fixed Term of One year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012.  2) The fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a Fixed Term. The decision to not advertise the unit for rent was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of the macro decisions can be attributed to the respondent. To put the matter in perspective, if the appellant had not chosen to make the change to furnished premises and had simply waited until November to start advertising the suite for rent, and had then waited until January to re-rent the unit, he would not have been able to prove entitlement to rent revenue loss. 3) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in finding the tenancy was not for fixed term. He concluded the tenant had not complained to the landlord about the noise was failure to mitigate and that he had done what was reasonable to minimize his loss. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to realizing he had decided to furnish the unit. This decision was appropriate on the facts of the case he was considering. The question in this matter for the hearing officer was would there be any loss if there was a loss, if it was done minimally, and accordingly if the tenant is entitled to compensation."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or for the purposes of breaching his Treaty right to fish for sustenance in accordance with s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by s.7 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1995, and whether the regulation violated his Treaty rights. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence showed that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that there was a significant difference between the words 'all fishing' and 'all feeding'. The Court ordered the closure of the commercial fishing co-op to be maintained and a reduction to the 5,000-kilogram quota for commercial and recreational fishing to apply only to commercial fishing and not to Treaty sustenance fishing rights."

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there has been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support.

Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. She has requested a 50% increase in support because her expenses for the same year are halved due to the shared cost of living, if those shared costs were reasonably accounted, and an increase is warranted."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant and respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. Both before and after the adoption of the Married Women's Property Act (MFPA), the husband remained under an obligation to support his wife, an obligation which was in principle lifelong. For several decades after its adoption, separate property worked reasonably well in large majority of cases. However, it was not always possible for the appellant to obtain a support order against her former partner on the breakdown of their same sex relationship. In the end, the respondent separated from the appellant. She successfully applied for a declaration under the MFPA that she had no right to any share of it on a marriage breakdown. Application dismissed; the applicant's claim for differential treatment was not based on a substantive difference in status but on a multiplicity of substantive and substantive differences between the parties. Both parties were entitled to equitable treatment."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys had special needs and were developmentally delayed. Their mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the grandsons to their care, alleging that they were being sexually assaulted by their maternal grandparents. The mother, who was receiving Social Assistance, sought custody of the boys. HELD: The children were placed with the Minister until the age of 18. 1) The Court was satisfied that the boys were in need of protection and concluded that the Stevens home met the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children. The Court ordered a permanent order placing the children with the Ministry. 2) The Children and Family Services Act set out clear objectives. The 1987 conviction was not the last brush with the law. The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. The physical plant of the home must present some challenges. However, the Court was of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age at which the child was born or other circumstances. There was also a risk that one of the children may be sexually assaulted. The evidence showed that the accused, who had a somewhat complex familial background, had a number of partners. He did not know he was the father of one child until approximately three years ago. 3) The boys were apprehended from the care of their paternal grandparents, A.H. (Art) and Laura (who were living with their mother). The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry's social services (who was paying for the boys' care at the time of the offence) had contact in the east who was in the modelling business. If that contact actually employed one of Art's children, then he would receive a $1,000 finder's fee at least once. The business ended in 1999. The father was paying child support and the children's school fees when they were in their early thirties. The family continued to reside in the home until they graduated high school and moved to the therapeutic foster home in 2007. It was clear that the home had a laissez-faire attitude and that it was important that the children be placed with their parents who were able to provide for their needs."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) the amount of cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking; 2) he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the offences for which he was being found guilty; and 3) there were six persons present in the trailer when the accused was arrested, there was no evidence that the drugs which were found were received from the accused. The accused has a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug possession charges. There is no evidence he has dealt effectively or perhaps at all with his drug addictions or dependancies. The facts do not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. The Court considered that the circumstances justify the maximum credit allowed pursuant to s. 719(3.1) of the Code."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support. 2)The mere passage of time would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The fact that the respondent was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application. 3)The present application is dismissed. There is no change to the material change in circumstances of custody. This is without prejudice to the respondent to bring an application to vary with respect to the same relief if supported by the appropriate financial disclosure and documentation. There are no costs awarded."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The application is dismissed and the defendant is entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the rules with respect to offers of settlement are applicable. 1) There is no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on the second most fundamental issue of the case, which is whether the standard of care that is applicable in a professional negligence case is breached. 2) The calling of a legal expert to provide opinion evidence is not a matter of convenience or choice for the plaintiff. The jury has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial. 3) The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated issue of whether the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of plaintiff's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence(s) (Ries Estate). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and judgment including knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer.  4) The court was awarded its costs of the motion in the context of column V. The court recognized the importance of calling expert evidence at trial where the issue is a matter beyond the ordinary competence of a trier of fact to decide, in that case, the trial judge's responsibility to decide."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown's application was granted on the basis of the res gestae exception. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.  1) The complainant's evidence is important to the Crown's case and there is no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. The statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile.  2) The Court found that the test of necessity has been met. The law is evolving and it is not only in situations where statements are recorded on video and taken under oath that there might be sufficient indicia of reliability. The test of reliability is met when a witness recants on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agree the exhibit is now under the control of the Attorney General and it is the appropriate respondent in this proceeding. HELD: The appropriate court to determine the issue of access is the Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. The court is the proper court to obtain such relief.  1) The presumption in favour of public access and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S. at para. 8, the right to fair access has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is a presumption in favor of publicaccess but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the show is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. This comports with the hallmark of openness in our judicial system. 2) The applicant seeks an order under s. 7 of McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 175 and Leader-Post v. Neuls (Q.B.). The presumption is in favour, favour, public access but that must be responsible for the establishment of a justice system that is free, fair and responsible for ensuring that all abuse and harm is not occurs to victims of natural or human trafficking. 3) The court of Queen’s Bench was the appropriate venue for the application as it was the venue of the sentencing hearing and would be able to hear the entire course of the conversation.  4) The respondent was granted regular business hours on his own premises and own leisure and was entitled to access."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act (CFSA). The Ministry’s position that the petitioner remained a child in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either of the parties. With their current living circumstances, as well as the substance abuse and behavioural issues in both parents’ lives, the Court was satisfied that neither of them were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for C.T. to his needs. The Court also found that this failure was likely to cause physical and emotional harm to the child."

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The plaintiffs claim their damages are set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. The defendant denies his workmanship was poor. He states he performed portion of the work but was not allowed to finish the job. The plaintiff alleges he suffered burn marks on the carpet, his tools remained at the plaintiffs' property for several months after the damage was done and he is entitled to judgment against the plaintiffs in the amount of $6,292.54 for the plaintiff's unpaid work. 1) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment for $3,822.00 for the necessary repairs and $100 for the cleaner. The counterclaim against the defendant is reduced by 10% or $294.54. 2) In this case, the defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed. This case was confined to exceptional cases where the defendant’s conduct was so malicious and oppressive as to warrant punishing or deterring the plaintiff. The doctrine of betterment precludes the plaintiffs from being fully compensated for a new countertop of greater value than the one which would have depreciated over time as the result of wear and tear. The incorrect width of drywall was used to expose wiring previously hidden. Much of this work had to be redone or repaired."
5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. The accused alleges that the Crown breached its agreement to allow the indictment to be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, who was re-elected to be tried by judge and jury. The Crown then applied to quash what was essentially the same count in the Court of Queen's Bench as well as to order the Crown to provide particulars to the accused. The applicant argued that this application raised a question substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. but the Crown chose not to appeal those findings. HELD: 1) The Crown was not bound in this proceeding by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in Schafer. 2) In some cases the Crown conceded that in relation to some of the matters which may appear to make findings favourable to the Leibel, but it was unable to determine from the indictment which of the original allegations the Crown was still pursuing against him in light of the Schafer judgment or whether it had now abandoned any of those matters.  3) The Court was satisfied that the application raised substantively the same question as that which it considered and determined adversely to the applicant first by trial judge Goldstein, then by judge Plemel and in the appeal of that decision."
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada. [2] The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. Given their testimony, the application of the principles of W.(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] SCR 742) is a major element of this case. More detailed analysis of their evidence is required."

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

No likelihood has been established that the appellant will provide any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of any other party which would be relevant or material to the issues raised by to the Charter motions. The testimony and documentation presented since the subpoena was quashing raise issues which warrant compelling the respondent's attendance. 2)The affidavit evidence which the respondent gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues that warrant a search of the applicant's computer for evidence concerning his activities. 3)Nothing which has happened since the defendant's application has supported those beliefs. There has not been any suggestion that the OSB, under the Superintendent, did not pursue investigations into other persons involved in the bankruptcy of the bankrupt corporation; there is no basis to find that the respondent is likely to provide any additional information concerning that issue. 4)The RCMP officers involved have testified that they were not influenced by the Redling or anyone else in the RCMP in the course of their investigation of the activities of Mr. Black. The reasons which provided when giving evidence that they did not influence the appellant's affairs, and explained the basis upon which they determined that he was unlikely to be able to provide relevant or Material evidence concerning those issues, do not provide any basis to compel his attendance.  5)The applicant did not meet the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that he has relevant and material evidence to give concerning the issues at issue. The testified and documentation at the hearings raised questions which warrant an inquiry into his conduct.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the hearing hearing officer is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Hearing Officer for a re- rehearing. The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. The tenant's application for possession was not formally before the landlord at the same time as the landlord's application. While the tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced the tenants to incur personal expense to address this problem. There is nothing in the Act which provides for the appointment of a Hearing Officer with discretionary authority. The language of the provision is broad and unconstrained which suggests an intention to confer upon hearing officers expansive discretionary authority exercisable having regard to the objects and purposes of the Act and the facts presented in evidence. To that extent, scheduling appears to be a purely administrative function."

A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","HELD: The Court found that both the accused and the complainant were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions. The Court accepted that both victims described only couple of incidents when this occurred. However, the test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The victims have no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions. There was no evidence this happened frequently.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the mortgage draws by one of the two mortgage brokers, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws in a particular manner. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff sought postponements of two irrevocable letters of direction in order to permit sufficient funds to be paid in due course. The first mortgageee, the lawyer retained by the plaintiff, had disbursed funds contrary to the first letter of direction but that he was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the second letter and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement. In the alternative, the plaintiff alleged negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Both issues were raised in the plaintiff's claim together. Damages were awarded to the plaintiff."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 718.2 of the Code are summarized in this sentence: a global sentence of 15 years to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.  2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. He displayed no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. The accused was sentenced to 11 years less credit for remand time than he received for his previous convictions and a sentence of 4 years to 12 years for the firearm related offence.  3) Although the Crown provided the Court with three cases, the Crown was primarily relying upon three cases. The Crown presented the accused with six victim impact statements, all of which dealt with the same aggravating factors: the accused's extensive criminal record, his failure to learn how to use a firearm, his inability to defend himself and his utterances about white men being rapists and pedophiles; the fact that he had allowed the accused to live in his home with him for the past four years and that the accused was not aboriginal; there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have considered in deciding the appropriate sentence for the offence of manslaughter, but the Court concluded that a 15 year sentence was appropriate, given all the factors, especially in view of the factors identified in the Gladue Report prepared by the Crown."

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","HELD: The application was based primarily on the respondent's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. There was no dispute on the facts that just over 22 months had passed between the scheduled preliminary hearing date of May 1998 and the scheduled trial date of February 2000. The Crown conceded that the delay had been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.  1) The length of delay was 8.5 months. 2) The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June. 3) The delay was sufficient to warrant a stay of the preliminary hearing. 4) The trial date was determined to be February 28, 2000. 5) In the circumstances the judge found that the Crown had not made sufficient disclosure and that the respondent had actively pursued a speedy trial."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada).

It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. There is an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania. 2) On the basis of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and the fact that he has no real property and has identified no significant activities that connect him to the jurisdiction are fact. 3) While there is a risk of non-appearance in extradition proceedings, the Court finds that it would be non-sensical for the respondent to flee before the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania, neither are they great. The respondent's application before the Court of Appeal is also dismissed. 4) In the context of review by the Minister under s. 679 of the Criminal Code, this means that the Court will not delve into the validity of the proceedings against the respondent and instead find that the respondent has met that onus on him. 5) In light of the conclusion that the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous, it is in the Court's favour that the appellant be released."

Both parties were ordered to have no contact with the other and the respondent was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. HELD: The application was dismissed.  The court was not prepared to vary the order of May 27 and the extended order of October 19 which prevented the husband from approaching the home quarter.

HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis.

The proposed third party applies to join the First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it — if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third party proceeding would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by plaintiff in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's Claim. HELD: The application for an order granting the applicant leave to file aThird party notice in the within action was granted. Application to be granted against the applicant and the third party were granted. The court was of the view there must be some material by which a prima facie claim is shown, the first party claim and the pleadings on file could well be sufficient for this purpose. To attain uniformity it seems reasonable on an application for leave under s7, to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits, and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant by appropriate directions rather than refusal of leave. The pleadings and proposed pleadings must be taken at face value; there is no evidentiary requirement to establish that they are correct. The third party's liability will have to be determined on a case by case basis."

The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court.

HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court accepted the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and concluded the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 1) Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment unless the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 2) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The plaintiff's griping was not exactly unusual in a work place and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function. 4) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions were fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one."

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.

The second part of the test was whether the Crown had proved that the accused had'reduced' his speed by any significant degree of force. The officer's evidence that he thought the accused was going too fast was not supported by the accused's own recollection of how fast the vehicle was. The Court found that the officer had no reason to believe that the vehicle moved too short a distance before striking the accused. The action was found to be careless driving, as it could not reasonably have been anticipated that a person of that speed would have been so close in front of him."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. When the provisions of the policy provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings, the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to the respondent's argument that it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by the defendant was 'off target'. 2)In any event, where a claim alleges facts which, if proven, would fall within the coverage of a policy the insurer has a duty to defend regardless of the truth or falsity of such allegations. The fact that the question is arguable should not be conclusive. 3)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) application could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1). However, the court was required to embark on an extensive review."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The complainant consented to the interception of the private communications and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police. The accused argued that the evidence of the conversation was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if the offence was a serious one and was inadvertent, the breach did not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2). The accused's application to exclude the evidence was dismissed. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the judge to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The judge did have sufficient evidence before him to issue it. 2)The breach was not serious or inadvertent and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. 3)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there were case law violations and determined that the breach was non-conscriptive. 4)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization for intercept of private communications contained the following provision: 4.The participant telephone intercept conducted without judicial authorization was found to be in contravention of s.271(1) and 273.1(2)(c) of the Code. It is reasonable to presume that information related to the offence would be obtain through an interception sought when the complainant engaged the male in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. The evidence obtained should be excluded. 5)After analyzing the provisions in R. v. Wijesinha and therelevant case authorities, the Court concluded that there is no Charter breach and that theevidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded pursuant to S.24(1). 6)The information obtained as a result of the intercepted private communications may be traced back to the time the authorization was obtained. 7)The accused had sufficient evidence to admit the evidence."

The issues before the court is interim custody and primary residence of the child, access by the other parent and interim child maintenance. The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance.

e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The defence sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)Annette Cook's prior statement was improperly obtained in breach of the oath rules of voluntariness and 2)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement and there was no warning provided at that time of her arrest of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. It was a business decision made by accused persons who are asked to cooperate. There may be situations in which the trial judge concludes that an appropriate substitute for an oath is established and that notwithstanding the absence of an oath the statement is reliable. However, in this case the Court was satisfied that the reliability threshold is not met, even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of that statement is false. The form of demeanour evidence is video tape. It is not possible to substitute an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The present evidence does not support the allegation that the witness has been induced to lie. 2)There was insufficient solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit, to bring home to her the truth, that the oath she was taking would have the same effect as if she was testifying in court before a judge. The Court was not prepared to say that portions of this statement which did not implicate the accused person but rather attempts to exonerate someone were unreliable."

b_2014skqb81.txt,"Limitation of Actions – Mortgage – Saskatchewan Farmland SecurityHELD: When s. 12 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act was enacted it was the legislature’s intention that a mortgagee, to whom The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act applied, could suspend the limitation period clock from running and after serving a notice of intention to enforce its security, provided that within three years of such service the mortgagee made application to the court for an order under s. 11 permitting it to commence an enforcement action. If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again. The notice of extension in this case expired in 2009 and the limitation clock began to run again. The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired. The respondent’s mortgage was registered at the Land Titles Office. This registration continues to date as Interest Registration No. 106597705. The reason the respondent served notice of intention to foreclose upon the applicant was that s. 12 of the Farm Security Act had suspended the running of the limitation time. The applicant had obtained a perpetual right to commence enforcement proceedings without regard to any limitation periods.  The court found that the wording of s. 22 of the Act was not intended to stop the application, but rather to ensure that mortgagees would have available to them the full limitation period they would otherwise have had but for the infringement on that time by the requirements of the Limitations Act."

9_2014skqb386.txt,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction. Corrigendum received dated March 6, 2015 and added to fulltext. HELD: The appeal was granted.  1) Given that the presumption of care and control was rebutted, the trial judge next considered whether the accused had 'de facto control' as defined by Boudreault (2012 SKPC 129), [2012] SCR 157, and found that he did. 2) The trial judge found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the appellant did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as rebutting the statutory presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings."
d_2001nsca44.txt,"The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing death, causing death in the operation of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol, criminal negligence causing bodily harm, and causing bodily harm while under the influence of alcohol. The appellant advanced several grounds of appeal, including that her s. 10 Charter rights had been infringed because she had not been informed of the extent of her jeopardy, namely that there had been serious injuries and perhaps a fatality, before having to respond to a breathalyser demand. She claimed that this should have resulted in a stay of all charges. She also alleged that lost evidence resulted in a breach of her s. 7 Charter right to make full answer and defence. Dismissing the appeal, that assuming without deciding that the appellant's s. 10 Charter right was breached, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach which was heard by the jury. Further, the evidence which was lost was not an issue in the trial.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.",HELD: The appeals were dismissed. The court found that the respondent had no standing to bring his application pursuant to s. 222(d) of the Act and that the Chambers judge made errors in his approach to the application.
c_2005skqb166.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was convicted of impaired driving. An initial question is whether the trial judge's decision reflected a conviction on both counts or a conviction only for the impaired driving charge. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside with an order that a new trial be held. 1) The court found a conviction was not entered on the .08 charge and the judicial stay was not used by the trial judge to avoid a multiplicity of convictions. 2) There was an error in law in that the trial judge relied at least in part on the certificate readings for his conclusion of impairment. What the verdict would have been, absent the trial judge's consideration of the certificate, is not clear. The matter must be resolved in favour of the accused. As the court was of the opinion that the remaining admissible evidence could have resulted in a like verdict, a new trial is ordered.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by alcohol under ss.255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and, secondly, with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The trial judge concluded that the impaired driving charge was stronger than the.08 charge and convicted the accused of impaired driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. In this case, the trial judge determined that the accused was guilty of both counts and that the impairment charge was the stronger one. The decision was set aside and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge did not commit an error in law. He was only bound by the observations of an off-duty RCMP constable. 2)The evidence of impairment was sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that alcohol consumption was contributing factor to the alleged signs of impairment. The Court noted in its decision to set aside the conviction and set aside a conditional stay on the driving charge.  3)The accused's notice of appeal was updated and added an appeal against the conviction."
4_1996canlii6841.txt,"The respondent conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax. Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. The primary function of the documentation was ongoing technical support for the valves operation, maintenance and modifications. The valves and documentation were identified as separate items on the same purchase order and arrived at the job site separately. The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f). The parties agreed the documents fell within the definition of tangible property as set out in the Act. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. Costs were awarded to the appellant. 1)The role of the Court was in the nature of judicial review and supervisory in nature. The Court's role on questions of fact is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not support findings of fact. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts.  3)The determination of whether the documents were required for preparing the property for use in Saskatchewan is a question of fact. There was nothing technical about the statutory requirement. The words used are simple and ordinary. It was open to the Board to determine as a finding of fact that the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use. 4)Technical papers by their nature are often going to a narrow audience. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.","Husky Oil appealed a decision of the Revenue and Financial Services Board which upheld the assessment of sales tax. The respondent, under the provisions of the Education and Health Tax Act and the Department of Revenue and Finance Act, conducted an audit resulting in the assessment in the amount of $37,842.07. The appellant argued the board erred in its conclusion that the purchase of the documentation was not required for preparing the valves for use in Saskatchewan and there was evidence before the Board upon which it was open to them to come to that conclusion. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision reversed. Husky Oil was awarded its costs of the appeal. 1)On questions of fact the Court's role is restricted to circumstances where the evidence does not warrant findings of fact made by the Board. The alternative does not focus upon the extent to which the book or technical paper is produced, distributed or made available to a sufficiently broad audience but rather the purpose for which the document may be produced and distributed and is therefore not entitled to claim an exemption under s. 8(1)(f) of the Act. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)The application of the statutory requirements in this instance was based largely upon the Interpretation of the word 'published'. The board correctly identified the issue as one of whether or not the drawings were required for preparation of the property as required by s. 5(12). The respondent appealed. 3)On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which is not warranting that finding. 4)Each province with a sales tax exemption has its own set of statutory requirements. In this case the board determined as finding of fact that the documents were not required to prepare the valves at the appellant's BPU site in Saskatchewan. It is the Board's finding that the Appellant fails to meet the requirements of s.8(1)of the Act and therefore is not entitled, on an appeal of this nature, to claim such an exemption. 5)The Court was of no consequence but might say find no difficulty in accepting the board's conclusion on this important factual determination. Questions of law are within the purview of the Court. On a review of a board's decision the Court is bound to consider the evidence before it, whether it is determined by the board that the order of the documents was independent of the document, and accordingly fall within the definition of 'books'."
2011skca19.txt,"The accused, a member of the RCMP, was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(1)(a). The accused successfully appealed his conviction to the Court of Queen's Bench where a new trial was ordered. The Queen's Bench Judge held that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent on the whether the accused reasonably believed that he was about to be grievously harmed and that the trial judge erred by not considering the evidence of the other police officer who testified at the trial. The Crown appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the summary conviction appeal judge misinterpreted the trial judge's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction restored. The summary conviction appeal court judge erred in finding that the trial judge's reasons were inconsistent. The trial judge engaged in classical alternative reasoning. While the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence, he did not err in failing to do so. The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The Crown appealed the conviction of the officer who assaulted the complainant. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the officer was mistaken in his belief that he was in imminent danger of death and that his action was necessary in self-defence to be reasonable. The officer did not direct himself to all of the relevant evidence, which resulted in a reviewable error. The judge focused on the fact there were two officers present. He did not address the complainant's statement that the finger incident occurred twice, which formed the basis for him to find that the instruction to leave the yard also occurred twice. The issue was whether the officer had been operating under a reasonable mistake of fact; whether the force used was necessary to defend himself against a perceived threat; and whether the proportionality of his response."
e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","The City appealed a decision of the Human Rights Tribunal sitting as a tribunal under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent, a cerebral palsy patient. The respondent claimed that the City had discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The tribunal found that the respondent had made his complaint within the Code's limitation period and that, because of this disability, he was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The tribunal failed to take into account the respondent's disability or the fact that he was a casual employee in the City. It was impossible for the respondent to gain employment with the City because the entry-level position was something he could not do because of his disabilities. The requirement of building up seniority as a driver presented an insurmountable barrier for the petitioner because of the entry level position and he received 4% less in wages than other comparable City employees. The wage differential was inappropriate and the respondent was compensated in the amount of $8,902.00. 2)The respondent's numerous attempts to gain permanent status over the years were unsuccessful. His frustration with the city and CUPE heightened once he became aware of other casual employees, hired after him, who passed the respondent on the seniority list and then assigned him as permanent employee to drive tandem truck. The decision was based on an informal arrangement whereby casual employees were given priority over permanent employees in bidding for any permanent position, amongst those who were qualified. The City was able to accommodate the respondent by allowing him to move between truck driving duties. The appellant's casual employment hours always entitled him to collect Employment Insurance in the winter."

It was clear that the accused was confused and not focused on the present and that his mind had wandered off to the need to acquire counsel to represent him at trial as opposed to his immediate right to have counsel. His muttered reply created enough uncertainty that the officer should have made an effort to clarify the informational component of the right to counsel.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault, use or threatened use of weapon and failure to comply with his recognizance of August 2, 2008 related to alcohol and weapon possession. The accused was given his Charter rights and was advised of his right to contact counsel without delay and on the more serious charges as he became almost immediately the suspect in the assault on the same street person as they were known to be heavy drinkers who shared the porch. After being detained, the accused returned to the porch, found the victim lying on the pew and assaulted him with a piece of iron rebar sending the victim to the hospital with a head injury. The police and the accused, who was under the disability of severe addiction, were aware that he did not intend to be cooperative witness and were required to clear up any misunderstanding he may have may have exhibited about his rights. The video of the accused making this statement can be viewed here. It would be egregious to allow admission of the videotaped statement into evidence. The defence submits that the accused exhibited a fundamental misunderstanding of his basic constitutional rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. They were aware he had not been fully informed of his rights at the time he made the statement, and they were not required to provide further explanation of the rights. There is a low threshold with respect to the degree of drunkenness, voluntariness and see no evidence of oppression, threats or promises at this juncture. The Court reviewed the video and found that this was an absolute fundamental right to get advice from counsel before making a statement to the police. Access to counsel is the gateway of Charter rights particularly in these circumstances where this statement is the only evidence to be offered by the Crown in seeking conviction. The Crown suggests that the Charter breach does not reach the threshold of exclusion, pointing out that the police officers did not act in bad faith. This was a different situation than those cases involving guns and narcotics. The trial judge found that it would be unconscionable for the police to fail to take into account the accused's sobering recollection of what happened that day and the fact that he was unable to fully understand the Charter due to his severe intoxication."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. The judgment centered on a clause governing retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. The appellant had argued that the phrase 'any employer' referred to the employer for whom the employee was working at the time of the agreement and thus was entitled to retroactive wages from every employer for which he had worked during the period. The arbitrator found the phrase to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded in his ratio of 1:1 that this was an unambiguous interpretation. This is an incorrect proposition of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed orally.  1)The competing aids to interpretation did not find the phrase unambiguous one. The phrase referred to any employer in the context of the collective agreement, which was minimal and, in my view, not persuasive. 2)The arbitrator was unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history. 3)The grievance was dismissed."

The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. Leave was granted nunc pro tunc to bring third party proceedings. (1)The third party claim disclosed a reasonable cause of action. It was not plain and obvious the claim could not succeed. It was arguable on the pleadings that the third parties did not act in good faith in that it was alleged they deliberately set out to suppress information and destroy evidence. (2)The statutory limitations will not nullify the third party claim if the allegations relevant to the contention that the third parties did not act in good faith are proven.","The third parties applied to strike out the third party claim on the basis that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action.

After the husband's retirement, the wife sought to receive her share of the pension from the employer as a lump sum. The husband objected, claiming that he was entitled to any remaining benefit from her share in the event she should predecease him. The wife applied for directions.

Unfortunately, the appellant had a drug dependency problem and by June 1995 was hospitalized.

The appellant sought rescission of the order in question on the authority of the Family Court Rule 15:07 and 15:08.

Expert evidence was given based on blood samples taken after the accident that the accused was impaired; this opinion was based on two assumptions, namely, that the accused had not consumed alcohol within half an hour of the accident, nor after the accident. The Crown did not offer any evidence to prove these assumptions and, in fact, there was a three hour period prior to the accident where there was no evidence of what the accused, who did not testify, was doing. Acquitting the accused, that the expert evidence cannot be tendered by the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been impaired. The remainder of the evidence against the accused was insufficient to prove the accused's doubt beyond a reasonable doubt.","A 21 year old friend of the accused was charged with criminal negligence causing death after she observed a white vehicle go over the centre line of the highway by a few inches for approximately 20 seconds. The accused was later found to be the operator of the white vehicle. Viva voce evidence was heard at trial and the court reserved decision for January 19/2001. HELD: The Court held that the proof of impairment consists of observations of conduct in most cases and where the conduct is a slight departure from normal activity, it would be unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs.  1)The accused was found to have been the driver of the vehicle for approximately 3 hours prior to the accident. The blood alcohol content of the victim was determined to be between 180 to 220 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and the blood serum was analyzed rather than whole blood. 2)Although the accused's condition may have affected her ability to operate the motor vehicle, the initial reading of her blood alcohol level at 12:10 p.m. was accurate and her blood pressure was reduced accordingly.  3)The evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with reasonable doubt.

3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","The only witnesses called at trial were the plaintiff and the defendant. The issue was whether the defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.  1)There was no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and/or the defendant, Hyndman, having been noted for default. 2)The plaintiff had not proven its claim with respect to the unpaid repairs.  3)The actions taken by both the parties were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. As it turned out, neither Redhead nor the plaintiff benefited from this arrangement for very long and both lost money.  4)The facts did not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this was an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  5)Costs. Although there was no specific contract regarding the repair of the leased vehicles, it was clear that the defendant did make some payments on behalf of Standard with regard to some work orders that were issued by the plaintiff. In fact the evidence indicated that the payments by the defendant were made either under the direction of Bennett or for work that was done where a specific purchase order number was supplied by Hyn. Duda's evidence did not establish that either defendant had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order numbers obtained from Hynd.

4_1999skqb3.txt,"The plaintiff was the coordinator of post-secondary education programs for White Bear First Nation, between 1990 until his termination in May 1997. The plaintiff managed post-secondary programs with an annual budget of $960,000, taught upgrading and university entrance courses, and supervised other teaching and support staff. In 1996 an education board was established and given the task of overseeing the administration of the education complex and its teaching programs. There was overlap between the plaintiff and the board's mandate and functions that led to conflict. The board suspended the plaintiff for 10 days during which time it intended to investigate the plaintiff's conduct. The suspension continued and the board later passed a resolution formally terminating the plaintiff's employment. The plaintiff sued for wrongful dismissal. The defendant contended it dismissed the plaintiff with cause. HELD: The plaintiff was wrongfully dismissed. The court ruled that the employer had to provide evidence demonstrating serious employee misconduct. There was no such evidence produced by the defendant, and it was not enough simply to show a loss of confidence in the plaintiff or dissatisfaction with his job performance. The plaintiff's damages were limited to being paid out the end of his term contract. Punitive and aggravated damages were not allowed. Although the plaintiff had been treated unfairly, the plaintiff had not shown that the employer was guilty of harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and malicious conduct.","HELD: The plaintiff was dismissed from his position as co-ordinator of post secondary education programs in May 1997. He sought damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had been employed from 1988 to 1997 as guidance counsellor for the Chief and Band Council. In 1990 he became co-director of postsecondary programs and remained in that position until terminated in 1997. In 1997 he was appointed co-president of the Board of Directors of the education complex. He now seeks damages for breach of contract and insubordination.  1) The plaintiff's employment agreement provided for an annual salary of $45,760 to be paid in twelve monthly installments. Up to the date of his termination he had received $33,366.38. He was entitled to judgment for the difference and pre-judgment interest on that amount calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act.  2) It was impossible for the plaintiff to adapt to the short-term funding environment created by the proposed method of proceeding with personnel issues within the education system. The fact that he was dismissed within weeks of his contract expiring in the normal course did not warrant summary dismissal. 3) Just cause is not altogether a term of art. In general, it refers to that degree of misconduct or incompetence which warrants stiff reprisal as opposed to some lesser sanction such as a warning, reprimand or remediation. There was evidence to support the plaintiff's claim for punitive or aggravated damages. It was clear that summary dismissal can be utilized only for serious misconduct or breaches of fundamental kind. That was not the case here.  4) Punitive damages are what the phrase implies. They are intended as an expression of denunciation of the wrongdoer's conduct and as a form of punishment where there has been no other sanction."
e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The respondent father is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments? HELD: 1) The respondent's income is determined to be $29,983. He will be in a small credit position which he can offset against ongoing maintenance but in amount no greater than $50 per month so as not to cause any inappropriate financial hardship on the children. When arrears by the payor occur, this Court often allows those payments to be paid monthly. See no reason why the overpayment by a payor should not be treated in the same fashion in these circumstances.  2) Personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses (vi) Capital cost allowance on real property owned by the partnership; and (vii) capital cost allowance have been claimed for personal use for three years. The father testified he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The mother's request to add back half of the respondent's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners was substantially different than that contained in his personal farming statement. It appears that the more appropriate amount would be $5,000. In 2003, the income of the petitioner was $24,300. In 2004, the respondent was in a smaller credit position, but he could offset against continuing maintenance but only to the extent of $50 so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518 per month until the over payment has been extinguished. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the respondent in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges that a portion of the vehicle is used as personal use. However, the mother testified that she intended to use it for further personal use whenever she could. She claimed the vehicle was used for 'personal use whenever possible'. The respondent will be able to offset against any ongoing maintenance payments but in the amount no higher than $60 per month. The capital cost allowances on real and private property are non-subsidized childcare and the health and medical costs in excess of $100 per annum are not included in the calculation of s. expense payments.

The trial judge agreed with Crown counsel that the conversation should not have been admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement. The appellant did not enter into a guilty plea nor did he enter a guilty verdict. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the new trial order, that the evidence of the Crown witnesses and the axe found in the water had been found to be a crucial factor in the conviction."

The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge. It may be that the plaintiff was indebted to the solicitor at the time of the contempt which would not excuse his failure to comply with the court order but may influence the matter of costs. It may also be that the legal costs incurred to enforce production were out of proportion to any gain the plaintiff could have expected.","FIAT. The defendant was in contempt of court orders requiring him to account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. A trustee was appointed, and the files of Bawolin were seized.

8_2013skqb397.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. It held that although it had concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court regarding habeas corpus applications, it declined jurisdiction in this case to grant a remedy because habeas corpus could not be used to review a decision of CSC made within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants were trying to use habeas corpus when they actually were seeking a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies were available only through the Federal Court.","The applicants have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution due to a threat to their respective liberties claiming the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in not allowing them to reside in a common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. HELD: 1) The applicants should have followed the grievance process as it was the established process for offenders' redress when they felt they had been treated unfairly, or in a manner that was not consistent with their Charter rights. The Court assumes neither of the applicants' situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. 2) Rather than bringing this application under the grievance under the Offender Complaint and Grievance System, both the applicants and Sinobert chose to bring it to this Court in September 2013. They have suffered three strokes since 1993 and suffers the effects from mercury poisoning (Minamata disease) and its effects, for which he has suffered with for his 62 years of life. Although institutional charges may sometimes lead to a security reclassification of an offender, Richer has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed in a separate living unit, neither having had their security levels reclassified and neither having filed a first-level grievance. Habeas corpus is a guarantee of liberty, not a channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of the prison. 3) The Court's jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Services of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. The applicants are seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the agency which do not impact their residual liberty. While the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certioraris, prohibition or mandamus, these remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process."
d_1991canlii4237.txt,"In this divorce action the petitioner sought to have a separation agreement entered into by the parties incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The respondent sought to have the separation agreement set aside on the grounds of duress, undue influence or unconscionsability. The couple had a traditional marriage. The petitioner earned $48,000 per year. The wife did not work outside the home and suffered from severe arthritis. For the petitioner and incorporating into the agreement an added provision addressing the respondent's need for drug coverage, that there was nothing unduly harsh about the agreement which would justify setting it aside. The evidence indicated that the respondent had received independent legal advice and she did not establish that she had been dominated by the petitioner to the extent that her signature would have been induced by undue influence or duress. The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","The parties entered into a separation agreement for the purpose of increasing the maintenance provision and retaining the asset division. The agreement stipulated that the husband should retain the matrimonial home with an equal division of net proceeds if it were to be sold. The husband argued that the agreement should be set aside as a result of the wife's unconscionability and harshness of the previous agreement and that she should have explored using a vehicle as a trade in. Matrimonial Home The parties in their separation agreement indicated that they assumed $60,000 as their gross domestic product at the time of separation. They also agreed that they would not make any claim against the husband's Employee Pension Benefits which they had received as part of the separation agreement. The wife's application for divorce dismissed on the basis that the parties had not entered into the agreement in such a fashion as to require a change in the terms of the contract or agreement as to its maintenance provision. Husband and wife separation agreement set aside; if the court were to find that there were any factors which had been established under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act to warrant such an amount, it would find that it was not subject to review by the court as there were no special circumstances as under the Divorce Act of Nova Scotia."

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The former wife sought to vary the child support terms of the Corollary Relief Judgment, pursuant to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The parties had an agreement that the parties would share joint custody of the children, with the husband to pay child support based on the income of the wife and the father to pay spousal support of $1,268 per month. The applicant argued that her RRSP income should not be considered when calculating child support as it is a recurring income figure over the past four years and was not an adjustment contemplated by Schedule III. The husband asked the court to review the level of child support paid back to the date of the parties separation and should retroactive award be granted. The court was not convinced that the applicant would suffer undue hardship by having her share of the support offset against the father's payment."

The judge at preliminary inquiry concluded that there was evidence adduced that the accused had paid money to the man who had killed the victim the day after the killing, that she was involved in cleaning the apartment where the killing took place after the body was removed, and that the accused and the man who killed the victim had discussed the matter prior to the event, and thus there was sufficient evidence upon which a 'properly instructed jury may find...[the accused] guilty...' The appellant contended that the judge had applied the wrong test for committal.

2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The accused raised a Charter defence arguing that section 35 of The Fisheries Act was unconstitutional. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. A conservation officer had attempted to serve the accused with a copy of letter signed by an unknown person on behalf of the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch. The letter purported to advise the accused that due to a previous conviction his current fishing license was revoked and he was prohibited from obtaining another one. The letter referenced a prohibition under s. 13(4) of The Fisheries Regulations. The conversation officer testified that he opened the door of a house that he thought belonged to the accused and left the letter on a stand near the door. The conservation officer was unable to say if the occupant heard him say anything about a license suspension or whether anyone in the house saw him place the envelope on the stand inside the door. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","HELD: The Charter application was dismissed. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s. 27 of The Fisheries Act. The Court found that s. 35 of the Act is unconstitutional in that it creates a reverse onus, infringing the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and is not saved by s. of the Charter. The Crown had conceded that the accused had a fishing licence, valid on its face, and had acted in compliance with it. The issue was whether the Minister had the authority under s. 23.1 of The Interpretation Act to prohibit the accused from applying for or obtaining a licence. The fishing licence was issued in June 2009, issued in September 2008, and in September 2009, it was revoked by the Fisheries Board. In September of 2009, the accused went on a fishing trip to Waterbury Lake, along with his sister, Nicole, and their three small children. The accused was observed 'actively angling' numerous times between September 20 and September 25. The search warrant was executed over the course of about 2 hours. He was stopped by conservation officers who were in possession of a search warrant. The three little boys, Nicole and the accused were redirected to the Sask. Environment maintenance compound. The RCMP executed search warrant and seized numerous other items, including a stainless steel cooler with the accused's name and address scratched into it, a blue cooler and plastic food cooler, all of which contained 20 fish (assuming their licences were valid at the relevant times) and a letter signed by an unknown person purporting to revoke, revoke, or prohibit the applicant from applying to or obtaining an angling licence. This was not a collateral attack on a ministerial order, valid or having been made without authority, and the prohibition was not invalid."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally. The high threshold for a finding that it disentitles the daughters to maintenance has not been met.","The mother applied to vary the 1992 maintenance for her daughters, Nicole and Kirsti. She also applied for determination that the father was in arrears of maintenance and that he provide to her years of retroactive child support. The trial judge found that although the mother's efforts to contact the daughter were no greater than those of the daughter's, she was still entitled to maintenance. The father discontinued child support in September 2006. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a relationship with the father and that there was no order for retroactive maintenance. As the mother had not rebutted the father's contention that she had always been entitled to child support, the court held that it would not be just and equitable to require the father to pay the $26,730.54 per month. The fact that the daughter had recently graduated from high school and was employed by the father did not change the fact that she was no longer entitled to support."
d_2018skpc6.txt,"HELD: On the basis of the evidence presented by the parties’ experts and in absence of an express term in the contract, the court read in an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price and awarded the plaintiff such portion of the amount sought as was fair and reasonable. The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide 'call out' services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and related equipment. Super Save paid Reliable's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: The plaintiff received some but not nearly all of the money that it was seeking. The defendant was successful in reducing the amount of money that was sought but not entirely. The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price. 1)The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $1,550.85 which was to be paid immediately.  2)Reliable was awarded costs of travel, shop supplies, and services. It is clear from the invoice that prior to November of 2015 the defendant did not take issue with the plaintiff's non-existent charge for services. There was no evidence led as to precisely when the contract commenced or how much time elapsed. Nor was it satisfied that the plaintiff was paying too much. It was unable to determine how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred.  3)Costs of travel were to be determined by the plaintiff. Costs of shop supplies at a rate of $.42 for a round trip distance of 500 km were awarded. 4)The amount of travel was not shown on the evidence but was based on an implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge a reasonable price for the goods and services that were provided. It could not be concluded how many trips, if any, the plaintiff had been required to attend on a call out basis.  5)In businesses such as the plaintiff’s, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged for the services. The plaintiffs incurred additional time and arguably higher retail cost to acquire certain parts. The amount sought was unreasonable.  6)The defendant properly submitted two statements of account from its expert. The first, for his initial attendance, equates to $250. The second, $350."

6_2010skqb51.txt,"The Bankrupt applies for his discharge from bankruptcy. The discharge is opposed by the Credit Union and the trustee. The Bankrupt was a cattle farmer. He financed this undertaking principally through the Credit Union. HELD: The Bankrupt will be discharged conditional upon payment of $8,000 in addition to surplus income of $2,250 to his estate for the benefit of his creditors. He should be able to comply with this order within 3 years.  1) The bankrupt is 42 years old and a first time bankrupt. He is employed with an excavating company and earns $20 an hour and works as much as 160 hours per week. He is paying $1,000 per month on his mortgage and is trying to catch up on mortgage arrears to stave off foreclosure. He is working hard and living a subsistence life. However, he still has some funds left with an income level above the Superintendent's Standard for a family of two. 2) His assets are less than $.50 on the dollar. His creditors were put to the unnecessary expense by his frivolous or vexatious defence of their claim and he failed to comply with the duties of a bankrupt by failing to produce proper records and assist the trustee to the fullest. He has been abusive and disrespectful throughout.","The bankrupt applied for his discharge from bankruptcy. His statement of affairs showed assets of $171,255 (mostly exempt or encumbered) against unsecured debts totalling $433,750 and secured debt of $150,000. The bankruptcy judge adjourned the application sine die and fiat issued requiring further disclosure. The bankrupt asserted a security interest over the equity pursuant to s173(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He argued that the drought, which had occurred five or six years prior to his assignment, had resulted in his inability to grow sufficient feed for his cattle operation and he was forced to purchase cattle feed at great expense. He also claimed that he sold cattle in the year prior to bankruptcy because it simply amounted to a sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business. SCU cross-examined the bankrupt and found him to be evasive, uncooperative and un-attentive to his duties under the BIA and at times verbally abusive. HELD: The bankrupt was granted an absolute discharge by virtue of s172(2) and the appropriate terms of his discharge were set out. 1)The bankrupt was 42 years old. He had one son from a previous relationship who did not reside with him. He was employed with an excavating company earning $20/hr but could only buy cattle at night. His farm and personal accounts were in state of total disarray. He should be able to comply with the conditional order within three years, which is considered an acceptable period of time for a bankrupt to be burdened with a conditional order. The court found that the bankrupt's pattern of breeding and raising cattle with view to selling the calves in the same year constituted the normal course of his farming operation and it made little sense to fault him for selling inventory in that course when it's part of the business operation itself and done for purposes of earning livelihood in a recognized, routine way. 2)In circumstances of significant asset depletion without corresponding satisfactory explanation, the bankrupt failed to meet the onus on him. His failure to produce proper records and to assist the trustee to the fullest was found to have been established. The onus is on the objecting creditor to prove the existence of s173 (2)of the Act if it is not otherwise reported by the trustee. The Court awarded costs of the trial at not less than $300 per month and an absolute order of discharge in the amount of $50,000 which represents half of the judgment."
e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the chambers judge erred in failing to address the question of whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines. The only issue on appeal was the order that the appellant pay 73% of the children's extracurricular activities, which, of course, came to $30,384 per year, which the respondent received tax free. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him."
c_2002skqb508.txt,"A motion for judicial review of a Labour Relations Board decision awarding a retroactive wage increase to employees. The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties. To set aside the entire process because the retroactivity issue was not front and centre in the preliminary discussions would seem contrary to reason and curial deference. Had the raise in pay not been retroactive it would, in light of the late decision, been rather meaningless.","This is a motion for judicial review of the decision of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board (""the Board""). The Board awarded a wage increase to employees of Four Star Management Ltd., operators of certain food services at the University of Saskatchewan. The wage increase was part of first collective bargaining agreement concluded by the Board after the normal bargaining between the parties had failed. The employer had advised the Board that it was not prepared to make the agreement retroactive. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The Board's decision to favour the union and make the wage increases fully retroactive was patently unreasonable. It would be unsound to base entitlement to retroactive benefits on the serendipitous signing of a collective agreement or the signing of Board decision imposing one."

At issue on appeal was whether the accused should have received a life SOIRA compliance order or a 20-year SOIRA order. HELD: The appeal was allowed.

His order must be set aside and replaced with a lifetime SOIra compliance order.[1] The plain meaning of the section is that there is no need to resort to other principles of statutory interpretation; however, if it were necessary to do so, the plain meaning interpretation of s.(2) 490.013(2.1) as not applying in circumstances where sentence is concomitantly pronounced for multiple 'designated offence' convictions and the offender's criminal record discloses no prior convictions for a 'designation offence' such as this one."

HELD: 1) The sentencing judge was aware that the appellants had been previously convicted in 1990 of transporting wildlife without the prescribed documents. The sentencing judge determined that the fines must be sufficient to deter the appellants and the general public. The sentencing judge was also aware that the appellants are leaders in the elk industry. This is a factor that would require a sufficient fine to set an example for others in the industry and within the appellants' community.  2) In this case of fifteen convictions, the maximum fines prescribed are $750,000. The total fine of $69,000 for placing elk in danger and for obstructing inspectors cannot be considered disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the court could not find the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit'. Oppositely, it is both appropriate and fit. 3) Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.","The appellants were convicted by a provincial court judge of several offences pursuant to the Health of Animals Act and the Health Of Animals Regulations resulting from their handling of elk and from obstructing inspectors. The total sentence imposed by the trial judge was a fine of $69,000. The appellants appealed the sentence on the basis that the fines were too harsh and exceeded the overall capability of the offender to pay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not demonstrably unfit. Other than varying the default provisions to the statutory default times outlined in s. 734(8) of the Criminal Code, this appeal is dismissed.  1) The fines were not excessive. They were within the range of what is required under the CWD Act. 2) The sentencing judge erred in law in imposing fines without regard to the offenders' ability to pay, which is not an error of law justifying interference by appellate courts.  3) The sentences were disproportionately high. Given the need for the sentencing judge to address deterrence in a public welfare statute, the sentence was 'demonstrably unfit.' Oppositely, it was both appropriate and fit.  Opposite of the usual negative connotation of achieving compliance by threat of punishment, there was also a factor of factality to the sentence, namely, the fact that the offences were committed within the context of the common law."
b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) of the Regulations. 3) Counsel for the appellant was entitled to solicitor-client costs as provided by s. 198(5) of the Act and Regulation 101.","The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree that the appellant is defined by the Act as a non-earner who was involved in a motor vehicle accident in July 1998 and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as skidder operator. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs. 1) The Act provides for calculation of IRB for the first 180 days and for the 181st and subsequent days. 2) The legislation strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average approach'. 3) The earning reality of the appellant was working for employment income no more than half the time. He would have worked, on average, 90 of the 180 days. The reduction in the period of employment be reduced to factor in inclement weather is not required. There is no requirement to include employment insurance benefits in the calculation required for s. 24(1) Of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations, s. 114 and s.115 require that the income replacement benefits be calculated based solely on the time that the victim would have actually been employed. This position is based on employment promised to the appellant in 1998. The appellant will receive $50,000 per year as replacement for lost wages. SGI submits that the weighted average approach in calculating the IRB set the appellant's gross yearly employment income (GYEI) much lower. The ratio in Dietner is not relevant. The provisions of s. 117 and the corresponding regulations provide the mathematical formula to determine Montgrand's IRB and the GYEI from which it is derived."
6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The issue for the Court was whether Tristen was a child of the marriage as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The parties married in 2001 and separated in 2008. The parenting and support issues concerning the biological child have been resolved. The respondent has a child, who is the biological son of the petitioner. The petitioner asserts that the respondent does not'stand in the place of a parent' when this decision was made. HELD: The Court held that the threshold for parental status finding is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in a substantial substitution for that of a natural parent. The Court found that this case was different because the respondent lived in a very short marriage, and although the respondent's parents had a relationship, they did not have a relationship with the child as long as the child was with the respondent. This is an appropriate case for an award of child support in the amount of $26,000."
4_2010skqb193.txt,"The litigation revolved around a claim by the plaintiffs for damages that resulted from a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff alleged damages from injuries in a statement of claim issued in 2006. In 2010, the defendant insurance companies made a demand for particulars seeking production of documents listed in the plaintiff's Statement as to Documents, most of which related to determining the extent of the plaintiffs injury. Counsel for the plaintiff opposed the application and suggested the issues were for discovery. HELD: The purpose of Queen's Bench Rule 139 is to provide the defendant with sufficient particulars to comprehend the nature and extent of the plaintiff's claim and respond with an intelligible statement of defence. Rule 164 allows a defendant to make a demand for particulars and disclosure of documents to assess the merits of the case, assess the merits of settlement and to prepare for examination for discovery. In this case, the defendants are entitled to know the current medical condition of the plaintiff prior to discovery because they might need further medical examinations, medical opinions and the assistance of an accident reconstructionist or mechanic to prepare to represent their client at the discovery. The plaintiff was granted 40 days from the date of the order to reply to the demand for particulars.","FIAT: The plaintiffs were operating a tractor unit bearing Manitoba licence plates and pulling a semi-trailer bearing an Alberta licence plate. On the 22nd day of August 2004, the plaintiffs were involved in a head on collision on a stretch of highway in the Province of Saskatchewan. The plaintiff sustained right leg injury, lacerations, back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The defendant auto insurers of each of the three provinces are named defendants. Saskatchewan, at all material times, was governed by a no-fault insurance regime. The plaintiffs claimed DDH had not recovered from her injuries and damages were accruing but the extent thereof was not yet known. The defendants, after delivery of the initial pleadings of the opponent, sought better particulars and disclosure of documents. HELD: The defendants' application was granted. Each of the defendants furnished a draft order. Each defendant's application was to issue as an order of the court, save and except for the request for costs in the cause. It would be premature to award costs. The trial judge will be able to see the reply to demands for particulars and be better positioned to assess the merits of these motions than I was able to infer from the material presently before the court."
5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the respondent pay ongoing support for his granddaughter of $293 per month. The parties had been unable to reach an agreement regarding child support and had proceeded to trial. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the child support order should be made retroactive; 2) if so, retroactive. The s. 7(1)(c) of The Family Maintenance Act provides that the court must look at the child's best interests and her needs in order to meet her ongoing support obligations. The child care expenses incurred in this case do not meet these requirements. The jurisprudence however is clear that retroactive support should not be given as a matter of course. There must be some justification for such orders. There was no blameworthy conduct on the part of the respondent."
e_2003skqb69.txt,"FIAT. The receiver manager of the registered owner (the numbered company) under the Bankruptcy Act and the instrument appointed receiver on behalf of the secured creditor and mortgagee (HSBC Bank) applied for a vesting order. The trustee had tried to sell the real property for year. HELD: The vesting order was granted. 1)Although the Court tentatively concluded that s.109 of the new Land Tittles Act, 2000 combined with Queen's Bench Act ss.12 and 65 are not sufficient authority to support the granting of a vesting order in the circumstances, the Court was now satisfied that Regulation 6.5 of the Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulation to the new Act does so. In substance the regulation parallels the nature, extent, purpose and intent served by the vesting order provisions contained in the former s.87. 2)This was an appropriate case to grant a vesting order in the absence of adverse interests or any interest in the registered owner or any subsequent encumbrancer or other creditor. The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT. The Receiver for theRegistered Owner applied for a vesting order under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to register title in favour of the proposed purchaser of the real property. Neither HSBC nor the applicant trustee proceeded with foreclosure proceedings against the property in question. The Court reviewed the relevant decision reviewing the Clarkson case and found that the jurisdiction formerly granted to the Court by s. 87 of the Land Titles Act, 1978 was not brought forward by the new Land Titling Facilitation Regulations (LTCR) or in particular Regulation 6.5 dealing with vesting orders. HELD: The application was granted. The form of the draft order filed with the applicant solicitor's subsequent submissions was issueable.  1)The jurisdiction of the Court was determined appropriately based upon the conclusions reached by the Court of Appeal in the trial of the former registered owner. The reservations did not exist or apply to the circumstances respecting the application presently before the Court.  2)The Court raised with counsel for the applicant the court's jurisdiction to issue the vesting ordered applied for in these circumstances. Neither the Bank nor the Trustee, a secured creditor and mortgagee of certain real property of the registered owner applied for this order. The onus is on the applicant to prove to the court that all such parties have been served. 3)If the order for sale is approved, the applicant might then or on a later occasion apply for another application to have the sale approved by the court. The material satisfies me that the mortgagee, HSBC Bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeds the purchase price of the property. No subsequent encumbrancers, competing creditors nor the Registered Owner's rights respecting redemption or preservation of equity (there is none) are adversely affected if the order is granted."
2_1999canlii12455.txt,"The primary issue was custody of the four children and dependent upon that determination, the quantum of child support. Matrimonial property owned at the time of separation in 1995 had been divided except for a pension and RSP. The parties agreed to joint custody in 1996 in an interim separation agreement and the father would pay support of $693.80 per month.HELD: 1)The evidence demonstrated a breakdown of the marriage as established by s.8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. 2)Joint custody was ordered such that the children would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. The most important consideration was stability which was to be found in the father's home. Only the best interests of the children must be taken into consideration as determined by the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children. 3)The child support payable by the father was reduced by 30 percent. The table amount for four children based on the father's income of $45,900 was $962 per month. The mother's income was below the level at which any support would be payable. Where there is a significant disparity in incomes, a straight set off as suggested in Hubic and Mertler may not be appropriate in all cases. It failed to take into account the father's more modest means and ability to pay the full table amount as well as support for four childen in his care 50 percent of the time. The shared custody arrangement which fell within s.9 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, did not necessarily lead to a reduction in the amount payable. There was no evidence of increased costs. 4)The parties agreed the registered retirement savings plan and employment pension should be divided equally after liabilities were paid. 5)No costs.","The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children. The primary issue between the parties was custody of the children. Ancillary to and dependent upon the determination of the custody issue, is the quantum of child support that will be payable by either party. The matrimonial property owned by the parties at the time of separation was divided between them to their mutual satisfaction. Both parties agreed that the application for dissolution of the marriage proceed pursuant to the counter-petition. HELD: The children were to be in joint custody with the mother and they would reside an equal amount of time in each home, alternating every two weeks. 1) The uncontradicted evidence indicated that the most important consideration for these children is stability. That stability is found in their father's home. The children are bonded to their mother. 2) There was no evidence of the increased costs of shared custody such that consideration could be given to s. 9(b) of the Guidelines. The evidence would be at best an estimate of the future cost of the new arrangement and necessarily lacking in precision. 3) The children would be removed from an environment that offers them the stability that they require nor from the specialized educational opportunities available to them in Saskatoon."
c_2016skqb269.txt,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused is charged with failing to ensure the health and safety of its employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a small pit in a grain terminal. In the course of repair to a large fan, an employee was injured by the moving fan blade. The incident occurred when the employee was in the process of unplugging a receiving pit in the terminal. The employee later died of suffocation. HELD: The Court found that the accused failed to adequately supervise the employee and failed to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee exercised due care and diligence to avoid the contravention. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. The accused was found to be in breach of s. 124 of the Canada Labour Code. As the employee had completed twelve CBT modules, he underwent some training and education. An 80% score was required to pass. In July, 2013, the employee told the accused that he had seen the employee look into the receiving pit and that it was there that he saw the employee. He then walked over to the accused's truck, where he asked him to look into another receiving pit, and when he did so, he was engulfed in the grain and suffocated. He did not receive any hands-on training on this subject."
c_2011nssc20.txt,"The plaintiffs, Steven and Jody Johansson, were injured in a single vehicle crash while driving with the plaintiff, Mary Johansson. They both received a damage settlement from, and signed releases in favour of, the vehicle's owner and his insurance company ('Citadel'). More than five years later, they brought this action against the car's manufacturer (the defendant, GMCL), claiming the accident was caused by an inherent flaw in the vehicle's design and seeking further damages. GMCL moved for summary judgement on the pleadings in relation to Steven and Jody Johansson, on the basis of the releases. They indicated that, should this matter proceed to trial, they would be joining Citadel as a third party. Motion granted; Steven and Jody Johansson's claims dismissed. There are no genuine issues for trial; the only facts in dispute relate to Mary Johansson. The releases were clear and unambiguous. Although neither plaintiff had the benefit of independent legal advice when signing, they both accepted payment in full and final settlement of any damages arising from the accident. They should not now expect to recover further compensation, especially where pursuing the claim will result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. While GMCL was not a party to the release, the release did contemplate third parties being covered insofar as those third parties 'might claim contribution or indemnity'. Both conditions from the SCC case of Fraser River [1999] have been met: the parties to the contract (Citadel and the plaintiffs) intended to extend the benefit in question to the third party seeking to rely on it; and the very activities concerned are those contemplated as coming within the scope of the contract in general. GMCL should be entitled to use the releases to defend the action brought by these plaintiffs. To allow the action to proceed would be an abuse of the court's process.","Two of the plaintiffs were injured in a single vehicle accident while passengers in the other plaintiff were in a vehicle driven by the defendant. Both were paid damages for the injuries they sustained. Both signed releases acknowledging full and final settlement of any claims arising from the accident. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were paid their damages. Both appeared to have understood the terms of the settlement and agreed to it voluntarily. Both stated that they should not now expect to be compensated further, particularly where to pursue a claim could result in a claim for contribution or indemnity against Citadel. This is indeed what could result based on the defence filed on behalf of GMCL. The defendant moved for summary judgment, dismissing the claims made by the two plaintiffs. There were no genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial. What facts are in dispute only pertain to the claim made by Maria Johansson. GMCL has passed the initial hurdle leaving it to the other two plaintiffs to establish, on the facts that are not in dispute, that their claim has a real chance of success. They have failed to do so. The parties are encouraged to try to reach an agreement on costs."
1999skqb29.txt,"In issue was whether the Town Council's proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the bylaw, were invalid by reason of bad faith and whether it met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting. HELD: The Town was prohibited from holding a public hearing with respect to the amendment to the zoning bylaw and from giving third reading to and adopting the bylaw. The application was dismissed in respect to the application for a discretionary use for a hotel development by the Palidwars. 1)The Town Council had acted openly and with candor. It did not have a duty to inform the applicants of the proposal because they were involved in the hotel industry. There was nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal and meetings in camera. 2)The shareholders' private interests were not being advanced rather than the community's best interest. Section 91(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and Harker v. Regina were noted. 3)There was nothing erroneous or improper in the method used to determine the selling price. 4)The question of the sale was still open. The Town was not subject to an unconditional commitment. The court could not intervene as it had not been established that the Town Council had fettered its discretion. 5)The process as a whole was tainted and should be set aside. The mayor and alderman, both shareholders and directors of the corporation, fell within the definition of partnership. They both had a pecuniary interest in the proposal within the meaning of the legislation. No finding was made that they acted with a dishonest or wrongful intent. The complaint respecting a violation of s.150(e) was not established. 6)It was not necessary to determine the adequacy of the notice required by s.207 of the Planning and Development Act. 7)It was beyond the court's jurisdiction to make an order prohibiting a hearing in respect to the application for a discretionary use by the Palidwars as they were not parties to these proceedings. The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT. The applicants sought an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development and from further considering an application for discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: The application was granted in part. The respondents were hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association. The proposal was based on a proposal by the applicants that was submitted to the Town Council for a public meeting. The Town Council had taken certain steps to bring the proposal to fruition, including the tentative sale of public lands and the introduction of Bylaw 756/99. There was a specific complaint of unfair advantage or discrimination by reason of the fact that the proposed hotel will be connected to the community. The Court found nothing improper about the initial confidentiality of the proposal or the meetings 'in camera' as the latter was made part of the public record."
2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The appellant sought a declaration to strike the appellant's claim under s. 36 of the Constitution Act. The chambers judge struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. The appellant appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the court found that, in the context of this appeal, the claim should be struck only if they appear to be absolutely unsustainable or certain to fail; the proposed interpretation offered by the appellant was simply too vague. As the appellant did not meet the burden of a conviction on its merits, the court held that the appeal should be allowed and reserved for the trial judge."

Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done. Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable. An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties.","The plaintiff obtained an oral agreement for the payment of a fixed commission, there were definite terms, that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the alternative an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. The plaintiff sought to withdraw his claim against the defendant and sought costs. HELD: The plaintiff was granted the requested costs on the basis of the first two paragraphs of the letter and the third paragraph of the second letter. The court found that the defendant did not intend to be bound by the terms of the agreement and that in the absence of an enforceable agreement the plaintiff was entitled to recover from the defendants based upon quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The Court ordered the plaintiff to provide written confirmation of his intentions within 7 days."
e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner’s Federal Child Support Guidelines to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The petitioner had been residing in Regina for the past few years and claimed that shared parenting and an equal division of family home and property had been his primary motivation for moving to Canada. The respondent, he maintained, wanted him to remain in Canada but felt that, since he was self-employed, he was not able to afford it. As for the parties’ debts, the petitioner claimed that he had obtained an interest-free loan from the respondent that was used primarily to pay child care, education and travel expenses. He also claimed that the respondent was a better parent because she had taken more time off work and had been able to spend more time with him. The court found the respondent to have an income of approximately $309,700.00, which was approximately double the amount he earned in the previous two years, and attributed the increase in income to increased access by the respondent. The Court also found that there were other outstanding debts owing to the health region in Ontario, which the petitioner had not been aware of prior to the commencement of his residency in Canada. These debts were the subject of an answer and counter petition filed by the petitioner against the respondent in January 2015 against them both on the basis that they had unilaterally transferred their son to the province. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted access on the first three weekends of each month, as well as every Wednesday.  2) The Court ordered the respondent paid interim child tax benefits of $3,000 per month for the first two years. 3) The petitioner was awarded access on alternate weekends. 4) The court prohibited the respondent from removing the petitioner from the province for any length of time. 5) On a balance of probabilities, the respondent would not be able to support himself on an ongoing basis due to the nature of his practice. On balance, the court found that it would be difficult for the petitioner to continue living in the province if he was permitted to travel to visit his son in the U.S. Further, the Court found that if the respondent had continued to work and did not wish to return to the country, he would be entitled to a portion of the monies from the Ontario monies for the RQHR loan"

HELD: The court declined to strike the claim. 1) Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out. A reasonable cause of action is disclosed. 2) None of the affidavits filed speak to the circumstance wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty.","FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation. The application is brought pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action as the case may be; (c) it is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and is otherwise an abuse of process; (d) it alleges malice; (e) it must not involve the satisfaction of some duty or interest which is unlawful or contrary to the public interest; and (f) the claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the defendant. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff will have his costs fixed at $400 in any event of the cause. 1) There may be merit to the defendant's claim but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. There is no reference to the alleged defamatory remarks. 2) As the plaintiff failed to plead any facts as to the dates on which these statements were supposed to have been made, and deprives the plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. 3) The statement of claim alleges malice. There must be some mutuality of interest or duty between the publisher and recipient. It must be shown that the publisher had some interest in making the communication, and those to whom it was made had a lot of interest in receiving it, or at least he or she was acting on behalf of someone who had such an interest. However, that does not mean that the statements must be made in a lawful occasion in order for the plaintiff to pursue an action for defamation. It fits within the regime set out in the Mitchell case."

A plaintiff should not be deprived of a trial because of an institutional scheduling error. The principles set out in Horosko v. Huber were applicable.,"The appellant/plaintiff's claim in Small Claims Court was dismissed by the Provincial Court judge for want of prosecution. The small claims summons was returnedable on August 6, 1998 and the respondents/defendants appeared in court on that date in response to it. The appellant was aware that the date on the note was August 6. But he appeared in accordance with the particulars of a note previously given to him by court staff indicating that the trial of his claim would take place on August 7. It appears the misunderstanding occurred because the date and court room number were inverted on the handwritten note. The respondents anddefendants declined to consent to an order directing a new trial even if the order awarded costs. HELD: The appeal was allowed. A new trial was ordered. 1)A plaintiff should not be deprived of his day in court because of an institutional scheduling error which arose through no fault on the plaintiff's part. A defendant in the circumstances should consent to a order directing new trial so that the claim can be presented and its merits determined by the court. A plaintiff in such circumstances has no recourse but to appeal to this court and incur the attendant expense to obtain the relief to which he is entitled. 2)Although the facts of the appeal were somewhat different, the principles set out in Horosko v. Huber were applicable. The appeal is allowed and a New trial is ordered. There is no order as to costs."

There was a favourable pre-sentence report suggesting good prospects for rehabilitation, and a joint sentence recommendation for two years' imprisonment followed by two years probation with strict terms, including 180 hours of community service.

The defendants counterclaimed for damages based on alleged negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff. The plaintiff had agreed to supply and erect a large sign for the defendant. The agreement was subject to receiving approval from the Department of Highways for a changeable message centre which was to be part of the sign. The plaintiff was to apply for the permit, as it was the signage expert. Although approval was never received, the sign was delivered and installed. The message centre was never activated, although the equipment was in place at the defendant's warehouse. Dismissing the claim for breach of contract and allowing the unjust enrichment claim, that government approval was a condition precedent to the agreement. Since approval was not forthcoming, the contract was null and void. The plaintiff's alternative claim for unjust enrichment was allowed against the corporate defendant, based on a reasonable monthly rental. The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed, as there was no negligent misrepresentation by the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, Sign-O-Lite, sought damages for breach of contract for alleged negligent misrepresentation.

When the defendant refused to allow the sign to be erected, the plaintiff sued the defendants, claiming unjust enrichment. The defendants counterclaimed for damages on the basis of unjust enrichment claims. Dismissing the counterclaim, that Clause 40 of the contract was a condition precedent to the Display Rental Agreement and since the approval was not forthcoming, the defendant were not liable for any breach.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the respondent held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit union became a tenant at sufferance when it failed to remove the quonal. The Court of Appeal allowed a Cross-Appeal and dismissed the appeal. The Credit Union appealed. It argued that s. 36 of the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intention. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs to the credit union in the amount of $6,227.88 plus costs. 1)The trial judge erred in dismissing the application. The material suggests the Applicant had no use for the building and wished it removed from the outset. The building was sold to a third party in the spring of 2001. However, it was not removed. The defendant took possession of the Building and rented it out for storage. These actions reflect the terms of its lease with Lakeland. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture in the Property, it is not being removed. 2)It is common ground that the defendant in this case will seek damages for unjust enrichment in the same amount as the damages determined in connection with the theft of the building. If that issue is decided in favour, it will also be necessary to consider the merits of the specific claims advanced by the plaintiff against the credit Union. If the claim is not precluded by the court, then Gari is entitled to relief."
2_2011skqb102.txt,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08. The Crown alleged that the trial judge erred in law by excluding two breath samples taken following the respondent's arrest on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter of Rights. During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand. The trial judge erred in finding the officer's subjective belief in impairment was not supported by the facts. The Certificate of Analysis was admitted as a full exhibit and became part of the Crown's case. The Crown had proven the offence beyond a reasonable doubt in all respects.","The Crown appeals from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of impaired driving. The Crown claims the learned trial judge erred in law in excluding two breath samples taken after the arrest of the accused on the basis that they were obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) While the trial judge was aware that an analysis of the reasonable and probable grounds (i.e. that the accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood) was not sufficient to set aside the conviction on the impaired driving charge. 2) The officer was entitled to consider the circumstance as whole and need not prove prima facie case. The Court must consider the subjective and objective factors, such as whether the accused's driving actions were reasonable at the time of the demand, the manner in which he was asked to act and the fact that he was attempting to obtain a breath sample constituted objective evidence of impairment. 3) The accused was subject to unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s. 253(b) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. The observations of the arresting officer upon which the officer formed reasonable, probable and objective grounds (e.g. that he had just swished with mouthwash because he could smell mints in the air) were sufficient to establish that his blood alcohol content was in excess of.08. The breath samples were received directly into the vehicle or into an approved container or an approved instrument operated by qualified technician and showed the accused the lowest of the concentrations of alcohol on his breath.  4) Although the accused was prone to slurred speech and confusion, the officer was of the opinion that his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol as shown by the reflective material on the side of the marked police cruiser. The reflective material could have been used to mask the odour of alcohol. 5) The Court cannot attribute the accused’s driving actions to anything other than being in a state of underemployment. The accused had not been drinking and was doing well in the field. 6) The U-turn, while illegal, was explained as part of the act of returning to Gerald in order to re-orient himself."
d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge erred by misapplying the test in Chaplin. He wrongly placed the burden on the defence to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. The court found that in light of the Crown’s late disclosure and non-disclosure, the trial judge erred by not a granting an adequate remedy to address the breach of s. 7 of the Charter by the Crown. In his decision regarding the adjournment request, the trial judge also erred in describing the index in this case as a Laporte inventory, a finding that allowed him to conclude that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations. The index was not a Laporte inventory as it was prepared for a different purpose and did not provide sufficient detail to permit the defence to decide whether to seek disclosure.","The accused, who was convicted of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine, applied for judicial interim release pending his appeal. In the weeks immediately before the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. The Crown sought to have the trial adjourned for a further day to allow proper review of the documents. During that time, defence counsel also requested that the trial be set aside and new trial ordered. HELD: The application to adjourn the trial was granted. The Court found that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to a miscarriage of justice as the accused could not demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. As the accused had disclosed the documents to defence counsel, the Court was in the same position as the trial judge and could not assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. A new trial was the only remedy available."
d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","The plaintiff claimed damages for a motor vehicle accident which occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a police vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. The plaintiffs claimed the defendant's headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights. There were two issues with respect to liability for the accident. First, the defendants claim the beams of the plaintiff's vehicle were not operated when it was approaching the intersection. The second issue is whether the plaintiff is contributory to the accident or negligent. HELD: The plaintiff was found to be in near perfect condition. The evidence from the lay witnesses and the officer who was in charge of the exhibits was accepted. There was no evidence the plaintiff braked or missed any action. The defendant did not appear to have noticed any of the accident scenes. To take the Level III course it was not necessary to take any preliminary courses. The only vehicle observed was the police vehicle which was about three to five minutes from the time she heard the screech of the brakes until she reached the officer's vehicle."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","The wife sought to diminish the injustice of her husband being left in poverty by the departure of the breadwinner in whose name most of the family assets were habitually held. He was given one-half of the only asset the family had. They would have to assume a large mortgage or move out of their modest $60,000 home to a far more modest home or to rental accommodation. HELD: The wife was awarded judgment for $1,945 plus an award of $5,000 for a total of $6,960.1. The matrimonial home had been divided between the wife and her 10 children prior to the marriage. The husband was given half of the equity, but the claim was in its entirety inequitable and had he not filed a counter petition there would have been no division, no trial and no excessive legal costs."
b_1990canlii4176.txt,"This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff had worked for 28 years for the defendant as a driver making deliveries to customers. The defendant dismissed the plaintiff for 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. The plaintiff had taken longer coffee and lunch breaks than were allowed, and had taken unauthorized breaks for which he had then been paid overtime by the defendant. For the defendant, that the dismissal was justified. The court considered seven factors in assessing whether the defendant had discharged the onus upon it to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal including whether the rules of the company had been distributed to the plaintiff, if the plaintiff was aware of the rules, whether the rules were consistently enforced, whether the plaintiff was properly warned of the consequences of breaching the rules, if the rules were reasonable, whether the breaches were sufficiently serious to justify termination, and whether a reasonable excuse existed for breaching the rules.",The plaintiff was employed by Sears as driver and driver's helper for 28 years. He was dismissed from the position without notice in 1988. He claimed that the breaks and breaks he took were for his meal and were part of a 'disregard of company policy related to hours of work and overtime'. HELD: The plaintiff's dismissal was justified. The defendant had satisfied the onus with respect to six factors. 1)The failure of the company to distribute the rules in writing was crucial. The onus is on the defendant to prove on the balance of probabilities that there was just cause for the dismissal of the plaintiff. 2)The disruption of company rules and the implication of breaking the rules was sufficiently serious to justify termination. The plaintiff knew that the company policy regarding breaks and overtime was strict. He and his partner were given a fifteen minute break each morning and forty-five minute break for lunch. 3)The plaintiff did not present any excuse to his employer at the time of his corrective interview in September nor at his termination interview. The parties also agree that the defendant company was justified in dismissing the plaintiff for his failure to abide by the company's overtime policy. 4)There was no evidence presented at the trial of any breaches of the policies or of the employer's compliance with the policy. The evidence did not support a reasonable explanation for the breaches. It was apparent that the policies were distributed and that the plaintiff was not given sufficient warning that he would be terminated if he failed to comply with them. The implications of breaking rules in question were sufficiently serious for termination. Whether a reasonable excuse exists.
5_2011nssc53.txt,"A co-executor and beneficiary under his mother's will, Mr. Hand applied for an order confirming her gift of a one-half interest in a condo held jointly by his parents until her death. His sister and his father, Dr. Hand, successfully defeated the motion, with the court holding the gift was invalid and the condo passed solely to Dr. Hand on Mrs. Hand's death. Dr. Hand abandoned his motion for costs, but Mr. Hand sought to have his solicitor-client costs paid out of the estate. In the alternative, he sought party and party costs against his father and sister. The parties will bear their own costs. There is no need to depart from the general rule that the successful party is entitled to costs. Here, this would be Dr. Hand but since he is not seeking costs, none will be awarded. As for the proposition that it's appropriate to have the estate pay costs related to estate litigation, it doesn't apply here. The will's meaning was not unclear, the gift was just invalid. The central issue was between Mr. Hand and his father: was Dr. Hand required to stand by his previous gift, and were the wills made by he and his wife mutual wills subject to a promise against revocation? In this sense, this was not estate litigation, but rather a dispute between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them.","The father, who claimed a one-half interest in a condominium held jointly by his parents until the death of his mother, sought party and party costs against his son. The father and his daughter were now acting on their own. HELD: The application was not 'estate litigation'. It was litigation between two living persons about the contractual obligations of one of them. The purpose of an award of costs is to provide the successful party with partial but substantial indemnity against legal fees measured by what would ordinarily be charged to client for the kind of work undertaken on behalf of the successfulparty in the actual case. The three parties will bear their own costs.  1) It was necessary for the estate to participate in the application because it originally involved questions about Mrs. Hand's property, it involved demand for accounting, and the late Mr. Thomas Burchell, Q.C., was subpoenaed to give evidence about both the administration of the estate and the wills he drafted. 2) The entire application was sham and that no lawyer should be paid anything. The central issue in the father's application was the meaning of his daughter's Will. She clearly made a gift to him that failed. The possibility of that failure was brought to the attention of the trustee before she executed the will. However, the issue was one between Mr. Hand and his father. Was Dr. Hand required to stand by his 1999 will, including the gift of the condominium to his son? The argument about the failure of the representatives of the Hand's estate to provide an accounting was resolved only as the hearing began.  3) The issues were not between the father and the applicant. It was the issue between the executor of the mother's estate, as well as the party who claimed one half interest. He was represented in his personal claim by Mr. Piercey, who had no involvement with the issues about estate accounting."
b_2010skqb249.txt,"The plaintiff veterinarian states that his personal and professional reputation has been damaged by defamatory statements made by the defendants. He worked at the veterinary college at the University of Saskatchewan, and an employee was involved in a grievance process. The plaintiff was involved by virtue of his supervisory position at the college. He asserts these statements were posted on bulletin boards in the plaintiff's workplace and postings on the union website. The statements were produced in connection with the labour grievance and alleged that the plaintiff failed to prevent harassment in the workplace in supervisory capacity or engaged in such harassment himself. The plaintiff seeks damages and costs. He states that he was pushed to leave his employment and is now engaged in private practice which pays less and is not as stable. He has incurred costs to move to the United States to obtain employment.HELD: The elements of defamation are: 1) the words would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person, 2) the words in fact referred to the plaintiff, and 3) the words were published (Grant v. Torstar Corp.). In these circumstances, the plaintiff was defamed. The defendants raise the defence of absolute privilege. This defence provides that 'no action for defamatory statements can exist where such statements are made in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings' (Getz v. Opseth). The Trade Union Act establishes mandatory arbitration for the resolution of labour grievances and empowers the arbitration board or chairperson with court-like functions and powers. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has found that an arbitration board fulfills quasi-judicial function (Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. v. Sulz). The Court does not allow the defence of absolute privilege as it is usually considered in the context of the actual hearing before the body. In this case, the statements were produced as a notice in order to bring further witnesses forward from the college. The Court instead determines the statements fall within the defence of qualified privilege. This applies in a situation where the statements are made in order to discharge the board member's duty. The Court finds the statements were made in order to gather further evidence and witnesses, which is part of the board's duties. The protection of qualified privilege may be removed on where there is evidence that the dominant purpose of the statements was malice. There is no such evidence in this case, therefore the defence of qualified privilege succeeds. Nonetheless the Court provides an opinion on damages on a provisional basis. There was no evidence that the plaintiff was forced to leave his position and move to the United States following the incident. The Court therefore concludes fair compensation would be $25,000. Since the results are mixed, there is no award of costs.","HELD: The court found the plaintiff had proven that he was defamed and accepted the defendants' defence of qualified privilege. The court ordered that none of the parties should receive costs. The plaintiff's claims were unfounded and without substance. He paid almost $14,000 in legal fees to facilitate his immigration to the United States and accepted expert's evidence that he had been perturbed by the defendant's attempts to prevent harassment and had been an active participant in the harassment himself. The defendants had failed in their duty to provide an adequate workplace environment. The impugned wording of the complainant's grievance was all the more troubling because the plaintiff was the director of the veterinary hospital and accordingly, the person ultimately responsible for insuring a harassment free workplace."
8_1998canlii13830.txt,"An appeal of conviction on a charge of dangerous driving on the grounds the trial judge erred in holding that statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in the criminal proceedings; and in holding the statements could have been made simply because the appellant wished to have his description of the accident presented to the police and therefore were voluntary and admissible. The defence at the voir dire was that the statement by the accused that he was the driver of the vehicle was given pursuant to the compulsion of a statute, s 83 of the Highway Traffic Act, and as such was not a 'voluntary' statement. Arguments during trial were based upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness. HELD: The appeal was allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. During the appeal it was recognized that the question of voluntariness raised a s7 Charter issue which was not raised in the trial nor in the notice of appeal. Objections to the admissiblilty of the accused's statements based upon the Charter raise a different issue and considerations from the application of common law principles and a different conclusion may have been reached.","The appellant appeals his conviction on a charge of dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge concluded that the statements made by the appellant were not made pursuant to the Highway Traffic Act and therefore admissible in criminal proceedings. A voir dire was conducted to determine whether or not the highway traffic act obligation to give a report to the police renders any statement made during the report involuntary. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The conviction setaside and a new trial in the Provincial Court is ordered. 1)Had the Charter issues been properly raised and arguedbefore the learned trial judge, a conclusion different from the one reached (based solely upon the application of common law principles of voluntariness) may have resulted. 2)The trial judge erred in holding that there was no evidence to indicate that statements made to the officer were made under the highway Traffic Act. The officer referred to the reason why the accused attended the police station and gave the information. Although the officer testified that it was his understanding the accused did so to give an accident report, the statement could have been made simply because the officer wished to have his description of the accidentpresented to police. 3)Had there been proper debate about the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials based upon Charter arguments, a consensus different from that reached by the Court of Appeal in Pelletier (1995), 97 C.C.C.(3d) 139, would have resulted in a different conclusion. 4)The appeal was allowed and the conviction set aside. A new trial was ordered. 5)The issue now raised is an important issue and impacts directly and perhaps conclusively upon the conviction of the accused. The determination of the Charter issue is at the heart of this case and may also be a different approach to the evidence that counsel for either the accused or the Crown may adduce in the voirs dire in order to establish the foundation for the Charter argument. In the end, the appropriate approach in disposing of this appeal is that taken by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of R. v.; Pelletiers. 6)The appropriate approach is that of the Court in the Kelletier case directing, as it did in that new trial be ordered."

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The accused was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for 90 days. 1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him was a contributing factor. 2)Although the accused had been involved in a night of drinking and partying without sleep, his driving was not extremely erratic or bizarre. He was aware he was driving a vehicle that was mechanically unsound and took the risk. It was significant to note that in almost all of the instances the accused was consuming alcohol and the consumption of alcohol appeared to be either the major cause of the fatality or a contributing contributor. 3)A sentence of imprisonment was imposed in the community where the offence occurred."
9_2008skqb301.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applies pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages in the plaintiff's claim. They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties reached an impasse on the required disclosure and sought various orders. The defendants sought an order for the Court to exercise its discretion and sever the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages and an order that certain paragraphs of the plaintiff's claim be struck. The plaintiffs are consultants to businesses applying for scientific research and experimental development grants from the Canada Revenue Agency (SR&ED). The defendant argues that he is bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants. By sharing this information with the other defendants, Wolff has breached that agreement and his contract of employment. Furthermore, the plaintiffs state that the defendant owes the plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, and by competing with the plaintiffs, he breached that duty. The plaintiff has developed their own SR&ED application process by cultivating relationships with accounting firms, industry associations, post-secondary learning institutions and various business organizations. Much of the defendant's client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidentiality and the plaintiffs could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that confidentiality. HELD: The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only had merit. The defendant's counterclaim against the defendants and their two principals was dismissed. Counsel for the defendants applied pursuant to Rule 41(1) and Rule 215 of The Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction for an order severing the issues of liability and assessment of damages. Application to strike portions of the claim dismissed. Because success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs. Any further applications pertaining to this litigation are to be directed to the first instance."
d_2016skpc19.txt,"HELD: The court found that the material viewed met the definition of child pornography as defined by the Criminal Code. Only the accused had access to his computer and knew his password. There was no evidence that the accused’s spouse was in any way involved. The evidence established that all of the file-sharing traffic came into the accused’s residence through a router that directed everything to the red computer only. The encryption on the red computer was so formidable that the best forensic technicians from the RCMP were not able to get past it. The court found that it would be unlikely for the accused not to detect a hacker given the encryption and his monitoring of bandwidth usage. A witness also testified that the accused’s operating system could not be accessed remotely. The court rejected the accused’s testimony given all of the Crown’s evidence. The Crown witnesses were all forthright and credible, whereas the accused was less forthcoming. The court found that the Crown met their burden of proving the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with possession of child pornography, contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the RCMP Internet Child Exploitation Unit (ICE) and testified that he monitored file sharing networks for subjects who were accessing, possessing, or sharing child pornography using file sharing software. The ICE unit was involved in the investigation. The Court testified that it was common for persons accessing the centralized server model to access the same server, same Internet address, and obtain the same information from the same physical location. In contrast, the peer to peer system is much different set up. It would contact a network that would contact other peers, people that had files that they might want and they could share files from many different sources. The software can't put those pieces together. The result is that if two people, in the same house downloaded Shareaza on their separate computers, they would have different G.U.I.D. numbers on their installation. The court was satisfied that the accused had a very good understanding of how computers work. The first issue on appeal was whether the accused, who was at the residence following a night shift, could have changed his address so that he could access the address of the person he wanted to contact. HELD: The Court granted the application for a search warrant and authorized the search of the entire duplex located within the RCMP campground. There were three computers seized. One computer had three hard drives, three of which were non-password protected. Examination of his computer did not yield any child pornography. The second computer, which was a laptop computer, had been tampered with so that it could not be accessed without a password. The third computer, a desktop computer, and an external hard drive were all seized. During the course of the search, the accused was subject to numerous requests for change of his IP address. During his investigation, the Court was also required to determine the physical address and name of the subscriber because two hours later that would be when the search warrant was executed."
7_2013skqb67.txt,"The petitioner and the respondent had separated and had held a settlement meeting regarding the resolution of various issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The 3 children of the marriage resided with her in it. She had recently obtained a position as an educational assistant and would be earning $19,000 per year and the petitioner's annual income was $87,000. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference.","In Tucker-Lester v. Lester, the court canvassed the principles underly settlement privilege. The court noted that settlement privilege is a jointly held privilege which cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit of October 2012. The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent is to pay child support of $500 per month and the petitioner $400 per month. 2) The parties have three children. They now have shared parenting arrangement and the respondent applies for interim exclusive possession of the family home. The parties agree that the meeting is without prejudice. 3) There is no evidence that any agreements reached at the meeting could be used in evidence.  4) The Court reviewed the circumstances at hand and found the petitioner to have a Guideline income of $87,178 and that the respondent a figure of 81.5%. The respondent's share of s. 7 expenses is 81.1%. The policy considerations which underly settal support and s. 9(a) of the Divorce Act require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may be a consensus. Whether the respondent should be employed at something which is 40 hours per week year round is an issue which will be left to the pre-trial conference."
a_1995canlii4000.txt,"The Appellant/Defendant, Bennett appealed a judgment resulting from a jury trial. At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings. The Respondent/Plaintiff cross-appealed on the issue of whether the trial judge should have directed the jury to deduct sick leave benefits from her past loss of income. Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, a verdict was pronounced awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent. The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in law in failing to caution the jury regarding the weight to be given to the testimony of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence. HELD: 1)The jury was instructed to consider the present value of the respondent's earnings and future loss of earnings. 2)The respondent was to receive salary or wages at periodic intervals until retirement, lay-off, or death. 3)The award for loss of income was reduced to $5,553.18 with pre-trial stipulation. 4)No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was demonstrated but in the circumstances of this case the Court was limited to dismissing the appeal or ordering a new trial. 5)The appellant's claim was dismissed. 6)The appropriate lump sum was not available at the conclusion of litigation. 7)The trial judge properly instructed the respondent on the limited purpose for which she could have been expected to work and the use of a computer program to assist her in calculating future income."

He argued the youth court judge erred in concluding statements made to the police were made voluntarily. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that both the appellant's sister and girlfriend gave evidence of inducements by the police to the accused to admit to the alleged crimes, in return for a lighter sentence. The trial judge failed to address this evidence, thereby committing a palpable and overriding error.","The young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault claimed that the statements taken from him by the Youth Court Police were voluntary. He appealed his convictions on the basis that the impugned statements had been made in compliance with the provisions of s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act. The Youth Court judge found that if the statements were not admissible, then there was no evidence of guilt on the remaining eight charges. He therefore allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial with respect to the eight charges which were based solely on the statements. The trial judge did not make any findings of fact or credibility on this essential matter."
e_2001nssc162.txt,"The defendant made an addition to single family residence. Following a dispute between the parties as to whether the defendant's use of the property now complied with the plaintiff's land-use bylaw for a single family residence, a consent order was issued dealing with the structure of the property and how it would be used. The plaintiff sought a finding that the defendant was in contempt of the consent order, seeking enforcement of the provisions of the consent order and an order that the defendant pay a fine. Defendant found in contempt of consent order; fine ordered in the amount of $10,000; if defendant has not complied with the terms of the consent order by January 31, 2002, the Sheriff is ordered to enter the property and receive the rents, profits and income thereof until the defendant clears his contempt; the door and hardware between the original structure and the addition is be removed; any references to separate apartments are to be removed from the property; the second power meter is to be removed from the property and the second cable television connection and associated billing provisions are to be eliminated; the defendant is to provide within 15 days the names of all tenants and if and when there are changes in any of the tenants, he must provide the plaintiff with the particulars of the new and remaining tenants; all tenants must be notified in writing prior to entry of occupation that the entire structure and building is only to be occupied as a single dwelling unit; copies of any written leases are to be provided to the plaintiff within 15 days of their execution; the plaintiff can enter the premises for the purposes of random inspection on a bi-monthly basis until the plaintiff is satisfied that this Order has been complied with and thereafter, the plaintiff is entitled to inspect the premises at random once a month while the defendant remains the owner of the property; the fine will not be crystallized into a judgment and execution if the defendant complies fully with all the requirements of this order on or before January 1, 2002. The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor-client costs.","The owner of a rental property applied for a variance converting the existing use to a two unit dwelling without changing the side yard requirements. The application was withdrawn and the owner, in turn, sought a finding that he was in contempt of the Consent Order. HELD: The dwelling was in contravention of the Land Use By-laws. A fine was not to be crystalized into a Judgment and Execution. The owner was entitled to proceed with the taxation of costs and disbursements. 1)The owner did not consented to the order. He was to provide a copy of the lease signed by the tenants and a clear explanation within the lease that the rent for the entire structure was to be paid as one single payment to the landlord collectively by all of the tenants. 2)There was nothing in the owner's affidavit or the Affidavits of any of his tenants to indicate any concrete steps he had taken to rectify the situation. The inspection capacity was limited to twice a month and bi-monthly inspections were to continue until the City was satisfied that the Order had been complied with. 3)The Court found that the owner was in breach of the January 9th, 2001 Order. It ordered an assignment of the rents to the sheriff until December 1st, 2002. 4)In order to ensure compliance with the order the owner must comply with random inspections which could be every week, the Court imposed fines in the amount of $25,000. 5)It found no other reasonable inference that he intended to circumvent the By-law and intended to disobey it. He proceeded to do so on the mistaken belief he could somehow get out of it."
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel. Although greater deference is shown to decisions of consensual arbitrators than to those of statutory arbitrators, consensual arbitrators are not immune from judicial review if the means of reaching the result were unreasonable. The results reached within the arbitrator's jurisdiction were not patently unreasonable.","The lease between the Landlord and the Tenant contained an arbitration clause. The Tenant sought to have the award of the arbitrator made pursuant to that clause quashed. The issues were: 1) Did the loss occur as a result of the acts or omissions of the Tenants or its servants and agents; was the loss covered by insurance and whether notification or claim was required; if so, was estoppel and whether insurance should have covered the damages. 2) Was the arbitration clause a limited arbitration clause? Had it been a case, in the face of a strong privative clause, that it was immune from judicial review, even if patently unreasonable? 3) If so, what was the extent of the damages? Estoppel should not be limited to the wording of the clauses of the lease. Where there is an error going to jurisdiction, judicial review is the proper remedy. The more specialized the tribunal the less inclined the courts should be to be to interfere with its awards. Here the courts in both directions agree that the standard of review is correctness with respect to the issue of jurisdiction. The arbitrator was not limited to interpreting the words in the lease but could deal more broadly with the clauses and their contents. The disputes were the result of acts or errors of the tenants and the landlords. There was no evidence that the tenants were contributing to the damage or that the damages were due to the actions of the landlords or the tenants themselves. To determine the scope of review, the court must look carefully at the decision.HELD: The decision of the majority in Lester was held to be a clear case of exceeding his jurisdiction. It does not appear that the expanded scope of judicial review reached its conclusion in either Lester or Paccar. The decision in Corn Growers establishes a need for particularly restricted scope for judicial review in the case of consensual arbitrations."
c_1999canlii12484.txt,"In issue was whether the law firm was in a conflict of interest with respect to two matrimonial files and whether the firm could remain as counsel for the spouses. HELD: 1)A lawyer with Olive Waller acts as counsel for Janie Magnes and Daniel L'Heureux. The lawyer who recently joined the law firm of Olive Waller had worked on both files of the opposing spouses while practicing law with another firm. At the time she left she was the solicitor for Mr. Magnes. She had received confidential information from both opposing spouses. 2)The screen was sufficient and there was not a risk of mischief in the circumstances of this case. There was no real risk that either would be prejudiced if the law firm continued to act. A reasonable member of the public, in possession of the facts and aware of the screening procedures set in place, would conclude that no unauthorized disclosure of confidential information occurred or would occur. There were numerous independently verifiable steps taken by the subsequent firm to implement screening. Both lawyers and support staff were instructed in writing not to discuss either matters or the lawyer's prior representation of those clients with her. The files were physically segregated from the regular filing system in a locked cabinet. The files were specifically identified and accessible only to those lawyers and support staff who were working on the matter. The computer files were encoded and segregated on the firm's network and access was limited to two people. 3)There was no order as to costs.","This was an application for a determination as to whether the law firm of Olive, Waller, Zinkhan & Waller is in a position of conflict of interest with respect to the matrimonial files.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 253(2) and 254(1(a)) of the Code. As counsel for the accused provided notice of his intention to raise certain Charter issues, the evidence of a third Crown witness was called on voir dire. His testimony is the only evidence left for the Court to consider in determining the Charter application. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: 1) Based on the totality of the above evidence, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to conclude that the accused was impaired. The Court found that the admission of the evidence in the face of a breach so created would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 2) It is well settled that there is a subjective and objective component to finding that reasonable grounds exist within the meaning of s. 254(3). Although the onus lies upon an accused to establish a Charter violation on a balance of probabilities, demand for breath samples amounts to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The more serious or deliberate state conduct, the more likely the courts should be to disassociate from that conduct by weighing in favour of exclusion. 3) Any potential violation of the rights of this accused would fall toward the lower end of the spectrum. The breach was not the result of wilful or blatant disrespect of the Charter by the officer nor did he have the grounds to arrest for impaired driving, thus the arrest was unlawful, the search unreasonable and the rights obtained were violated. 4) The officer subjectively believed that he had reasonable ground to arrest the accused, which was true. If the grounds fell short objectively, the accused displayed very significant symptoms of impairment and drove in fashion indicative of a marked departure from the norm. This is not a situation where there was nothing to substantiate the subjective belief held by the police officer; what was lacking was a smell of or admission of consumption of alcohol."
4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one. The correctness test was applicable to general questions of law. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the decision of an adjudicator made pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The grounds relied on by the appellant were: (1) Did the adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract; (2) Whether he exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a matter of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work; and (3) Whether the adjudicating adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence upon which he could arrive at his conclusions. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. The adjudicator's decision did not meet the standard of patently unreasonable conduct which was the standard applicable to general questions of law. The appeal based on the submission that the employer was incapable of performing it sobligations (i.e. permitting the employee to access the workplace without proper notice of termination) was incorrect. Only in an event such as this could lead to an unreasonable invasion of the individual's privacy."
6_2002nsca46.txt,"The plaintiff appealed an interlocutory decision in which the chambers judge held that a non-party medical doctor who had provided emergency treatment to the plaintiff did not have to answer certain interrogatories on the basis that they required an opinion. The admitted purpose of the appellant was to use these answers as his expert evidence at trial. Appeal allowed in part; the chambers judge did not err in refusing to appoint the doctor as a court expert where he indicated that he did not wish to be an expert; the chambers judge did err in finding that opinion evidence is never required to be given. Opinions that go into the formation of the doctor's judgment in diagnosing and treating the appellant are to be provided. However, opinions typically asked of an expert witness with respect to the medical services provided by the respondent that were not formed as part of his diagnosis and treatment of the appellant are not required to be provided. Interrogatories cannot be used to usurp the Rules surrounding the use of expert evidence.","Dr. Miller is a urologist who treated the appellant three days after he underwent a circumcision on him. The appellant commenced an action against the respondent alleging negligence in the performance of the circumcision. There is no action against Dr. Miller nor any allegation of wrongdoing by him. However, the chambers judge erred by overstating the basis upon which a non-party witness may object to answering an interrogatory calling for an opinion, when he stated that in the event the appellant serves further interrogatories or requests discovery of Dr.Miller, the appellant will pay the appellant's reasonable hourly rate. The issue before the appellant is whether the opinions sought by the interrogatories are opinions which CPR 19 requires be provided to him. HELD: Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed in part.  1) The detail required by this Rule ensures the factual basis of the expert’s opinion is clear to the trier of fact, who will have to assess the weight to give an opinion taking this into account and ensures adequate notice to the parties of experts opinions to avoid surprise and help the third party discover the truth. This rule also provides specifically for discoveries of experts and their reimbursement. To allow interrogatories to be used to usurp this function without the presence of such safeguards for the parties, the experts and the court, would not be in accordance with the orderly and fair trial practice and procedure that the Civil Procedure Rules promote.  2) It is not sufficient for the appellant to have objected to answer the balance of interrogatories by simply stating they require an opinion. Depending on the nature of the opinion, it may be necessary for him to provide it. Alternatively, he may raise a properly supported and articulated objection to answering any particular one as he may be advised, which he may do. 3) The appellant is not entitled to rely on the standard of review as it was in Christensen v. Sinclair. 4) While recognize medical terminology may be involved, in answering these questions the appellant should attempt to use language that can be understood by the appellant, his counsel and the Court may have misapprehended the facts. This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles were applied or manifest injustice has resulted.  5) The issues listed by the applicant are: Is the appellant in breach of his own Code of Ethics? 2. Should the appellant be appointed a court expert and be required to answer interrogatories that require his opinion; what the appellant did during the first operation and why it was necessary to do second corrective surgery; should the appellant"
2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The accused were convicted of using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The accused appealed their conviction on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellants as Metis (Indians) within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with searchlight. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate aboriginal peoples' right (s.11.1) and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights. The appellants have failed to show any error in law by applying the justification test pursuant to Sparrow.  2)Solemn and historical Aboriginal rights protected by s.7 and s.8 of the Constitution Act, 1867, were clearly subject to federal and provincial legislation if the legislation does not constitute prima facie infringement of those rights. 3)The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. There was no infringement of aboriginal rights arising from the legislation. The question was whether the legislation had an avalid objective? Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples? Has there been as little infringement as possible? 4)Had the Aboriginal group been consulted? The answer was yes. The trial judge applied the Sparrow test of infringement and justification to the issue. The issue was whether s.11.(3) infringed the accused's aboriginal right and if so, whether it was justifiable.  5)The court was unable to accept that the appellant's argument that night hunting with artificial lights was not part of any aboriginal hunting right, and even if it was, it was justified because of the strong safety factor. 6)The appellants were not subject to the restrictions imposed by the Regulations. They enjoyed aboriginal hunting rights independent of s.35(1). The regulations did not affect their Aboriginal right.  7)The appeal was also dismissed on the ground of an error in assessment of the facts."

2_2008nssm4.txt,"The Director of Residential Tenancies ordered compensation after he found that the landlord allowed mouldy conditions to develop in the premises and failed to rectify same, with the result that some of the tenant's belongings were ruined. The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","The Landlord and Tenant appealed a decision of the Director allowing the Landlord the sum of $787.50 as compensation for a breach of the statutory condition to provide premises suitable for habitation. The Landlord had allowed mould to develop in her basement, which was riddled with mould. She also produced evidence of medical letters to the effect that her children suffered from asthma and ought not to be exposed to mould. The mother of two children testified that she was affected by the mould. Photographs of the mouldy conditions were placed in evidence. She testified that the landlord was totally unresponsive to her complaints throughout. She even used grey spray paint to resemble mould to resemble the mould, none of which had any bearing on the alleged mould issue. She questioned why if there was mould that only affected the Tenant's furniture and area rug and was not obvious on the other carpeting. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Director was essentially correct in discounting of the value of the furniture and clothing. She was not credible and her explanation was not probable. 2) The damages were rejected. There was a legitimate claim for general damages of $862.50, but the general damages claim was simply too high. 3) The evidence advanced by the bylaw inspector was so far apart that it was impossible to believe he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint. He detected mould and the conditions caused mould. He was able to find the cause of the problem which was the lack of proper ventilation in the basement. The Tenant should have called in a building inspector."
9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The applicant was the survivings spouse of the deceased who died in a motor vehicle accident. Any benefits she was entitled to receive were in accordance with the Automobile Accident Insurance Act as amended by the Automotive Accident insurance Amendment Act, 1994. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit that should be paid to her as surviving spouse. SGI had calculated the payment based on a percentage of her late husband's net income rather than on his gross income. She appealed the Queen's Bench decision. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The simple formula used by SGI to calculate the death benefits for the surviving spouse was not the same as that used in Division 4. The 'income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 was a different statutory creature than the 'incomereplacement benefit'. 2)SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. The death benefit is 50% of that net income. 3)The formula in s.146(1) was not used in the manner prescribed by s.142(1)(j). SGI was ordered to recalculate the benefit for the deceased spouse based on her gross yearly employment income. 4)Costs were awarded on the basis of interest not paid."
8_2000skqb570.txt,"The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender of four made in response to the defendant's invitation to tender on a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The tender package contained the usual privilege clause which stated the lowest tender need not be accepted. It is an implied term of the contract that the person inviting the tenders agrees to treat all tenders fairly and will not give any an unfair advantage.  2)The plaintiff had no experience in the type of pesticide spraying. It was not known at the time that the plaintiff made arrangements to hire an experienced subcontractor. The consultant hired to advise the defendant on the technical aspects of the project used reliable independent sources for his information about the operational viability of the planes. He followed common industry practice and conducted his investigation of the planes to be used by the plaintiff in a fair and impartial manner.  3)Discretion was exercised to deny costs because, while the plaintiff was treated fairly and the reason its tender was rejected was due to negative reports, the recommendation contained other reasons which led the plaintiff to believe it did not get fair treatment.","The defendant, the Government of Saskatchewan, tendered a spruce bud worm aerial spraying program in northern Saskatchewan. Four companies submitted tenders in response to the defendant's invitation to tender. The plaintiff submitted the lowest tender, which was awarded to another tenderer who had previous experience in the area and whose planes received favourable reports. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the successful party. 1)An implied term of fairness and the privilege clause are compatible and can co-exist in the contract. The person who invites the tenders must treat all tenderers fairly and equally. It was based on factors relevant to the project: The experience and capabilities of tenderers and the equipment to be used on the project. In every case, the person who had the task of investigating the planes the tenderers proposed to use, did not check the log books of any of the planes he investigated because he testified it was not common practice to do so and it would have given him little relevant information on the operational viability of the plane. 2)Curniski conducted his investigation in a fair and impartial manner and in accordance with common industry practice.  3)It was settled law that the submission of a tender in a response to an invitation to a tender may give rise to contractual obligations—depending upon whether the parties intend to initiate contractual relations by the submissions of tender. In the case of Nielsen Ashdown, the plaintiff had compensated for its lack of experience by making arrangements to bring on board an experienced sub-contractor, a fact Stanley did not know at the time he made his recommendation. The defendants could have been more thorough in evaluating and investigating tenders, but for the most part they relied heavily on the advice of Gregory CurniskI, a consultant who was advising the defendant."
d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted. The children were to remain in the mother's care for six months and that the mother would continue to work with the Harm Reduction Methadone Program and take anger management courses. The father proposed that he would continue living with the mother and the children while the mother first attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems. The evidence showed that the father had a substantial criminal record, including 16 youth offences as youth. The convictions for youth offences were dated between May 2000 and June 2008 and the last conviction was in January 2006 for which he received 7 months incarceration. As the mother had been on the methadone program for most of her life, the father was aware that she was prone to addictions and had signed a PSA stating that the children would remain drug free and provide all drug screen results. Although the mother was not opposed to the father's proposal, she questioned the appropriateness of the wording of the PSA as to whether it was for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. Regarding the father, he argued that he was not seeking a return of the children to the mother directly but that he had been advised by the Ministry that he planned on residing with her for the duration of the order and that if the mother did not cooperate with the Ministry's placement plans, he would be responsible for the children's health care expenses and the father would have to pay child support and the costs associated with the placement. The mother was to have regular weekly parenting time with the children and to have weekly two hour supervised visits with the father when the children were in the care of the Ministry. Although H.H. was represented by the mother, she did not testify and her history can only be gleaned from the documents which have been filed as exhibits and the testimony of others."
6_2014skpc40.txt,"Criminal Law – Recognizance The defendant was a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14-year-old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on a s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance upon his release from prison in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown then applied for a third recognizance. An RCMP officer with the High Risk Offender/Serious Violent Offender Response Unit swore an Information that he had reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant would commit either a serious personal injury or a sexual assault offence against someone under the age of 16 years and requested that he be bound over. A parole officer with Correctional Services Canada also testified to the defendant’s history in the federal prison and to her belief that based, upon his history, the defendant remained at high risk to re-offend. The Crown indicated that it was looking for one recognizance, either under s. 810.2 or s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 59 prior criminal convictions, 12 of which related to sexual or common assaults. He had a serious alcohol abuse problem and committed most of the assaults while intoxicated. While in prison, he had refused to participate in programming. As a high risk to re-offend for sexual offending, the defendant was required to complete high-intensity sex offender programming but had not availed himself of the opportunity to do so during the last four years. HELD: The Court granted the recognizance to bind the defendant over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Code because it agreed with the beliefs and opinions expressed by the witnesses and their evidence that they believed that he would re-offend in a violent or sexual manner, which posed an imminent danger to public safety.","The accused is a repeat violent and sexual offender who was still serving a sentence for sexual assault and out on a weekend parole pass when he committed his last sexual assault offence against his 14 year old niece. He was returned to prison and served his entire sentence to warrant expiry before being placed on s. 810.1 peace bond recognizance in 2010 and then again in 2012. The Crown now applies for third recognizances. HELD: The accused is granted a security bond. The Court finds that an objective person armed with the same knowledge would agree that the fears of Corporal Teniuk, the RCMP Sergeant in charge of the RCMP High Risk Offender Response Unit, and Ms. Woytiuk, a Parole Board member with over 20 years of experience, that he will commit either a serious personal injury offence or sexual assault involving someone under the age of 16 years and requests that the accused be bound over to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.  1) The accused has 59 prior criminal convictions, mostly for sexual assaults and common assaults against his spouse. There is both subjective and objective component to his beliefs that must be established by the Crown (i.e. that he was assessed as a high risk to re-offend) and should therefore be disregarded. 2) There are common underlying principles applicable to both. R.N.S. is not charged with a criminal offence. No criminal conviction flows from person entering into such recognition. SCCA is designed to be preventative rather than punitive measures. While both impose restrictions upon an individual's freedoms, such restrictions are only those as are necessary to assist the individual from committing future offences or misconduct. Having the accused reside in the community without strict conditions is jeopardizing the safety of the young people within the community. The accused's high risk areas are: domestic violence, sexual assault, substance abuse, and sexual assault. He has demonstrated a lack of self-control and impulse behaviour. He did not sufficiently address these high risk issues, especially the substance abuse issue which affects the others."

The judge made no error in ruling that all of the evidence from the prospective witnesses and transcripts was irrelevant as being unrelated to the charges and too remote in time. The appellant's state of mind was adequately established by his own evidence and the summation to the jury. The defence was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it.

All of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments. They unanimously agreed that the sentence should be dismissed.

One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning Canada Inc. (DOW). In 1990, the plaintiff received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. In 1992, she had the breast implants removed. The plaintiff presently suffers from fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a persistent immune mediated skin rash. It is alleged that her condition is a result of negligence attributed to the defendants. Dow Chemical denies liability.

The court found that the bankrupt was 43 years old, in good health and with no dependents. The bankrupt was also a self-employed contractor with an 'enviable' income.

Allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, that the trial judge did not rely on the prima facie effect of the Crown's evidence, but rather had ample evidence concerning the accuracy of the scales upon which to rely.","The three respondents were convicted, after their trials, and fined for operating overweight vehicles on the Bedford Highway. The offence with which each was charged was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act, then s. 172 of the Nova Scotia 1967, and now s. 192 of the Department of Transportation, and the Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The Crown appealed the convictions. Dismissing the appeals, that on the strength of the evidence, it was shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was operating his vehicle well above the permitted weight and tolerances on the highway. The evidence before the trial judge was that the truck of each defendant was weighed by a peace officer, who first had reason to believe each vehicle was overweight. Mobile scales authorized by the Province of the province were used to weigh each vehicle in the manner provided by the Regulations. In each case each weighed considerably in excess of the allowable tolerance of 500 kilograms. The weights of the vehicles, how they were weighed and the procedures followed by the Departmentof Transportation in determining and maintaining the accuracy of the mobile scales were met. Although the legal effect of s. 174 (now s. 193) was argued before the Provincial Court judge it was not necessary for him to either invoke or rely upon s.174 nor did he in finding each of the respondents guilty of the offence. These three respondents did not fall in this category."

Costs were at issue for the summary judgment application as well as a previous application brought by the defendant to compel document production. The defendant's application was resolved prior to being heard in Chambers, but only after discovery examination was held in New York. Costs awarded for the summary judgment application on the basis of $2,000 per day for a total of $4,000 (the plaintiff is not precluded from seeking further costs after damages have been determined), plus taxable disbursements; costs awarded on the defendant's application as a half-day Chambers application in the amount of $1,000, with the plaintiff to also pay the disbursements incurred by the defendant in filing the application; travel costs for the defendant's counsel to attend in New York; and the costs of preparation, travel, food and lodging for its expert witness to attend the discovery.",The court granted summary judgment for the company's alleged failure to supply coal under a Coal Supply Agreement. The decision left it to counsel for the parties to try to reach an agreement on costs. Counsel for the plaintiff declined to produce the documents requested. The application for summary judgment was adjourned pending the appeal of the decision on summary judgment. The affiant was an expert retained by the company to provide an opinion on the commercial reasonableness of the purchase of substitute coal by the defendant. The expert advised the plaintiff that he was unable to carry out the analysis due to the insufficiency of materials. The discovery hearing took place in New York City in order to reduce some of the inconvenience and costs of conducting it in the United States of America where the witness resides.

There is another defamation action, described in this judgment as the College Action. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 41(2) that his action and the College Action be tried together because there are common issues of fact between the two, albeit different actions.  Trying them together would be in the interests of judicial economy and avoid the possibility of conflicting findings.

College of Physicians and Surgeons, Don McMorris and Sunrise Health Region, being Q.B. 1008 of 2011 be tried together. The plaintiff alleges the defendant defamation was justified in law. The defendant says the claims are different. He says this claim relates to a single issue relating to the x-ray, and does not relate to the broader issues of competence at issue in the College Action. HELD: The defendants were given leave to amend their Statement of Defence. 1)The actions have questions of law or fact in common, or that the background evidence required to place the issues in context is sufficiently common that a judicial economy would be achieved by having the actions tried at the same time. The fact that the actions arise out of the same transactions or occurrences is relevant, but not determinative, in the absence of common questions of fact or law. Judicial economy is at stake. 2)The court was not satisfied that this draft order provided for trials to be conducted in the manner that best achieves the goals of judicial economy and justice that are the underpinning for joinder of actions.

The main issue was whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellant received when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. The couple's marriage had lasted less than four years. HELD: The QB judgment was upheld regarding the severance package. The severance package was not a reward for past service; it was for payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination. The severance package was based on future earnings, which would have occurred within the duration of the marriage. The QB judge did however fail to take into consideration that the wife had taken a quantity of furniture and household goods and that, as a result, he failed to give the husband his one-half share of them. Judgment varied accordingly.","This was an appeal from a judgment under The MatrimonialProperty Act which dealt with whether the judge erred in his distribution of assets acquired with the proceeds of a severance package which the appellantreceived when his employment of twenty-three years was suddenly and unexpectedly terminated. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent referred to in the judgment. 1)The award of $110,000 was not a reward for past service nor a compensation for remuneration that would have been paid after the cessation of the marital relationship. It was a discretionary award based on 20.4 months of future earnings. 2)The judge was expressly required to arrive at a balance between the value of the matrimonial property and the amount of the adjustment. The court found no basis upon which to change the disposition. 3)The court found there was a prima facie error in the law in approving the award of the sum of $16,392, which was the amount the appellant purportedly received from the respondent."

e_2015skqb345.txt,HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants. It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification. The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages. The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. There was no genuine issue requiring a trial. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them. It was not necessary to decide the application for certification.,"The original plaintiff issued his claim under The Class Actions Act for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act and a waiver of tort. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaws Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. (Loblaws). The claim also seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the defendants' 'low sodium' beverages (the 'Class' or 'Class Members'), but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-Low Sodium beverages. The defendants claim that they have made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling 'Low the Low Sodium' beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no higher or appreciably lowers in sodium, and that the plaintiffs' argument set out in their brief has no factual basis. HELD: The application for summary judgment was granted.  1)The Court was comfortable with following this judicial authority and determining the defendants’ summary judgment application prior to having to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification. There was no genuine issue for trial and the expert evidence submitted by the plaintiffs was uncontroverted. 2)It is of no concern that the Court would require conventional trial. It would be potentially open for other representative plaintiffs to come forward by issuing a new claim under the Class Actions act. 3)While there may be a genuine issue to be had in the class action context, the Court was not comfortable with determining the defendant’s application for dismissal. The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw and quality of the material and found that most importantly, the accused had not specifically directed her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the facts were undisputed and her conclusion was without proper foundation or basis. 4)It was not necessary for the Court to look at the issues at hand to determine whether the defendants had misled consumers.

e_2008skpc108.txt,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","The plaintiffs sued the defendant corporation for the return of a substantial amount of money. The defendant corporation was in the business of building decks and sunrooms and had been for 18 years. The plaintiff wanted to construct a glass sunroom on the back of their home and had obtained a detailed quotation from Pacific Home Products Ltd. for the construction of a concrete pad and pillar system. After the land purchase contract was entered into, and prior to construction, the defendant changed the material used in the project to concrete pilings which would be used as foundation support. The defendants then sued the plaintiff in a counterclaim for $3,604.13, which represented the defendant's misappropriation of funds from the plaintiff. In the counterclaim, the plaintiff argued that the defendant breached its contractual obligation by failing to pay the plaintiff $2,200.13 deposit which it was entitled to on a 65/35 ratio. Each party will bear the risk of its own lost expenses. The contract was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. Neither party could have foreseen this issue. The parties could not come to an agreement as to how to remedy the frustrated contract. The court found that the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiff 35% of loss.

The actus reus of the act was clearly proved at trial. The trial judge acquitted as a result of his finding that the legislation was ultra vires the Province. He reasoned that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, that the federal legislation cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation, and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. The trial judge further commented that, had the Act been constitutional, he would have convicted because he did not accept the accused's defence of due diligence. The Crown appealed, and the accused cross-appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system.","The appellant appealed its acquittal on a charge that it sold tobacco or a tobacco product to a person under the age of 19 years contrary to s. 5(1) of the Tobacco Access Act.

The trial judge found that federal legislation had 'occupied the field' with the Tobacco Act, S.C. 13, that it 'cannot stand side by side with the provincial legislation', and that the federal legislation therefore prevails. Having found the legislation to be unconstitutional, an acquittal was entered. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the matter of the trial judge's decision, that he erred in finding the provincial Statute unconstitutional."

The police had stopped the respondent when they observed the passenger putting on a seat belt. When the respondent went to the police cruiser, the police observed signs of impairment. The summary conviction appeal court held the stop was random and constituted an arbitrary detention infringing the respondent's s.9 Charter rights. The Crown appealed. Allowing the appeal and restoring the conviction. Random stops are arbitrary detentions infringing the Charters. 9 but are saved by s.1. They are authorized in Nova Scotia under Motor Vehicle Act provisions. In the course of checking licences, registration, insurance policy and mechanical condition police are justified in making observations to detect drinking drivers; the right to counsel under s. 10(b) is suspended during this period.","The respondent was convicted of driving with an illegal blood alcohol level. His summary conviction appeal was allowed on the basis that he had been arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the Charter and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) was infringed. The Crown appealed on the ground that the trial judge erred respecting arbitrary detention and the exclusion of evidence of the breathalyzer test. Issues The respondent had been randomly stopped by police officer in a bar. The stop was conducted in order to check licences, insurance, and, if not for a breath test, to look at the driver's licence and proof of insurance. After the stop, the officer asked the respondent to accompany her back to the police cruiser. The respondent refused and the officer told the respondent that he would be charged with failing to provide a breath sample and that he was to lose and instruct counsel without delay. The trial judge concluded that although the stop was arbitrary, it was justified because it was urgent and that the breath sample be obtained quickly. The police officer's actions in stopping the appellant were therefore statutorily authorized by s. 119 of the Highway Traffic Act. Issues Issues The focus of inquiry in this appeal is on the period between the engagement of the police emergency lights and the decision whether or not to give the breathalyzer demand. While the issues in R. v. Bernshaw arose from a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal rejecting the results of an ALERT test when the police officer had not waited for 15 minutes before administering it, the same time period was relevant and the Supreme Court made a number of observations providing useful guidance. The gravamen of the case for the defence was not whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for making the breath demand but whether there was a breach of s. of s.'s Charter because the search only took place following the arbitrary detention of the appellant. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is quashed. 1)The trial judge did not give consideration to the potential application of section 9. It is not necessary to reduce within specific limits the general terms in which the duties of a police officer are expressed. The flexible approach struck the proper balance between Parliament's objective in combatting the evils of drinking and driving and the rights of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The strong police presence in the area helped to prevent the spread of impaired driving. 2)The unreasonable detention and detention suffered by the appellant was demonstrably justified."

The accused had previously applied to a Provincial Court judge, who had declined the accused's application.

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window and with aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused could be convicted of both the charge of mischief and aggravated assault or whether she should have been convicted of one of the lesser and included offences. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court found that the mens rea required for common assault is identical. All that is required is an intent to wound or maim or disfigure. The section pertains to an assault that has the consequences of wounding, maiming or disfiguring the victim. This is simply not believable. The accused is guilty of both offences. The Court of Appeal concluded that the Crown has not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code."

In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed. The matter was remitted to the Commission to be dealt with according to law after the appropriate notices have been given to the applicants. 1)The opinions were not only inadmissible as hearsay but were irrelevant to the present proceedings.  2)The law is well established that the Court in certiorari proceedings is restricted to determining whether or not the inferior statutory tribunal acted within its jurisdiction or there is an error on the face of the record. The evidence adduced at a hearing is not part of the record.  3)The provisions in both the rules of the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority for the conduct of horse racing and the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act clearly entitle the Commission to overturn a decision of the stewards based on the Commission's own assessment of the evidence.

He also made a restitution order in the amount of $24,000. The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The learned judge failed to give proper consideration to the public interest criterion in s. 730(1) of the Code. The sentence imposed did not properly reflect the principle of deterrence or the gravity of the offence. 2) This was a serious fraud accomplished by what the judge called a rather intricate kiting system.","The accused was convicted, after trial, of fraud exceeding five thousand dollars.

Section of the lease provides for increases upon months notice to the tenant. The trial judge found that notice must be given months prior to the expiration of the lease. For the appellant, that notice of a rental increase may be given at any time during a yearly tenancy under the Standard Form Lease.","The tenants entered a standard form lease in 1989. By virtue of its terms, the lease was automatically renewed for a further term of one year from March 1, 1990 provided that neither party gave notice of termination three months prior to the termination date. This was a three percent guideline increase on the base rent which was accepted by the respondents. The appellant offered to permit the respondents to terminate the release on three months notice if they were unhappy with the rental increase. The respondents chose not to exercise this option. The issue was whether the landlord had the right under either the Residential Tenancies Act or the Rent Review Act to unilaterally demand an increase in rent during the term of the lease. The facts were not in dispute. The only restriction in s. 11 of the Act was that the notice of rent increase must come three months before the expiration or possible renewal of the tenancy. The three-month notice requirement was not interpreted as granting the landlord the right to increase the rent in the middle of the term. The Act is intended to protect the tenant from being coerced into giving up his contractual rights. The court allowed the appeal and set aside the decision and recommendation of the Board."
d_1996canlii6756.txt,The plaintiff was to build and supply to the defendants a ready to move home (RTM). The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest. The plaintiff was entitled to interest pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act on the claim for extras to the contract. 4)The claim for the extras was never in dispute. The defendants were entitled to costs of the action.,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the plaintiff was to build and supply a ready to move home (""RTM"") placed on basement. The plaintiff alleged the contract price stipulated in the agreement was in error and commenced rectification of the contract. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for interest was dismissed. The defendant's evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% wasinserted into the document and the nature of the evidence must be clear and convincing. The Court cannot accept the plaintiff'sversion of events.  1) The plaintiff was aware that an RTM does not come with a basement and that a basement is not included in the price quoted. 2) The defendant knew that the plaintiff did not want a price on the RTM and that there was no agreement to pay interest. 3) When further details on the terms of payment of the purchase price were inserted into paragraph 4(d) and (e) at a later date and initialed by Mrs. Batiuk, no interest rate was stipulated. There was no indication in the material that an item for framing of the stairwell to the basement had been priced into the quote, but missed the fact that the price of the basement was 'included in the Agreement'.  4) With respect to costs, while the plaintiff has obtained judgment for the extras, this was never in dispute and was admitted by the defendants in their statement of defence. The real issue was the claim for rectification. The defendants shall be entitled to costs of the procedure."
3_2003skqb532.txt,"The plaintiff employer sought injunctive relief and sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants and to restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any dealings with customers of the plaintiff or pertaining to equipment sold or leased to customers by the plaintiff. HELD: By fiat of December 5, 2003, the Court dismissed the application for injunctive relief with reasons to follow. These are those reasons. 1) The wrongs the plaintiff says it will suffer at the hands of the defendant employees result from the decision of the defendant to expand its business from one dealing with educational supplies, office products and furniture to one involving the supply and service of business machines. The new direction brings the defendants into direct competition with the plaintiff's business. 2) The defendants hired Garry Huntington once his non-competition agreement with the plaintiff expired. The defendants also placed ads in newspapers and hired some 30 employees of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was concerned that the departing employees would take with them confidential information and that it would have difficulty hiring replacements, which would affect its ability to service its clients. 3) The departing employees gave 2 weeks notice. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to more than 2 weeks notice. 4) The affidavit materials filed by the plaintiff provided no evidence of competition or solicitation or imminent danger or threat of such by the defendants. The defendant instructed its employees by memorandum to comply with the plaintiff's requests and guidelines for the duration of their respective notice periods. 5) There was no evidence at all that the defendants induced employees or solicited the plaintiff's clients through them or induced the plaintiff's employees to break any obligations they owed the plaintiff.","Interlocutory injunctions are an extraordinary remedy and thus it is incumbent upon the applicant to demonstrate a prima facie case or even a serious issue to be tried that it was in law entitled to more than two weeks notice or that the respondents were in breach of any right which accrued to Danka. HELD: The application was granted with costs.  1)The applicant complied with the confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of the memorandum.  2)The respondent employees were not prohibited from soliciting, leasing, servicing, distributing or doing business with Danka for the purposes of selling photocopiers, facsimile machines or related multi-function machines. There was no evidence of competition or solicitation by the respondent employees so as to support the quia timet injunction. 3)The injunctive relief taken as a whole seeks to enforce certain restrictive covenants, restrain employees from competitive activity pending the expiration of reasonable notice periods and generally restrain all respondents from any direct or indirect dealings with customers of Danka or pertaining to equipment sold or leased by Danka Canada Inc.  4)Reliance quia tari, 1997 C.L.R. 55 (SCC), [1894] A.C. 541, [1955] T.W.P. 1)It is an important public interest in discouraging restraints on trade, and maintaining a free and open competition unencumbered by the fetters of restrictive clauses. Relief quia time requires the application to establish a strong primae case of imminent danger of substantial damage. Danka accepted the resignations without protest or comment. The submission by the applicant that despite its ejection of the employees from its premises they remained employees is neither surprising nor unusual given the time constraints placed on applicants seeking such relief and the factual nature of the circumstances."
e_2015skqb412.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the request for an assessment was not fair to the defendant and would not be in the interests of justice. The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances. The applicant had not provided any properly supported allegations of misrepresentation, fraud or dereliction of duty by the defendant, whereas there was plenty of evidence that his legal services were effective and appreciated.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court applied for an extension of the 30 day time period provided by s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of all bills for legal services that Brabant and Company Law Office rendered to the applicant within six years of the date of the application. The applicant’s request was not based on a complaint as there was no evidence of overvaluing or undervaluing of the services provided. The length of time between the appointment of a bill and the refusal of the applicant to pay in full was not a concern. The issue was whether the applicant would be prejudiced by the abridgment of time.
8_1990canlii4256.txt,"Where a child's testimony as to repeated acts of sexual assault was not accurate as to precise details of the time and place of the events, but was otherwise reasonable and consistent, the inexactitude did not destroy the child's credibility. Evidence of an expert specializing in recognizing symptoms of child sexual abuse was admissible evidence to assist the trial judge in assessing whether an assault took place. However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","The appellant was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter. The complainant testified that she was home every Friday night with the appellant. She also claimed that he touched her breasts and inside her pants on numerous occasions. After being questioned by her mother, sister, brother and the appellant's girlfriend, the complainant came to her office in a distraught condition. She claimed that the sexual acts took place primarily at her home, usually on Friday nights when her mother was working and her sister had gone to visit her brother and his girlfriend. The trial judge found that the complainant's testimony was consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. He ruled that the evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions that frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of a child, is admissible. Allowing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in allowing such evidence and treating it as relevant to the complainant\'s credibility if, in fact that is what he actually did. The question then is whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of the appellant was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After considering the entire record, it did not occur to the Court that the medical evidence was admissible, not to prove the commission of the offence but as going to the credibility of the complainant."
c_1996canlii5615.txt,"The appellant appealed his sentence of five months in prison to be followed by 18 months probation following his plea of guilty to the theft of his grandmother's car. Crown counsel acknowledged that this type of case would generally attract a suspended sentence with probation but for negative information in the pre-sentence report, which the appellant had not seen prior to sentencing. The appellant argued that he had seen the errors of his ways, was seeking employment, was truly remorseful, and had apologized to his grandparents, who were paying for the appeal in the hope of keeping him out of jail. The appellant was allowed to file affidavits as to the his progress concerning his problems with drugs and alcohol. Per Pugsley, J.A., Flinn, J.A. concurring, allowing the appeal and ordering a suspended sentence subject to terms, that the sentence imposed was not fit, and that it was not in society's interest that the appellant should be removed form his present positive environment. Per Bateman, J.A., dissenting, that the affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were lacking in probative value. It is left, then, to determine the fitness of the sentence at the time it was made. Taking into account the factors before the sentencing judge, the sentence imposed could not be found to be clearly unreasonable.","The appellant pleaded guilty to theft of property of a value exceeding $5,000. He was sentenced to 5 months incarceration, 18 months probation and an 18 month period of probation. He appealed on the grounds the Provincial Court sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the principle of rehabilitation. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentence was clearly unreasonable. The appellant's affidavit evidence failed to show a change in his attitude towards drugs and alcohol since his incarceration. The evidence did not appear to support the appellant's belief that his son had not abused drugs or alcohol while residing with him, nor did it state any further appointment was recommended or scheduled. The negative information contained in the pre-sentence report clearly played a significant part in the disposition of the sentence."

The Agreement provided that neither would claim spousal support.HELD: 1)Credibility was determinative. The wife was articulate, intelligent and forthright while the husband was found to be evasive, argumentative and untruthful in answering a number of questions including the circumstances surrounding the signing of the agreement, the untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario regarding his residency and in applying for default judgment when he knew the petitioner had served an Answer. 2)The agreement was rendered 'void' by the fact the parties cohabited for more than 90 days. 3)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The parties signed a separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement:If the parties cohabited for more than 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose of the cohabitation, the provisions contained in the Agreement will become void. HELD: Counsel proceeded on the basis that the instrument was separation agreement. The Court found the respondent evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions.  1) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave forit; (2) The untrue statements he set out in his divorce petition in Ontario as toidency, statements that he sworeas true in his subsequent application for divorce judgment; (3) His action in applying for a default judgment in the divorce proceedings when he knew the petitioner hadserved his solicitor with her Answer; (4) The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together. The respondent emphasized number of times that his desire was to see the family fully restored and together and that the employment he obtained at Melville, Saskatchewan finally permitted the family to be together in this province.  5) Each of the parties testified and they were the only persons called at the trial. There was no serious argument that they cohabitated in 1997. The only issue was for how long. The petitioner swore that the relationship lasted for ten days in May 1997 and from June 28 1997 until June 30, 1997 and then from June 30 1997 until September 18. If the petitioner's account is accepted, the relationship would have extended for a period of at least 95 days.  6) The respondent was awarded costs of the trial in the amount of $10,000."
9_1999canlii12597.txt,"The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under the Family Maintenance Act which restrains the Attorney General from paying any money owing under an action in Queen's Bench to the respondent and his solicitor and restraining the respondent from disposing of any monies received in the action. The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Family Maintenance Act”) which:a) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the petitioner; and(b) restrorains the respondent from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in relation to the Action. The latter was an application for a restraining order. HELD: The respondent’s personal claim for damages in the Action was the only asset that he had at this time that might give him an ability to satisfy the claim under the Act that was made by the petitioner on behalf of herself and the children.  1) The respondent argued that a preservation of property order is the only one that could reasonably become a source of satisfying a claim under The Act. 2) The only requirement is that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the claim. 3) The court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EEMTA) and found that the sum of $40,000 would likely be sufficient security. The court found that this amount was purely arbitrary and could not be raised or lowered based on the evidence available at the time of this application. The respondent had not met the test set out in s. 10 of The Interpretation Act. It was unlikely that the full amount would be required."

The wife had also brought a separate action suing the husband in contract to enforce this obligation. Application granted; wife's application for retroactive child support struck as 'frivolous'. There was no evidence of the required change in circumstances necessary to support a variation application, there was nothing to enforce in the Corollary Relief Judgment as the  husband had met his obligations under that Order and the agreement he signed to repay the student loans was not binding under the Corollary Relief Judgment as it was not signed by both parties.","The wife brought an application pursuant to Rule 14.25 to strike out the husband's application for retroactive child support. She sought a variation in relation to spousal support and a retroactive order, both designed to cover Melissa's past educational costs. The husband opposed the application and sought consolidation so that one hearing could be held. The wife also sought declaratory relief, exemplary or punitive damages and costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the husband had complied with his child support obligation as set out in the corollary relief judgment and there was nothing to enforce. The only change in circumstances since the application was that the wife had secured several loans to pay for the oldest child's education. The borrower had made no effort to repay these loans and the husband was not seeking to strike the application. There was no evidence that the loan payments were made to the borrower in any capacity other than to repay the loans in the amount of $1400 per month for the child while she was in university and neither the husband nor the wife treated these loans as child support nor as income.

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it. The other affidavits presented uncontradicted evidence of the testator’s undiminished mental capacity.","FIAT: One of the Szwagierczak's five daughters seeks an order directing a trial to prove the 2013 Will in solemn form. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The test in Quaintance is based exclusively on an alleged absence of testamentary capacity. The Court was satisfied that the applicant has not made out a genuine issue for trial. Accordingly, the application must be dismissed.  2) In the circumstances of the deceased’s death, it is pertinent to note that the respondent did not have the capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. There is nothing mysterious about the role of suspicious circumstances in this respect. The presumption simply casts an evidentiary burden on those attacking the will. This burden can be satisfied by adducing or pointing to the evidence."
2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was disabled and had been recipient of income assistance from the Department of Community Services since 2006.

His application was again denied on the failure to provide requested information, this time on the basis that he met the criteria set out in the definition of eligibility. The Board ordered that his assistance be effective the date that he was assessed. The application was granted. The court found that there was a clear legal right established to have the decision of the Appeal Board enforced.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Respondents had sufficient interest under s.6 of The Children's Law Act to seek custody of the child. 2)The trial judge correctly determined that the only issue was the child's best interests, even in a contest between a parent and a stranger, although the parent/child relationship was one factor to be considered. 3)The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. 4)The matter was returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access.","The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her five year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in the home of the appellant and her child were placed with the respondent and the child's mother (M.H.). The child and his mother later married and later married [A.H.] who is the other respondent. The relationship between the parties and she left the care of the respondents in May 1992. The matter was remitted to the Family Court to determine reasonable access. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs and on double Columns on appeal. 1)The trial judge erred in finding the respondent had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status within that Act. 2)The court reviewed the evidence and found there was no evidence protection was needed and no evidence the child was ever put in jeopardy and was not abandoned. As a result the Child and Family Services Act and the contract should govern and if those who sign such contracts to supply custodial and support services are able to obtain custody, their dominating position vis a vis those with disabilities in their care would encourage predatory actions against the less powerful. 3)There was no change in the facts as determined by the trial judge. The trial judge was correct in his statement of the law that his duty was to determine what custodial arrangement was in the best interest of the child. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The parental tie between mother and child is, of course, not to be ignored in such a contest. It is taken into account by the judge when considering the factors outlined in clause (i) of clause (a). 4)The respondent cross-appealed for costs here and below contending the appellant's position had no merit and her case was being pushed forward by others including the Department of Social Services."
4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They are the biological parents of three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and The Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief is dismissed. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner in the interim should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. The respondent has standing in loco parentis to the children. Although there was no opposition to the applicant's request, the deficit is arrived at after factoring in some expenses which perhaps are no longer being incurred, which may have been double counted or for which full consideration ought not to be given. The petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case that the respondent stood in locus parentis vis a vis the parties.  1) Given the short-term relationship and the fact that the parties lived together, there is no question that the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support. 2) The Court has concluded that it is appropriate to order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favor of the petitioner. It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed in locos parentis cases where the applicant has made out a compelling case for entitlement."
b_2000skqb106.txt,"SGI paid $47,427, the minimum death benefit pursuant to s.146(3) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, to the guardian of the three infant children of the deceased single mother. The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident. Accordingly the IRB to be used in s.246(5) should be $94,854. The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The sole issue before the court was whether any additional dependant child care benefits were payable under s. 146(5) of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act when the deceased victim was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The children were not entitled to any additional benefits under the act. The only dependant benefit payable under the Act was the minimum death benefit, which was payable until the date that the surviving spouse died. The deceased was not employed and would not have become entitled to an income within six months if she had survived the accident. As there was no surviving spouse the children were entitled to death benefits. The appeal was dismissed without any order as to costs.S. 147 of the Act does not assist in determining the death benefit. It merely provides that where there are no surviving spouses or where the deceased was, as is the case here, sole parent, and there is more than one dependent child the deceased child death benefit under s146(1) is payable for the youngest child and the remaining children are entitled to the additional benefit."
2_2004skqb498.txt,"FIAT: By fiat of December 5, 2002, Gerein C.J. authorized the initiation of a derivative action by Dale Henry (Henry) on behalf of 609897 Saskatchewan Ltd. (609). By fiat of May 27 2004, the Court ruled that the defendants in the action were entitled to examine for discovery a representative of 609 and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for 609 in the action. In September 2004, clarification of the May 27 2004 fiat was sought. HELD: The questions raised by the parties together with the disparate positions taken by the participants demonstrate the confusion as to the nature of the action and of a party's rights and responsibilities within the action. The action is a derivative one in which the action by plaintiff, 609, proceeds for the benefit of 609 against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. Henry is empowered and obliged to appoint counsel for 609. Such counsel is entitled to have access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action. It follows that Henry and that counsel have professional and fiduciary obligations to 609. Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative action. As no formal motion was brought in this proceeding and the matter proceeded with all parties consenting, there shall be no order as to costs. Henceforth, it is the plaintiff and the defendants, who have status in these proceedings, and not Henry, in his personal capacity, or the board of directors of 609.","FIAT. By fiat of May 27, 2004 the defendants in the action were entitled to examine a representative of 609 for discovery and that Henry was obliged to appoint counsel for the plaintiff. In September 2004 clarification was requested and, with the consent of the plaintiff, Ms. Ouellette for the defendants and Mr. Agnew for the board of directors, the matter proceeded by conference call and written submissions. HELD: 1) It is the plaintiff and the defendants who have status in these proceedings and not Henry in his personal capacity nor the directors of the company in this case. 2) As a corporation, a corporation may only litigate with legal representation, Henry is empowered and obliged to appointed counsel for 609. Whether that counsel is Mr. Brehon, another member of his firm or someone from outside that firm is entirely matter for Henry. Such counsel is entitled to access to the relevant documents, records and employees for the purposes of the action, including preparation of a statement as to documents and following the modified discovery process set out in my earlier fiat. 3) Questions 4 and 5, and the first branch of question are self-evident once one accepts the unity of interest between Henry and 609 which is necessarily reflected in the decision authorizing the derivative action. It follows that Henry's overall instructions to counsel should not be in conflict with the interests of the 609 as Henry is obliged to advance the corporate interests in the derivative act. He was appointed for that purpose and is obligated to so instruct 609's counsel. The issue of costs in prosecuting the action arises because the action remains derivative one in which the action by plaintiff 609 proceeds for the benefit of the respondent corporation against those it alleges to have caused it loss or damage. These concerns still pertain and consequently, without prejudice to renewal of the application for cost reimbursement when the concerns expressed by the Chief Justice can be allayed, the costs in first instance remain with Henry. Questions 7 and 8, and 1 branch of fall to be resolved on the basis of the existing rules of court and the applicable jurisprudence, it not having been yet demonstrated that this aspect of the proceedings warrant modification of the rules."
d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005. The search warrant alleged that the accountant filed fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund, and misreported HST sales. An earlier Information, sworn in April 2005, had been referred to as a prior search warrant. The applicant claimed the information contained incomplete and misleading information and that the learned Justice of the Peace erred in concluding that the necessary grounds existed for the search. In light of his clear statement on cross-examination, the applicant said he would not have pursued a warrant without the information provided by the informant. He also claimed that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias because he had previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) The informant did not say he would have sought the warrant in the absence of the defective paragraphs but only that he would be more comfortable omitting information that he now knows to be erroneous.  2) The nature of the breach of the rules of natural justice is not difficult to understand. Judicially interpreted, the standard is one of credibly based probability. Mere suspicion, conjecture, hypothesis or 'fishing expeditions' fall short of the minimally acceptable standard from both common law and constitutional perspective. Once the allegation of misleading and inaccurate HST reporting is removed, the substance of the Information rests upon the handwritten T4 submitted by the applicant that did not appear to be reconciled with the company payroll. Without denying the potential seriousness of these allegations, they rise above the level of'suspicion' to make out reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his) home."
7_2011nssc184.txt,"Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)). While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter. The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02).","The defendant AGC moved for summary judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not disclose a reasonable cause of action and was clearly unsustainable when read on its own. The AGC also brought a motion for dismissal of the proceeding on the basis that the defendant's claim was not based on a claim of loss of property but on an incorrect claim of seizure and restraint. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff.  1) There is no evidence that the undertaking gives rise to a claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. While it is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the plea. The amendments do not add nothing to the Statement of Claim that was before Justice LeBlanc.  2) The sufficiency of claim does not appear to have arisen from statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. The defendant's undertaking to respond in damages and costs results from the making and the execution of a special warrant and detention order. It does however appear that, once the criminal proceedings were over, the defendant did not seek forfeiture or remedy pursuant to s. 462.32 and 463.32 of the Criminal Code or any remedy with respect to the seized property.  3) It is well settled that the test pursuant to Rule 14.25(1)(a) is that the application will not be granted unless the action is “obviously unsustainable.” In considering an application to strike a pleading it is not the court's function to try the issues but rather to decide if there are issues to be tried. The power to strike out pleadings is to be used sparingly and where the action raises substantial issues it should not be struck out."

The Supreme Court upheld the decision. The appellants appealed.

The Crown and the defence put forward a joint sentencing recommendation of two years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud, which was all that the appellants had actually retained. The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount as submitted in the joint recommendation. The Crown and the paymaster agreed to a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation with restitution in the full amount rather than one half of the sum as submitted by the joint report. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appealed the judge's decision to order restitution of the full sum rather than half of what was submitted in both the joint recommendations. Allowing the appeal, that the submissions made to the judge on sentence were the culmination of a process of plea negotiation. While the agreement reached between counsel was, of course, not binding on the judge, the judge made the recommendation based on, among other things, the fact that they had been required to give the other half to them.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PCS) for breach of contract whereby the plaintiff was to supply electricians to perform work at its potash mine at Rocanville, Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $500. The defendant is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is to pay costs against Sullivan. 1) The law is well settled that an employee is under an implied obligation not to compete with an employer during the term of his or her employment. Although the defendant had given notice that he would no longer work for the plaintiff after September 30th, he was still employed at the time he submitted his proposal. The claim against PCS is dismissed. 2) The trial judge erred in fact in characterizing the plaintiff's actions as mere preparation. The plaintiff competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's. Her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. There is nothing that Restauronics can complain of in this case."

In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief.

In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant. Secondly, the issue of delays in litigation is important and the case will present an opportunity for the Court to clarify the legal framework pertaining to such matters.","The applicants are defendants in an action commenced by the respondent University of Saskatchewan. They applied to have the University's claim against them dismissed for want of prosecution but were unsuccessful. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the delay from 1991 to 1998 (when the university's insurer was prosecuting the action) was not problematic. However, the reason for the delay was because the university had not obtained an appointment for the examination for discovery until 1997. As result, the university did not assume control of the action in issue here until 1998. The issue of merits was found to be well known and there was enough merit in their position to warrant granting leave."

The respondent seeks an order that his child support obligations for their child ended July 2004 because their child ceased to be a person within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from his mother's charge. HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old.

On the basis of the respondent’s income, the amount of child support was reduced to $181 per month, and the respondent had abandoned his claim for retroactive support and retroactive s. expenses."

The defendant and three others had set out to check a tuna pen. The boat was owned by a fourth individual, who was not present at the time. One of the men, despite having no experience diving with scuba equipment and being advised against it by the others, insisted on diving to check the pen. He died of drowning due to inexperienced scuba diving. Defendant not guilty of the offence charged; the defendant was not the deceased's employer. All four individuals thought of themselves as self-employed fishermen and had a profit-sharing agreement; the evidence did not establish that the defendant was acting as skipper or captain in the owner's absence; the defendant was not operating the vessel and the evidence did not show that the defendant had any kind of authority over the other fishers. The deceased was dependant on the boat's owner for the boat and part of the gear, for another individual for the licence and on the defendant for the balance of the gear; the relationship was closer to that of independent contractor than that of employer-employee.","The defendant was charged under s.13(1)(a) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act with failing to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. The deceased was a self-employed fisherman who, despite having never done so before, was required to perform duties mainly for the defendant and was in a relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of an independent contractor. The defendants were recruited by the defendant to fish with him and the defendant. HELD: The defendant was not guilty of the offence charged. If the legislature means to include fishers as employers or employees under this Act, it should do so specifically and inform the industry in advance of that change in policy. The defendant is not the same person as a 'dependent contractor' for the purposes of this Act."
c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt.","The petitioner sought a distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. The parties lived on an acreage and rented farm land. They carried on a mixed farming operation. The respondent did the farm work with the petitioner providing assistance. An appraisal of the farm land and out buildings was done and the report filed. Absent any evidence to the contrary, the respondent's testimony was accepted. HELD: 1) The farm machinery comprises major portion of the family property. Over the years the respondent has owned several machines and this began before the marriage. The petitioner has received no benefit from these expenses. For example, she received no income from the farm since the separation. Therefore, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made. 2) The debts submitted by the respondent which believe should be taken into account are those of $856.00 plus $1,000 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. 3) The respondent sold his trailer and the sale proceeds of $12,000 were used to purchase the acreage. There is a serious dispute in respect to what pieces of machinery constitute family property; what exemptions are available to the respondent; and what value should be attributed to the equipment which is subject to distribution. These debts were referred to three appraisals; one done at the behest of the petitioner and two at the respondent, with the sole purpose of fixing the value of the machinery at $800. 4) The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent in the sum of $51,725.82 together with taxable costs of the action."
d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted. There was an arguable issue with respect to the chambers judge’s conclusions that the appellant had stopped paying the household expenses, the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support, and the quantum of the support. If the order was enforced, the appellant would be prejudiced. The respondent’s means were limited and there was a real prospect that she would be unable to repay any overpayment of spousal support.","The appellant applies for an order staying execution of a spousal support order that provided ongoing support for the appellant's wife, the respondent in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave the respondent exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support of $2,726 per month. The appellant argues that the Chambers judge's conclusion that he stopped paying the bills for the family house at the end of October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. HELD: The application to lift the stay of proceeding is allowed. It is not directed to stay proceedings. The judge has the power to give directions with respect to staying proceedings."
7_1990canlii4117.txt,"Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage, interim maintenance in the amount of $100 per month was ordered ,  having regard to the means, needs and circumstances of each spouse.","The parties were married fifteen years. There were no children. The petitioner wished to upgrade herself so she could obtain a degree in Accounting. She received $17,683 as her share of an equal division upon the sale of the matrimonial home. She was looking to replace a motor vehicle which had stopped working and was too costly to repair. She resided with relatives. She now sought maintenance on an interim basis. The respondent denied this application. Allowing the application and awarding the sum of $100 to the petitioner, that while this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly maintenance being made at the hearing of the divorce, it was appropriate to award the sum because there was a causal relationship between the petitioner's attempts to become pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage."
8_2002skqb144.txt,"FIAT. After a decree nisi of foreclosure had issued but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners (the former husband) applied for judicial sale of the matrimonial home. The joint owners separated in 1999 and are involved in an acrimonious family law court action. The wife has exclusive possession of the property. The Credit Union as first mortgagee opposed the application. The co-owner did not participate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)This is not the proper forum to attempt to affect a family property settlement. The husband was not entitled in these proceedings to a possession order. The wife prevented every attempt to show the property to prospective owners. There was no reason to assume she will be any more cooperative with a court appointed realtor. The Credit Union did not request immediate possession. 2)The court's entitlement to order a judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The court reviewed the history of the statutory authority for a judicial sale in a mortgage foreclosure proceedings. The 1852 Chancery Procedure Amendment Act was repealed in 1881 and replaced by Ordinance 51, Rule 1, which became law in the NWT by virtue of the Judicature Ordinance No.6 of 1893. It is now found in s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act in its modified form. Deciding whether it is 'necessary or expedient' within the meaning of s.70 of the Queen's Bench Act is, however, a judicial exercise.","After a decree nisi of foreclosure issued, but before expiration of the redemption period, one of the defendant registered owners applied for judicial sale of the mortgaged property, being the matrimonial home. The relief sought was for an order that the property be listed with a private realtor for fixed time at an upset (listing) price of $120,000. The mortgagee, Border Credit Union, opposed the application and did not participate in the hearing. The defendant had no further interest in the property and was not served with the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court's entitlement to order judicial sale at any stage of foreclosure proceedings before a final decree issues is no longer questionable. The property had been listed for sale by the applicant in February 2002 and the listing agent believed that it could be sold in four to six weeks for between $124,000 and $125,000 if shown to prospective buyers. There was a modest surplus accruing to the registered owners."
b_1994canlii5130.txt,"The City applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the Defendant Unions from engaging in unlawful picketing. The City alleged that the members of the Defendant Unions obstructed and/or blocked entrances to and/or exits from various premises of the plaintiff including, inter alia, its Electrical Distribution Department, its Water and Pollution Control Department and its Water Treatment Plant thereby interfering with the plaintiff's statutory and contractual obligations to provide essential services to its citizens and others, and, as well, created a danger to the health and safety of its said citizens and others. The Defendant Unions did not file any materials. HELD: Application allowed. On the whole of the evidence the court was satisfied that the applicant had raised a substantial question to be tried, had established a prima facie case, was in danger of suffering injury which could not adequately be compensated for by the award of damages in money, and that the balance of convenience in the matter favoured the applicant.","At the conclusion of the hearing, the applicant applied for an interim injunction until trial or until further order on certain terms and conditions. HELD: The application was granted. There was a prima facie case of the violation by the defendants of a right or rights that the applicant might have. The applicant has shown more than the mere prospect orapprehension of injury that the defendants may have been enacting that which the applicant alleges is in violation of its rights. The plaintiff is suffering in consequencethereof and that such suffering cannot be adequatelycompensated for by the award of damages in money. The balance of convenience in this matter favoured the applicant. The application for an injunction was granted until trial."
2_2007skca63.txt,"The respondent was convicted of having in his possession a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and was sentenced to a term of incarceration of 9 months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The issues on appeal were: 1) the length of the sentence; and 2) the refusal of the sentencing judge to order forfeiture of the truck used by the respondent to bring the drugs into Saskatchewan and to deliver them. The sentencing judge found the truck was not 'integral to the offence.' HELD: The Crown is granted leave to appeal. 1) The appeal against the length of sentence is dismissed. 2) The appeal of the failure to order forfeiture of the truck is allowed. The truck is ordered forfeited. 1) Although the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range, in these circumstances, there is no basis for interfering with it.  2) Upon conviction, the first step the trial judge ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the CDSA. It is clear the truck is 'offence-related property' in that it was used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence. The sentencing judge failed to consider the definition in the CDSA. Section 19 of the CDSA allows innocent parties who have a valid interest in property to apply for an order of restoration. However, the innocent party must be either the lawful owner or lawfully entitled to possession of the property which would otherwise be forfeited. The Court may order in its discretion that the property be returned to the innocent person. In this case, the vehicle was owned by the respondent and the parents are not lawfully entitled to its possession. The sentencing judge had no discretion but was required to order forfeiture and erred in failing to do so. He further erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property.","The respondent, resident of Manitoba, was convicted of having in his possession controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was sentenced to nine months with a 10 year firearms prohibition. The offence took place in Yorkton. The sentencing judge refused to order forfeiture of the truck, which was owned by the respondent and paid for through a loan from his parents. The trial judge found that 'basically all of the money' to pay for the truck came from the parents' bank account but they had registered no lien to protect their interests. The father was depressed and remorseful. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and the truck was ordered forfeited. 1) The Court found that the sentence imposed was at the very low end of the range but there was no basis for interfering with the sentence.  2) It is clear the truck is used in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence and the Crown put a street value of between $2000 and $2000 with the respondent valuing the drugs at slightly under $2000. Upon conviction, the first step he ought to have taken was to determine whether the property was 'offence-related property' within the meaning of the Act. In the case of forfeiture the Court may take into account the impact that an order of forfeiture may have on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling house was the member's principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence, and if the member is innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence (s. 19.1(4)). The Court may order forfeiture in its discretion that the truck be returned to the innocent person. 3) There is no reference to proportionality in the Act and it is only in regard to forfeiture of real property that the judge can take into consideration the impact of forfeiture on a person of a certain age, who has no prior record, or who acquired title to or right of possession of the property from person referred to in paragraph (a) under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the title or right was transferred for a purpose of avoiding forfeiture. The truck was integral in transporting the respondent to various places across the country. The Court erred in considering proportionality as a factor to be considered when dealing with the forfeiture of personal property."
2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) upheld the appellant's claim for gradual onset stress. The appellant appealed on the basis that the tribunal failed to take into account the worker's subjective view of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. Appeal dismissed; there is no dispute about the standard by which we should review these questions on appeal. The question of whether the policy applied the correct legal test is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard; how it applied the test in light of the evidence; whether the Policy was wrong to apply it unreasonably to the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The policy is correct. It was not necessary to rely on the standard set out in the GECA nor did it require an objective assessment of workplace events or stressors. The objective view relates to the assessment of the nature of the events which the worker claims gave rise to the stressors, either because they fall within the express statutory inclusions (i.e., 'a wilful and intentional act' or 'a fortuitous event occasioned by a physical or natural cause') or because they should be included by judicial interpretation. 2) Before the Policy 1.3.6 was adopted, there was some inconsistency within the appellant concerning whether an objective or subjective approach should be taken to assessing the workplace stressors in the workplace. WCAT failed to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of any evidence to rebut that opinion. The Court reviewed the record and found that the policy is declaratory of the principles to be applied in the context of GECA. 3) The appellant was not challenging the appeal."

When the defendant notified the plaintiff that it was going to cancel the policy, the plaintiff placed a second policy on the property. The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

The defendant, Canada Trustco, had placed two policies of insurance for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff against one insured company for non-payment of the insurance premium. The plaintiff failed to disclose the existence of the second policy. The insurance policy was placed with the Co-operators General Insurance Company and protected both the plaintiff's interests and the mortgagee. The Court found that in the context of the contract between the insurance companies, the standard of proof was still on balance of probabilities but on a higher degree of probability, commensurate with the conduct alleged.

d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a). Given that the defendant's vehicle was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building, the parking brake was engaged, the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running, the court concluded that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally or of it becoming a danger to the public.",The accused was charged with driving while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood. The accused was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat. He did not intend to drive the vehicle. There were other factors that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind. The Crown had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the relevant time.
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case. The information conveyed is nothing more than the opinion of the authors based on hearsay, namely information obtained by third parties, the only one identified is Ms. Tindall. One is left wondering why no one sought to obtain an affidavit from her. 4) Hearsay matters in the father's affidavits should not have been considered. The report were not sworn or verified under oath.  Thus Rule 603(3) does not apply to them, and to the extent that they were based on hearsay, they should not have been considered. Without the hearsay evidence, there was no case for even the direction of a trial of the issue, let alone an order in favour of the father.","The appellant appealed an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. The father paid some maintenance for the child and had extensive access to the child, she spending most of the time with her maternal grandparents. He alleged that the mother was an alcoholic and as a result did not properly care for the children. The mother filed an affidavit denying all of the allegations, and in particular, that she was the alcoholic and that her alcoholism adversely affected the child. She also filed affidavits from three friends and the 16 year old daughter to support her own evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed. Even assuming that the Investigation Record was adduced into evidence by reason of reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, with viva voce evidence, there was no case for even direction of the trial of an issue, let alone an order in favour of the father. Even if the hearsay evidence were admissible, given the direct denial under oath by the mother of either either alcoholism or lack of proper care of the child there should have been an order directing a trial rather than a decision made on the written evidence filed: Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 309.

Leave to appeal was granted with respect to whether the Committee erred in making an order respecting issues not raised by the notice of intention to appeal; in ruling the assessed value cannot be increased where the board orders correction of errors in the assessment; if not, whether the Committee erred in jurisdiction in failing to apply s.263.2 of the Urban Municipality Act.

The Committee concluded that the Board had erred, having no jurisdiction as the matter had unfolded, to make an increase, and it restored the original value.

The officer dialed the number for Legal Aid duty counsel for the accused and the accused spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel prior to providing breath samples of 190 milligrams and 180 milligrams. The accused never indicated that he wished to contact other counsel. HELD: Following a voir dire, the accused's application to exclude evidence was dismissed. The accused had not succeeded in establishing on a balance of probabilities that the accused's right to consult counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been violated. The accused was entirely disinterested in consulting with counsel as was his right and was clear and unequivocal in his waiver of rights to counsel.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss253(b) and 255(1), and driving while disqualified contrary so s259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2 in the Information. 1) The Court was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within 2 hours of the accident. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did there be tailoring of the evidence. 2) There must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. 3) The trial judge may consider reliance on the presumption in s. 258.(1)(c) in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness notwithstanding the conduct complained of. The conversation was apparently about the width of the boulevard in the intersection. The skid marks were about 50 to 60 feet long. The accused's vehicle was pushed into the intersection by the impact of the collision and he was struck by the vehicle. He suffered serious injuries to his back and required hospitalization."
c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord. Application for summary judgment granted. The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant.","The Trustee in bankruptcy received a voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 9, 2005. The Trustee was appointed as trustee of the premises. When the Trustee attended the premises, it was found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession. A consent order was granted directing that the trustee would take possession of the assets which have given rise to the action for the purposes of completing an inventory and liquidating the assets in accordance with the normal duties and powers of the trustee. The trustee was awarded reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the property. The application for summary judgment was continued.

b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial. No reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of the trial judge's decision to proceed in relation to the first three counts in the information.","The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident.

In dealing with count 4, the trial judge learned only of the Crown's allegation that the appellant had driven while disqualified pursuant to ss. 253 and 254 of the Code. He also held that he would not be improper for the judge to preside over the trial on the impaired driving, refusal and obstruction charges. The trial judge in this case did not grant the application to sever the count as being nullity. It was remitted back to trial judge. 1) The Court of Appeal did not give the appellant's reason for not responding sooner to the severing of the count. It is inevitable that the judicial record will play a role in the decision making process. However, no reasonable apprehension of bias arose by virtue of this trial judge's decision. 2) There is no normalcy of bias in the criminal justice system as a result of the convictions of mere mortals. It does not rise to the level of a normal judicial process. 3) The test for apprehension of biases in criminal law is well settled. The leading case is R. v. S.(R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 484, 151 D.L.R.(4th) 193.

The decision of the Provincial Court judge was not automatically automatic."
c_1997canlii1639.txt,"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff went on maternity leave for six months. During this time the defendant, her employer, hired a temporary replacement on a part-time basis, with fewer hours and less pay than the plaintiff. The defendant offered this position to the plaintiff when her leave had ended. She refused, and alleged constructive dismissal without cause. She admitted that the defendant had asked her prior to her leave if her job could be done in less hours, and that she said it might be possible. The defendant alleged that this should have made it clear to the plaintiff that her position was being changed from full-time to permanent part-time, and constituted reasonable notice. Awarding the plaintiff eight month's notice, that the proposed changes to the job fundamentally altered the employment contract without giving the plaintiff reasonable actual notice. This was therefore a constructive dismissal without cause.","This was an action for damages for wrongful dismissal where the plaintiff contends that she was constructively dismissed without notice by her employer, the defendant. The issues were whether there was constructive dismissal, at what point did the plaintiff have notice of the changes which constituted constructive dismissal? HELD: The appropriate period of notice was 8 months. The plaintiff was awarded damages on the basis of eight months salary at the rate she was receiving at the time of her employment, plus vacation pay of 6% per annum and interest from July 14th to September 14th 1997. 1)It is of course an essential ingredient of constructive dismissal that the employee have absolutely failed to militage. 2)In this case the plaintiff was not only wrongfully dismissed but her employment was terminated. 3)The employer bore the responsibility of clearly informing the employee of proposed changes in the employment contract. The fact that Maternity Leave is provided under the Employment Insurance Act for employed mothers is designed to provide employed mothers an opportunity to give to the new born the total care that is required in order for the child to have a good start in life. In this case, the employer put such a proposition to an employee of the obvious high calibre of the plaintiff with a proven track record with her employer. It is also significant that the four months of maternity leave was not deducted froth her period of employment when her vacation pay benefit was increased to six percent after five years of employment. 4)The plaintiff had no notice of these changes until the letter of June 1997, which put in process events which led to the constructive dismissal as of July 14. 1997. She was, therefore, wrongfully dismissé."
6_2012skqb275.txt,"The parties agree that joint custody is appropriate, but the petitioner mother asked that the principal residence of the two boys be varied and awarded to her. The parties live blocks from each other, but the transition between homes has not gone well. The children have been primarily residing with the father. The father has been in three motor vehicle accidents within three years and is facing criminal charges as a result of the most recent one. The father works long hours as a maintenance man. The mother has four other children from previous relationships. The children of the marriage indicate that they have some problems with one step brother, who lives in their mother's home. The children's academic performance is not strong and the parents have made little effort to assist their children in pursuing an education. One child has been non- compliant with his ADHD medication while in the father's care. While the mother has a more stable residence, both parties have bounced from home to home. The father has tended to abdicate parenting responsibilities to his relatives and has not used the mother as a caregiver of first resort. The mother's relationship with her children has not been fostered in a meaningful way. HELD: While there is no ideal solution, the Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement where the children would spend one week in each home when school started in the fall. The parents were required to participate in mediation sessions which were to be paid for by the father. Joint custody was ordered. The father was ordered to pay child support in accordance with the Guidelines.","The parents of two young boys, nine and 11, require a framework for parenting. Joint custody is not opposed. The father has had primary residence by interim order but that arrangement has been fraught with difficulty for reasons which will be explored. The mother, Sherri, asks that the boys' principal residence be varied and awarded to her. HELD: 1) The best interests test governs the determination on the issue of primary residence. Although the father is 34 years of age and has four older children of other relationships, the Court has found him not entitled to the child tax credit, child support paid by the father of the two children and the Child Tax benefits and employment supplement are the only sources of income for the father. He has abdicated a significant chunk of his caregiving role to his mother and sisters. His unfortunate injuries in the motor vehicle accident did not inspire him to adopt a spirit of compromise. He is currently receiving income replacement benefits from SGI based on 90% of his income. Although he has bounced from home to home, the father has been non-ambulatory and heavily dependent on others. The Court found him to be negligent in many parenting aspects, offsetting by his efforts to communicate with teachers and to have the home environment proposed to be provided for the children. There are red flags."
b_2016skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made in 2005. The court assumed that the imputation was correct. The respondent had not shown a material change required to vary the obligation nor had he met the onus to justify the need for a change to the amount of child support payable for the years 2005 to 2012. From January 2016, the respondent was ordered to pay child support for one child based upon his current income ; and 2) the respondent had not provided any meaningful financial support for his children for the entire period despite the fact that enforcement steps had been taken by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. The court determined that the respondent had the ability to pay the arrears and it would not expunge them. The arrears from 2013 to date would be adjusted to accord with the respondent’s current income.","The respondent applies for an order to discontinue his obligation to pay child support and spousal support and for all support arrears to be expunged. He relies upon s. 17 of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, and s. 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1) The original order was correct. The matter did not proceed beyond the interim stage. Rather, from April 2005 through to the present, the respondent has been content to have the existing order in place and did not seek to challenge it by way of trial proceedings to obtain a final order different from that pronounced by McIntyre J. 2) The respondent is able to establish he has been working full-time employment for the past four years. In those years, he earned actual income from full time position. There is little doubt it will be onerous for him but then, on the other hand, he has avoided paying anything for considerable period of time. In the result, am not prepared to expunge any of the arreears prior to 2013. 3) The Court must consider whether the original Order was correct at the time it was made. The present income is $88,808.88 per annum. This is a consistent income for several years. The respondent elected not to challenge the imputation of income made 10 years ago. It is not complete answer to the determination of an appropriate historical income for the respondent. The obligation does not lie on the petitioner to show why the imputed income is still appropriate. The onus rests squarely on the respondent to justify the need for change. He must present evidence of changed circumstances which establish that either a) it is no longer necessary or appropriate to impute income, (i.e. that he is unable to continue with the manufacture of the invention, and (ii) he is unlikely to be able to continue to earn consistent income in the future. While there is nothing to explain what has changed, the onus lies with the respondent, who is prepared to pay his proportionate share of post-secondary education costs. It appears he was not able to find employment in his chosen field, because he was working, and because he had avoided providing any meaningful financial support to his children and former spouse for the entire time the order has been in place."

Appeal dismissed; in every case where fraud has been found, the insurer has relied in its factum on the statutory conditions as basis for its claim; the failure of the appellant to advise her sister of the possibility that the Nicholsons arranged the fire does not constitute fraud or wilful false statement; the insurer must make full disclosure of the circumstances of the case."
7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. She had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At very early stage of the trial, defence counsel was aware that the information was in the possession of the Crown and therefore, aware that it could be used to impeach the accused's testimony and contradict things she had told to Sergeant Kelly in her video taped statement. The accused sought and was granted a continuance of the publication ban on the 'newly discovered evidence' after a mistrial. The Crown appealed the decision. HELD: The accused has succeeded in proving a breach of her right to make full answer and defence. A mistrial was ordered. The evidence goes to the mens rea element of the offences alleged against the accused and goes directly to the issue of her credibility. There was no suggestion that Crown disclosure was incomplete. The Court was satisfied that the accused had made significant strategic decisions regarding her re-election, including not re-electing a judge by mistake and making sure that any motion to dismiss was made before trial was made. However, the Court was not satisfied that Crown counsel had no prior knowledge of this evidence and that until last week, neither did the immediate investigative team. Counsel acted quickly and appropriately when he learned of the new evidence. This is an important case because it could lead to the establishment of a new criminal statute. It is not enough to show non-disclosure; rather actual prejudice must also be demonstrated."

The appellant applied to adduce fresh evidence consisting of a letter from the Investigating Committee describing how it intended to proceed. The appellant argued the matter was disciplinary, not academic, and as it can ultimately result in his dismissal, he is entitled to procedural fairness, including a fair hearing, the right to cross-examination of witnesses, to call his own witnesses, to active legal representation and to full disclosure. He argued all committee members, except the union representative, should be excluded by reason of bias.

The issue of whether the proceedings were academic or disciplinary was not raised until the application below. 4)The application was premature as there are other avenues of appeal provided in the regulations.

c_1998canlii13762.txt,"The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s27 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell them the lands which were subject to their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant objected on the basis the plaintiff did not meet the time frame requirements set out in s27(2)(b) as an unconditional and unequivocal letter of committment to finance the purchase had not been issued by the Farm Credit Corporation. The defendant counterclaimed for rent owing by the plaintiffs as overholding tenants. HELD: A declaration issued that the plaintiffs had complied with s27 of the Farm Security Act in exercising their right of first refusal and the defendant was to forthwith transfer the land to the plaintiffs for $629,280 on the usual trust conditions. The defendants' counterclaim was dismissed. 1)The defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with the legislation. Prior to the May letter the plaintiffs had complied with the original obligation to provide a letter of committment from a recognized financial institution. The request for a letter addressed to it from a financial institution was first made in May 1997 and was an attempt to unilaterally change the initial requirement imposed on the plaintiffs. 2)Both the wording of s27(2)(b)(ii) and the wording used by the defendant in its offer of first refusal refer to a letter of committment to finance. A letter of credit binding the financial institution to advance the money in any event would be beyond the means of most farmers who had recently experienced difficult financial circumstances. To interpret the letter of committment referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage financing would eliminate the ability of most farmers to exercise the right of first refusal. There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they havecomplied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs had not validly exercised their right to first refusal. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in the Act which require an unconditional and unequivocal letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance the purchase of the land. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs asover holding tenants. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs of the action. 1) Mortgage financing is always subject to terms which for the most part are routine and well understood. The terms of mortgage financing will always require certain things be performed before money will be advanced. Neither the legislation, nor the defendant's offer to the plaintiffs required unconditional terms of financing. Rather what both required was an unconditional commitment to finance. The legislation was not complied with. 2) The loan approval issued by the defendant was not an unconditional or unequivocal commitment. 3) The plaintiffs had complied with the original contractual obligation to provide a letter of guarantee from the defendant. The Farm Credit Corporation loan approval had been faxed to them on April 30, 1997. The Loan Approval was not Unequivocal and Unconditional. 4) The plaintiff did not have the benefit of full argument on the point. 5) The Court did not consider its remarks binding on the plaintiff."

The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There has been a marriage breakdown and the divorce is granted. The parties have two children, a son born January 1989 and a daughter September 1988. The respondent seeks equal parental control and responsibility by an order for joint custody under s.16(4) of the Divorce Act. The mother seeks to be the final decision maker in matters relating to the children's welfare, growth and development while being prepared to promote maximum contact between the children and their father to the extent that this is consistent with the best interests of the children.

The children have had the benefit of one constant, outside the home, sitter, whom the father has designated as their guardian during the weeks they are with him. This pattern so early on does not fair well for a continued joint custodial arrangement. To date it has not been the 'occasional resort' to the court referred to in Krugger v.

1997canlii1932.txt,"The plaintiff's leg was impaled for 25 minutes on an iron fence which he had attempted to climb for. He was treated at the emergency department of the Victoria General Hospital for an hour. He did not inform the doctors as to the length of time he had been impaled. Upon his release he was advised to watch for any infection. He was not issued antibiotics. The wound quickly worsened, and the plaintiff was forced to undergo surgery and a skin graft to repair his leg. He sued the doctors who initially treated him for negligence. Dismissing the action, that the subsequent infection was caused by the injury itself and nothing done by the defendants contributed to it in any way. While the defendants underestimated the nature and extent of the injury, they provided a recognized method of treatment based upon the knowledge they had. The real fault lies with the plaintiff who failed to reveal fully what had happened to him.","The plaintiff alleged negligence by the two defendants medical doctors and alleged damages arising from the negligence of the doctors. He suffered a puncture/tear wound received while climbing an iron fence. He was impaled on a picket fence for half an hour. Emergency Department staff did not attend to treat the plaintiff as he was hanging upside down on the fence. At the hospital, he was assessed by an emergency room specialist. He claimed to have been impaled for approximately 25 minutes. No mention was made of the puncture wound, the treatment of which was appropriate and within the standard of care expected of an emergency medicine specialist. The plaintiff's disability was mild and he did not appear to be in shock. The medical examiners' notes indicated an extremely low temperature, moderate blood pressure, and a high blood pressure. None of these findings was accepted by the plaintiff's medical experts. In assessing damages, the court found that the defendants and each of them did not fall below the standards of care required of them in their treatment of the plaintiff. Further, the plaintiffs loss is not attributable to any of the acts of the defendants but rather is the direct result of the injury he suffered."
2_2000skqb111.txt,"The plaintiff claimed damages for failure to perform as agreed in constructing a residence. Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D&S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The claim was dismissed with the result that the plaintiff was only entitled to $4,000 for extras he had ordered.  1)Cost of Performance was to be valued on the basis of cost of performance (of bringing the house up to the standard originally intended) and not in the diminution in value of the building (the difference between the commercial value of a plant as built and as it ought to have been built). 2)The Court found that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant who admitted to the fact that the house was sold in 1997 and that he did not have any prior knowledge of the round pillars. The Court awarded the sum of $5,900 to the plaintiff and $1,000,000 to the corporate defendant. 3)Although the defendant denied any knowledge of round pillars prior to June 1994, he was aware that they were part of a construction project. He was struck by two things which were a part of his home: the pillars and the roof. It did not seem likely that he would then speak with his contractor about only the one. The plaintiff was obtaining advice from Slater from time to time and it makes sense he would speak to him about both the pillar and roof before speaking with Mr. Wist. It does not make sense to attribute the cost of the pillar or roof to any other person but rather to the defendant."
9_2003skqb229.txt,"An appeal of conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.255 and s.253) on the grounds of misdirection in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt as to impairment; an incorrect inference and failure to give correct legal effect to the facts as found including the lack of evidence of impairment at the material time while he was in care or control of the vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence. Findings of fact concerning the essential elements of care and control and impairment were supported by the evidence. The law outlined Shuparski and authorities cited within were properly applied when determining the appellant had care and control.  2)Stellato was correctly applied along with the tests and observations outlined in Landes and Hall in concluding his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. 3)While Burdett reflects the current state of the law governing circumstantial evidence, it remains subject to the rule in Hodge's case (1838). However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba). A properly instructed jury could have arrived at the same inference on the facts as found.","The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving. The trial judge misdirected herself in finding there was sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The learned trial judge drew an incorrect inference from the facts at trial in finding the appellant had care or control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The inference made by the trial judge was one that a properly instructed jury could have arrived at on the facts in the instant case and therefore should not be interfered with. To the extent the Crown relied on the presumption afforded by s. 258 of the Criminal Code, the rebuttal evidence led by the appellant failed to rebut the same."
6_2004skca168.txt,The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) No error was demonstrated. 2) This Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature.,"The appellant appeals from an order of Ryan-Froslie J., which directed that the daughter of the parties, shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the seven week period before trial. The application for variation does not relate to a final order but rather an interim one. Counsel for both parties acknowledged in argument that joint custody with an equal sharing of time should continue pending trial. As such, there is no need to vary the interim order. The real issue is where the child will attend kindergarten. As indicated above, this matter will be proceeding to trial within the next three to four months. Subject to the parties reaching a different agreement, there shall be an order that the child continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December 2004. The respondent's motion under Rule 15 is now moot. Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs on double Col. 5. While the court signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature, it does not constitute reversible error. In Foss v. Foss (1991), 1991 CanLII 7937 (SK CA), 31 R.F.L. (3d) 367 (Sask. C.A.), which reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion, this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed."
d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively. Neither made any provision for the younger child. The executors were directed to hold the farmlands and improvements in trust for him until he attains the age of twenty-one years. The residue was subject to sale in the Executor's absolute discretion with the like discretion to apply the net income and to encroach on capital for the maintenance of the child until he reaches the ripe old age. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the estate to be paid out of the Estate. 1)There was nothing within the will, read as a wholewith reference to the ordinary rules of construction, whichrequires the term 'personal effects' to be given anythingother than its ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the Testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. 2)The amount to be awarded for maintenance was not tied to the standard of living the children experienced during their lifetime, or to their net income. The children's needs were such that they required the monies sooner rather than later.  3)The deceased left an estate of $285,067.68. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and there would be a reserves remaining for unknown contingencies and undetermined costs and expenses. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances, while still giving effect to the testator's intentions to preserve the farmland in specie for conveyance to the children at age twenty years."
8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of s. 26(a) of the Saskatchewan Fisheries Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan. The Crown argued that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove anything with respect to commercial fishing in order to make out all the charges against their clients. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by failing to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and an Aboriginal rights defence. Commercial fishing is not an issue in this case. It was the Crown's position that the respondents were in fact commercial fishermen and that they would have sold some of the fish if they had caught any in their nets. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 3, 4 and 5 but for the constitutional defence which he found to be established. It is the case that the Crown established commercial fishing was the issue."

The offer was not accepted and the matter proceeded to trial. A week after the trial was concluded and while the decision was reserved, the offer was revoked. The petitioner applies for costs against the respondent pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184B. HELD: Queen's Bench Rule 184B calls for double costs from the date of service of the offer. The fact the offer was revoked does not alter the concept in Rule 184B and the resulting sanction. The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3 up to September 14, 2010 and double party of party costs under Column 3 thereafter, together with the costs for this application. All costs were payable forthwith.","The petitioner served the respondent with a formal offer of settlement on September 14, 2010. The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial. About a week after the conclusion of the trial, the petitioner revoked his offer. HELD: The petitioner was awarded party to party costs under Column 3. 1)The purpose of making formal offers to settle pursuant to the Queen's Bench Rules of Court is obvious. The issues that were litigated were a substantial and merited trial. 2)The sanction so to speak of not accepting a reasonable offer properly tendered and proceeding to trial was found in Rule 184B of the Queen’s Bench Rules and the Rule of 545 which calls for double costs from the date of service."
1990canlii4096.txt,"This was an application for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings against the applicant, in particular restraining a sentencing hearing, in respect of charges of professional misconduct. The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The Appeal Court had refused to issue an interim injunction restraining the disciplinary hearing, holding that the courts should not interfere with the tribunal's proceedings until its completion except in very exceptional circumstances. In the case at hand, the applicant's counsel had requested an adjournment of the sentencing hearing on the ground that the applicant was medically unable to attend. The respondent's counsel then sought to settle the matter of penalty by written submission. The respondent's by-laws respecting penalty provided that the applicant shall be given the opportunity to appear and be heard. Dismissing the application for an interim injunction, that because the sentencing hearing was merely an extension of the disciplinary proceedings, rather than a new proceeding, the court was bound by the Appeal Court decision which held that the Court should not interfere with the proceedings of a quasi-judicial or other tribunal by interim injunction or stay except in very exceptional circumstances, which requirement, the Appeal Court had concluded, the applicant did not meet.","The respondent applied for an interim injunction restraining the respondents from further proceedings in respect of charges prosecuted against him pursuant to the constitution, bylaws and regulations of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada (I.D.A.). The application was made pending the outcome of an application for certiorari quashing the decision of the disciplinary panel. The respondent had been found guilty of professional misconduct. The appeal Division found that the circumstances in which the respondent was found to be in did not meet the test set out in McFetridge v. Nova Scotia Barristers' Society (18.S.R. (2d) 319. The trial judge reversed the respondent's decision and ordered a new hearing. This was a very special case and the normal test in interim injunction cases is to find on a balance of convenience that it is necessary to obtain time for the court to adjudicate the issues arising from the special circumstances of the case and that the consequences of not staying in the lower proceedings would be serious and irreversible."
4_2005nspc10.txt,"The defendant was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine, both for the purposes of trafficking. When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it. The police opened the knapsack and found beer bottles, narcotics and a large amount of cash. In the front pocket of the knapsack, the police found the defendant's wallet with identification and personal papers. They also found packages of cocaine in the console of the vehicle. The defendant, who was not the owner of the vehicle, was not present when the search was conducted. The owner of the vehicle testified that he had picked up the defendant in his vehicle earlier in the day and that the defendant had placed the knapsack in the vehicle. When the police arrived, they both got out of the vehicle and the defendant left. The defence argued that the evidence was all circumstantial. The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine and cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. The evidence seized by the police was admissible against the accused on the basis that the marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's knapsack were being used to search the vehicle for liquor and cocaine. The accused denied having anything in the personal possession of the accused. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the presence of the item in question, consented to its presence and had some measure of control over it. It is also obvious that he had control of the bag and its contents until he left the motor vehicle. The Court found that the accused was in possession of drugs and money when he entered the vehicle."
e_2006skca55.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the court accepting fresh evidence. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed. There being no ground of appeal other than that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed. 1) Applying the case law to the fresh evidence, they fail the test for admission. 2) With respect to the evidence of Megan Bairos and her friend, we still do not have this evidence before us. All we have is the appellant's statement as to what they will say, which must fail on the basis of hearsay. Any evidence sought to be adduced under the discretion of what is now s. 683 of the Code must be admissible evidence. With respect to the evidence of Ms. Brinkman, she does not swear that Ms. Bodkin was selling methamphetamine at the relevant time. 3) With respect to due diligence, it must be noted that the appellant had the assistance of experienced counsel at trial and who represents him before this court. The appellant decided to proceed with the trial despite the absence of the two witnesses who he now seeks to put forward. If the appellant's application were to succeed, it would encourage the splitting of trial simply to obtain an order for new trial with all of the attendant delays and other problems. 4) In the court's view, the result could not reasonably be expected to be any different if the fresh evidence was admitted and a new trial ordered.","The appellant appeals his conviction for possession for the purpose of trafficking methamphetamine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His sole ground of appeal hinges on the Court accepting fresh evidence. The central issue at trial was whether the drugs found at the premises being rented by one s. Bodkin belonged to the appellant. The appellant did not follow the procedure outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lévesque in making this fresh evidence application. HELD: The application to adduce fresh evidence is dismissed.  1) The Court's focus is on credibility. The Crown's case is based, in large measure, on the evidence of the complainant, who was a large drug user at the time of the alleged offence. While clearly not determinative, the avoidance of evidence-splitting with all of its attendant problems results in a miscarriage of justice if the conviction were affirmed in light of the fresh evidence, the appeal is dismissed  2) On the issue of credibility, if believe the evidence, must acquit the accused of the charges. Even if do not believe the accused, but am left in reasonable doubt by it, an order for a new trial in this case would almost certainly result in the Crown being required to abandon the charges.(3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief and that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to affect the result."

The applicant sought a declaration that the plaintiffs' solicitors had breached confidentiality and were in a conflict of interest and asked that they be removed as solicitors of record in this action. The applicant's husband had given her personal letters, records and documents to his solicitor in 1995. These documents were relevant to a defamation action brought by her children or their spouses. The applicant argued that a fiduciary relationship was created when the documents were accepted which was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality and that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of that law firm acted for the plaintiffs.

There was no breach of confidentiality or conflict of interest as contemplated by Chapters IV and V of the Code of Professional Conduct.

The husband was not acting as agent for his wife nor was it accepted that he delivered the documents for safe keeping. The husband's solicitor had forwarded the documents to the applicant's lawyer.

The applicant sought an order declaring that the solicitors for the plaintiffs had breached confidentiality and were in conflict of interest between clients.

A fiduciary relationship was created between the applicant and the law firm when the documents were accepted. That relationship was close enough to a solicitor-client retainer to give rise to a need for confidentiality. Because the documents contained confidential information, it was submitted that the public's confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if any member of the Law firm were now allowed to act for the plaintiff. There could be no doubt that a solicitor client relationship existed and, therefore, Chapters IV and of the Code of Professional Conduct have no application. The Politeski Strilchuk Milen law firm acted for the applicant in 1995. His interests were then adverse to those of Lois Hudson who had her own lawyer. Whatever documents the applicant delivered to his lawyer in 1995 were not needed to support his legal proceedings. They were sent to Lois Hudson's lawyer.

b_2003nssf19.txt,"The Agency applied for the permanent care of four young children, aged 2 to 5 years. The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province. Although the expert evidence presented by the Agency was rejected due to its apparent lack of objectivity and the fact that the experts appeared biased by their access to the entire Children's Aid file which contained numerous unproven allegations, the court found that despite extensive remedial measures provided to the family, all four children would be at risk of harm if returned to either parent due to an environment of absence of necessities, multiple moves, one child having witnessed physical violence, medical needs not having been met, basic hygiene not having been met and basic supervision and safety concerns not having been met. The father failed to either protect the children or provide the necessities for them. Both parents were not willing to accept input from any professional. Neither parent could, nor wished to, change in the foreseeable future.","The Agency applied for permanent care of four children. The first child, S.M., was 5 years old at the time of her birth. The second child, O.D., was approximately 9 months old at that time. The third child (R.M.) was born approximately 15 months later and had continued head lice infestation. The Agency found that N.D. was neglectful and using corporal punishment as a method of disciplining her children. She was found to have an anxious conformity and displayed some form of mental retardation. All four children were in temporary care with the Agency when the mother was expecting her second child. All three children had been out of their mother's care since December 2001 when the Agency advised them that they were in need of protective services and that they would remain in the care of the Agency if the mother were no longer living in the residence. An assessment was held in January 2002 and the Agency determined that the child had a mild case of Aspergers' syndrome and that the symptoms of this condition were most likely caused by the failure of the parent to supervise adequately. Based on the evidence, the Agency concluded that it was reasonable for the Agency to consider moving the supervised access visits from the Agency Office to a more comfortable location in the Respondents home. As long as the parents were together, the children would be able to function. However, it was unclear when one looked under the heading'mental health of the children', why it was necessary for the assessor to chronicle whether or not she had tattoos, the nature of the tattoos, and how that would affect any determination that had to make, or that the Agency had made, on the basis of the substantial risk to the children that the parent was exposed to."

The Crown opposed release. An appeal of his conviction was not scheduled to be heard for several months; his sentencing hearing was slated for more than a month after the instant chambers application. Releasing the appellant pending sentence, that his detention was not necessary in the public interest. When the grounds of appeal do have some merit, the test for release should not be more strenuous at the early stage of the proceeding","The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault against his teenaged nieces. He was remanded until his sentencing. The trial judge refused to permit cross- examination of the complainant on an audio/video cassette without even having heard the contradictory statement. The appellant appealed on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law in failing to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant by the complainant, without even knowing she was there. The Crown opposed the application for release.The appellant, who was married, had three children and was self-employed fisherman, was the sole support of his family and had no previous criminal record. He had the onus of satisfying the three conditions of s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code. He abided by the terms of the release and had strong economic and family ties to his community."
b_1996canlii6710.txt,"The Department of Social Services requested a permanent custody order for a four and one-half year child pursuant to s37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act. The parents sought custody, or alternatively, to have the child remain with the present foster family. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18 years. It was strongly recommended that she remain in the foster parents' home where she had been for three years. The natural parents were to have reasonable access. 1)The child was in need of protection. The parents were unable to provide for all her needs even with the considerable assistance from the Department. She was exposed to severe domestic disharmony which could have resulted in emotional harm. The natural parents' ability to provide for her needs had not improved significantly. The child's special needs resulting from attention deficit disorder required enormous amounts of care and attention on a daily basis. 2)It was in the child's best interests to remain where she was and to continue to have contact with her natural parents.","The Department was requesting a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act. The infoster parents had cared for a four and one-half year old girl who was in foster care at the time of her first year with the assistance of parent aide, [F.S]. The parents now wished to have the child returned to their care or, alternatively, to have her remain with the present foster family on a long-term termbasis.

The foster parents testified that they had been in contact with the child for over 2 years and that they love her and would not take in any other foster children as long as they had her. Given the special needs of the child, it was unlikely that an adoption plan would be made, and indeed to remove this child from the [P.]'s home could be extremely damaging and emotionally traumatic for the children."
2_1999canlii12554.txt,"FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage,and in the alternative a variation in access. The father counter applied for interim custody. The parties agreed in 1997 that the father should have interim custody. The mother argued that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization for unipolar/clinical depression. The father had been employed as a long distance trucker but now worked days in the city. HELD: The applications for custody were dismissed. Overnight access was granted to the mother. 1)The application ignored the consistent law which states the courts should not vary interim custody arrangements whether legal or de facto in the absence of evidence that the child(ren) are in some way at risk, or other compelling reason. It constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The non-primary care parent should proceed to final order which in this provicne means obtaining a pre-trial date for a pre-trial conference and proceed to trial if custody is not resolved at that stage. 2)The court was satisfied on the basis of a number of medical letters indicating her emotional health was stable that the child was not at risk if the mother were granted overnight access.","FIAT. The applicant applied for interim custody of the one child of the marriage, born May 1993. By an agreement in 1997, the parties agreed that the husband would have interim sole custody. By November 1997 the wife was diagnosed as suffering from unipolar/clinical depression and had just been discharged from hospital. She was diagnosed with unipolar clinical depression and underwent treatment for depression. In 1997 she voluntarily admitted herself into the Royal University Hospital for psychiatric treatment. The respondent resisted the applicant's request for overnight access on the basis that she was the parent mainly responsible for the care and upbringing of the child prior to her hospitalization as the respondent was employed as a truck driver. After the agreement was entered into, the respondent changed jobs and now worked day job. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that it constitutes an error in principle, and a reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. The fact that the child will not be at risk if the parent is granted overnight access does not change the fact that this is a case where there is no reason to change the existing situation until trial."
e_2005nssc340.txt,"The husband applied to vary a corollary relief judgment in order to either terminate spousal support or decrease it with a fixed date for termination. The parties were married for twelve years and had been divorced for seven years. The husband had been paying $600 per month in spousal support since the divorce and had recently retired from the military; his current income was now primarily derived from his pension. The wife had serious long-term mental illness and was unable to manage employment. The parties' teenage son was now solely in the husband's care. Spousal support reduced to $300 per month payable for a further three years at which point it will terminate. Notwithstanding the wife's disability, the husband's obligation to her should not extend beyond the length of their marriage; although the wife might not be able to become totally self-sufficient, there was no evidence that she was unable to contribute anything at all towards her own support.","The wife had recently retired from the military and was in receipt of income from her share of the pension, which was just over $58,000 at the time of the application. The husband had been supporting the child for 12 years. They separated in 1996 and the son was living with his uncle. The wife's income had increased since the divorce and the applicant had been the sole provider for the son. He sought a termination of spousal support or a decrease in support with a fixed date for termination. She suffered from serious mental illness and had been unable to work. The applicant received a severance package and pension was to start in September 2005. He received an order for maintenance of $300 per month for five years, payable until August 2008. Because of the wife's disability, the length of time needed to be at the higher end. The application was heard in June 2005. It is not unusual for such orders to be indefinite at the outset. This is an application to vary after 9 years of continuous support. The court found that there has been a change in circumstances as required by the Divorce Act before variation can be considered. HELD: Spousal Support was to end in August 2008 for the wife. 1) The applicant's income was primarily derived from his pension. The fact that the wife was presently unemployed and had explained why she could not work made it more difficult for him to pay her. He was entitled to a lump sum payment in the amount of $843,000 that was to be paid to her. Her unchanged circumstances were juxtaposed against the applicant's decrease in income and his responsibility to meet the needs of their son. 2) The court was sympathetic to the husband's need for support and to the application's need to see an end to this obligation. Although he had some employment since retirement, there were not any hidden costs and the increased costs would continue and no doubt increase as the son pursues his education."

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues. A finding that there was a trust relationship between veterans and the Crown as to the administration of benefits would not determine whether there was a breach of any such relationship without an inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each veteran on a case by case basis. Aside from limitation problems, individual determinations will be required in order to ascertain whether the individual has a cause of action including for breach of a fiduciary duty, if one existed, to properly inform each proposed plaintiff, what information each received, whether he understood the information and made an informed decision. The Crown did not seek costs.","The plaintiffs apply for certification under The Class Actions Act on behalf of the following classes as set forth in paragraph 5 of the statement of claim: (a) Veterans Resident Class Any Indian person who served in the Canadian Armed Forces (Criminal Law); (b) Dependent Resident Class; and (c) Dependant Non-Resident Class. The plaintiffs claim entitlement to 'Survivors' Pensions' during the Class Period as common law partners of Contributors. The Crown has breached its fiduciary duty to the proposed class members and has been unjustly enriched. HELD: The Court held that there was no bar to the bringing of these motions even at the pre-certification stage of the proceedings. There were a number of limitations issues, some of which were common and others that would be individual to the class members."
d_2005skca149.txt,"The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of a custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act when he walked away from his designated residence and breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. The Crown appealed the decision. Appeal allowed; the Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the YCJA. The fact that the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended under s. 106 indicates that this proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section of the Code. The context of the decision is the same as that in R. v. Zundel (1992), [1998] S.C.R. 45 at para. 33; HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The proper Interpretation of Section 102(3) is that s. 102(1) is the provision referred to by s.102(2) which sets out the principles of rehabilitation and reintegration and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the respondent in custody. The real question before the Court is whether the sentence was deemed to be continuing to serve the youth sentence the young person is now serving and, if so, whether the provincial director has the authority to order a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the respondent. 2) The Court accepts the appeal but accepts the Crown's argument."

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The court has ruled on the substantive aspect of the application in separate fiat and rendered my decision in respect of the admissibility of some of the evidence the respondent put before the court. HELD: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. Settlement negotiations are protected by settlement privilege which is a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a waiver. As settlement communications are almost always irrelevant to the issues that are properly considered by the Court, it is rare that there will be any competing policy or, indeed, any reason to reference them at all. This is gamesmanship and nothing more."

Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties shared joint custody of the three children of the marriage. Primary care was to be with the mother. Although the parties disagreed on the value of the matrimonial home, both believed that the children benefited from it because it was a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. The mother argued that she was not included in the numbered company because she was ill at the time and not paying attention. She claimed that she contributed to the property by buying appliances, showing units and hiring staff. The father argued that he did not earn enough to pay such an expense and that the mother did not need it. Awarding the mother $986 per month, that there was no basis for an order requiring her to obtain a passport or to travel outside the country with the children. The court considered the circumstances of the couple's home and found that they were firmly settled into their local community. The children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. They must give the mother notice of the activity and the cost of their tuition."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time.

There was no waiver of the delay caused by the adjournments from May 2004 to November 2005. 2) The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19 2007. 3) The accused suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion and that such loss is minimal. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment was granted in favour of the plaintiff and the defendant together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)Under the present legislation the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the defendant, his spouse, his brother, or his hired help. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment to the cattle' ability to move around. 2)The evidence is that other neighbours' cattle may have been in the canola during the relevant period. However, the onus is on the plaintiff to establish the portion of the damage that was caused by the cattle. 3)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the trial."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter.

Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.

The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and service tax from his common-law spouse's company is questionable. 8)It is impossible for a bankrupt to justify his failure to pay taxes on a failed agreement. The principles and exemption in s.(295)5 of the Act were not proven.  9)The applicant's evidence was that it was their own fault they stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do.

Defendant sentenced to fine of $25,000, from which the sum of $15,000 shall be paid to the Canadian Farmers' Disability Registry; defendant ordered to perform 160 hours of community service with respect to farm safety. The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","The defendant pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he failed to take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The plea relates to the fact that there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. The defendant had been out all night, drinking and had not slept. He had made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy of Boake's death, including building a new dairy barn. He was in no condition to operate equipment, which he needed to remove manure from the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. He suffered from high blood alcohol concentration, had a blood-alcohol concentration of significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle and had spent substantial time and effort trying to improve safety at his farm. The deceased was 19 years old and had made significant changes to his farm in the wake of the tragedy to ensure that he would not have let an employer down by not showing up to work. Punishment should be mitigated by the defendant's lesser degree of culpability due to his failure to secure the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order or not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time."
2_2012nssc359.txt,"Rule 77.01 – Scope of Rule 77 This is a costs decision following litigation between the mother and father regarding apportionment of custody and access rights, quantification of child support and special expenses for the parties' children. The mother was the successful party and income was imputed by the court to the respondent.  Held, costs in the amount of $3,000 are awarded against the father. The father's position caused unnecessary time, effort and delay. The court referenced L. (N.D.) v. L. (M.S.) (2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77. Determining costs in a matrimonial manner is more complex given mixed outcomes and the burden of costs placed on families and children such that the court may need to exercise discretion and move away from a strict application on tariffs.","The parties litigated the apportionment of custody and access rights and the quantification of child support and special expenses for their two children. The respondent sought to award costs valued at $3,000 based on an application of Scale of Tariff 'A' of the Costs and Fees Act, supra. This proceeding required two days and additional chambers time when the Court was required to resolve disagreements between the parties. The Applicant's initiative in seeking to vary the existing order was not reasonable and responsible. Income was imputed to the respondent by the Court. Mr. Williams's submissions needlessly resulted in the expenditure of time and effort by all involved and delayed the issuance of an order herein. In the end, the Court imputed an income level to the applicant that Ms. Pellicer was prepared to accept prior to the commencement of the hearing ($25,000)."

The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.

The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff in April 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17, Plan No. 85SC07177, Extension 0, Burstall.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The defendant brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the plaintiff to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs sought to have the defendant's counsel examined on her affidavit. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1) The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. Secondary the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act precludes this type of pre-certification notice. However, the plaintiff has had ample opportunity to acquaint herself with prospective plaintiffs through a 'lawful manner'. 2) The plaintiff does not seek to compel the defendant to reveal the names of the nine property owners who have, to date, received the package. While not expressly requested, assume that the plaintiff wishes to have that information disclosed. It is acknowledged by counsel for the plaintiff that they may, in turn, send out their communications in effort, presume, to 'correct the record'. 3) The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 4) The purpose of the motion is to give further initiative to the court to look past the clear wording of sec. 2 of the SCC Act to'save the day'. The practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under the Class Actions act. 5) It is important to keep in mind in reading cases from Ontario that neither the section dealing with the service of notice (section 19 of the Ontario Class Proceedings Act) nor the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate (SCC Act) are limited to actions that have already been certified. 6) The plain wording of the two actions is that either the plaintiff is entitled to demand that the defendant provide information about other customers who may have booked through its office with Red Seal during the purposed class. The examination may even be more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt via Ms. Moore to get information from Red Seal as to other customer data base that could be of interest to the defendant, to the plaintiff."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. It was clear that Ottenbreit J. set an order for fixed and short term in order to give the respondent an opportunity to find appropriate employment and become self sufficient. The fact that the respondent had had and still carries the burden of primarily maintaining Catherine was also a factor which militated against retroactive support. The order was based solely on calculation of the parties' respective incomes, as found or imputed. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Antigonish or other entities of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education (the 'Minister') is required to reimburse the board for the costs incurred by the board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. The applicant board submits there is an inequity where it is required, in order to deliver the basic public school program, to lease buildings from a third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. The Province is not required, at least at this time, to pay the cost of these leases."

The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of unpaid child support paid for his 2 daughters by one-half. An earlier corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted.

The father was ordered to file a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing income received from employment with the maintenance enforcement office commencing September 30, 1996 and every three month period until the arreaars are paid in full. 1)The father was employed and had custody of the 2 daughters. JUDGMENT: The Court ordered that the father pay child support of $300 per child per child during months when his gross monthly earnings are $2,200.00 or greater and $150.00 per child when he is less than $2200. He was also ordered to pay $200 per month on arrear in addition to his on-going child support obligation. 2)The Court ordered the father to file affidavit evidence pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment in respect of his income."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now shows that substantial offers were made through counsel, although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the Court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant’s entitlement to the estate. HELD: 1)The applicant was awarded costs in lump sum. The respondent was ordered to pay the applicant post-judgment interest at a rate of five percent per annum from the date of the award until judgment is satisfied.  2)The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from when the offer was made. The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid from the award date, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the application by the applicant. A settlement offered in September 1996 would have been equivalent to approximately $230,000 but, following the pre-trial conference, the respondent offered settlement at $156,000 which would be roughly equivalent to 1/2 of that amount. In the alternative, the applicant sought solicitor & client costs to be Paid from September 1996, which would result in a reduction in approximately $5,000 in fees and disbursements.  3)In fixing an amount, the Court is faced with the dilemma of whether costs should be fixed at $20,000 or reduced to a lump sum, depending on the circumstances. It was concluded that the respondent was not prepared to pay costs until the judgment was satisfied. 4)Solicitor and Client Costs are within the discretion of the Court and the re-hearing of this issue does not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs (although the respondent has been awaiting the outcome of this application in order to satisfy the judgment)."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with written reasons to follow. 1)The court reviewed the relevant case law and found that settlement should not be taken as an application to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. 2)The respondent's correspondence with the appellant constituted an agreement to settle the matrimonial property issue. 3)The fiat in question was set aside and the evidence set aside as evidence. 4)Allowing the appeal was that the courts in Zimmerman and Childs were dealing with something entirely different: an agreement fixing value of few items of property, reached during the course of negotiations with view to an overall property settlement between the parties. There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each individual item agreed to would constitute a separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce."

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. HELD: The court granted the applicant some costs even though it has been unsuccessful on the issue of forum non- conveniens because in different sense the applicants have not been successful in getting what they want. The court will keep those costs relatively low. The amount of costs proposed is $400.00."

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked. At trial, the Crown argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive anATV on the road. The defence argued that since there was no nexus between his driving of the motor vehicle and the revocation of his driver's licence he was guilty of the offence. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges. The Court found that the defence was not exempting ATV's from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act. Even if they did, he was still charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle in the highway, contrary to s. 230(1) and his 'driver's license' was revoked, which was not the charge before the Court. The case did not shift to whether this was the case to determine whether the all-terrain vehicle was still prohibited under the Act or not, since it was still registered and insured under the Crown."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","The accused was charged with five Criminal Code offences arising from incidents occurring on or about August 22, 2015 in Humboldt, Saskatchewan. The accused was convicted of dangerous driving, assault and dangerous driving. He appealed his conviction on dangerous driving and a three-month driving prohibition. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact are supported by the evidence. The standard of review on appeals from sentence has become more deferential following the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2015] SCR 1089. In this case, the accused conceded that the incident occurred on a two lane residential street. This was not an infrequently travelled country road. Since the accused was driving parallel to the complainant, his driving could have presented danger for oncoming vehicles or pedestrians. The fact he was overtaking her, pushing her toward the side of the road, and deliberately cutting her off to avoid an accident are all factors which elevate the dangerous nature of the accused's actions."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school (École de Bellegarde) for the benefit of their children. In February 2013, the school administration informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children filed a complaint with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging that the school had discriminated against them because they had a service dog. In August of 2013 the plaintiffs, as represented by the lawyer, applied for an interlocutory injunction that would order the school to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. On September 10, 2013 the defendant applied to strike the plaintiffs' statement of claim. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF and their failure to encourage the children’s learning in French and to encourage their participation in the French immersion program. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-rights holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with its discretion.  1) The Court reviewed the relevant caselaw in s. 25 of The Education Act and found that it would be impossible for the plaintiffs to demonstrate that they had not been discriminated against because of their disability. The Court awarded special damages to the plaintiffs for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the application to dismiss the claim, the cost of training and re-training the service dog, notwithstanding compensation that might otherwise be available to the plaintiff under the Animal Protection Act; and general damages for out of pocket expenses, travel expenses, expenses, costs of the training and refreshment for the children."
4_2000canlii2523.txt,"The applicant, having received a tentative subdivision approval, applied for final approval. In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer applied for and failed to receive final subdivision approval. The applicant applied for tentative subdivision approval in 1997 and received the same in 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The development officer declared the application incomplete and declared it to be in fact complete. The developer appealed the decision of the development officer quashing the application, declaring it incomplete and requesting an order of mandamus. HELD: The application was set aside. 1)The Municipality relied on s.278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Applicant took issue with the decision to declare it incomplete. On the same basis, the Applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete.  2)The applicant had met all applicable conditions of s. 283 and the plan'shall' be approved. The Planning Officer had a different interpretation of the law. The fact that the applicant had failed to comply with the new road standards and one of the bearings on the plan was missing was a major issue for the developer. The Municipality therefore erred in law in finding the application to be incomplete. 3)The only remedy available to the applicant was an order in the nature of certiorari quashing, declaring the application in fact incomplete and c.emitting mandamus which is equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. In applying this test to the facts of the case at bar there is essentially only one issue to be determined: whether or not there is another legal remedy that is equivalent, beneficial or appropriate to mandamus, given the intermingling nature of statutory deference and deference to the law in this case."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation was amalgamated with the defendant corporation and held itself out as an energy efficiency consultant. The defendant entered into a letter agreement whereby the defendant agreed to pay 50% of the energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff opposed the agreement and brought a motion to stay the action on the basis of forum non conveniens. In this action, the plaintiff claimed damages for three Hundred and Ninety Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) for failure to file a defence and alleged that the defendant failed to conduct detailed analysis it undertook and that any recommendations were superficial and of no help to the plaintiff who had rejected the plaintiff's efforts to claim substantial payments alleged by the defendant to represent its share of the plaintiff energy savings, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant. HELD: The defendant's application to set aside the default judgment was dismissed.  1)The case law applicable to this application is different. In Nova Scotia, the defendant was not seeking to cure its default default by either agreeing to take default under Civil Procedure Rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages. 2)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the court that the Order was nullity.  3)The plaintiff had met the burden of establishing that there is a substantial issue to be tried and, in order to do justice between these parties, should exercise its discretion in favour of this defendant."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. HELD: 1) The respondent owned one-quarter of the estate land and it is agreed that his share is matrimonial property. Therefore, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The court found that the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the three natural children of the marriage. It is also agreed that the petitioner receives the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of the third child. The Court ordered that the sum be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children to obtain the total payable for the three children. 3) The petitioner is presently employed and the respondent's income is unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, the court declined toorder any Spousal Support.  4) The Court of Appeal reduced the petitioner's value of estate land to $115,155.19 less $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals."
4_2005skqb542.txt,"The Government seeks an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the plaintiff to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and pursuant to Rule 173 of the Rules and order striking portions of the pleadings. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government seeks an order requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars in order for it to properly defend the action and not be taken by surprise. The plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit the plaintiff to properly defended the action. HELD: 1) The pleadings do not fulfill the requirements of Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. There is no allegation in the appellants' pleadings that the Government acted in its own self-interest and against the interests of either party. The defendant has referenced a statute which was not in effect in 1963-1973 when the plaintiff claimed he was attending the school. If there is a chance that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be driven from the judgment seat. If the plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same. 2) The response that the particulars demanded are within the knowledge and peruse[sic] of the Defendant and as such, the plaintiff is not obliged to provide further particulars. The decision was reserved pending the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada."
