1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. 1) The Court found that the causal connection test established in Pelech should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. 2) The court found that there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances which required a reduction in the amount of maintenance payable. 3) There was truly finality to the financial relationship between the parties. 4) There were no radical changes in the circumstances of the former spouse. 5) The respondent's application to vary was denied due to the fact that the parties had, by their agreement, clearly provided for the termination of their financial relationship. 6) The evidence of the accountant who prepared his 1991 income tax returns and financial statements supported the conclusion that substantial variations in the income of the respondent could occur. The Court concluded that radical change was not the type of radical change that would trigger the review of the decree nisi."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer. HELD: It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intended to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name was not to be disclosed.","FIAT. The only matters reserved reserved were the names of the Crown's defence counsel and the lawyer who released the information. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of the defence counsel's memorandum to the investigating officer. Preliminary examination showed that the privilege applies only to the client and his solicitor. The information already disclosed is to some extent hearsay and is only marginally relevant.

She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act.

1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff sought dismissal of the action pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 20.09. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had deprived its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin which that vessel would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant to the calculation of the value of the landings and that it should be calculated using truck scales. The defendants argued that they were deprived of their interest in the fishing vessel because they did not have records of its weight. Dismissing the application, that the evidence presented by the plaintiff was unsatisfactory. The evidence showed that the plaintiff did not know of the existence of the truck scales and that they had been used by the defendant to calculate the weight for the fish. HELD: The dismissal was granted. 1)The plaintiff had failed to make reasonable effort to produce documents and information and to give full discovery to the defendant. 2)The defendant was not under the distinct obligation to reveal that information to the court. 3)The court found that the defendants had not made sufficient effort to provide the plaintiff with the information requested. The court found the defendant's employees did not make the required effort to obtain and filter the information supplied. 4)The Court found that there was no evidence the defendant, through its employees, supplied the fictitious true weight. 5)The evidence presented was insufficient to conclude that the failure to produce the necessary information was attributable to the failure of the plaintiff to make the necessary effort. The Court concluded that the only information the defendant provided was that of the actual weight of fish received. The only record of that weight was the weight information sought by the defendants. 6)Where there was a failure on the part of a party or his solicitor or, in the case of the Crown or body corporate, or an officer, to make a reasonable effort, the court imposed on the defendant such terms or penalty as it thinks just. This is contrary to the spirit and intent of the Civil Procedure Rules. 7)The defendants were required to provide evidence to the Court."
1994canlii4661.txt,"A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies. 18 months of the previous sentence remained to be served with the result that the total time in custody would only be increased by 6 months as a result of the 2 robbery convictions. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","This was an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result of his having committed two armed robberies. The two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the remainder of the previous term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the need to uphold public safety and the deterrence of the administration of justice. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent that it was served by the Court of Appeal. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the respondent. The sentence was not fit. An additional six month period of secure custody for these armed robberies does not meet either the interests of rehabilitation or the rehabilitation of the offenders, nor the requirements of deterrence. Nor does it meet the need of public confidence in the law and its administration by the courts. The respondent has an extensive record of property- related and other offenses, including failures to comply with the processes of the court and the orders of the Court. He has taken increasingly serious crimes. The weight of the law has now to fall on him more heavily if it is to achieve its objectives."
1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were a capable caregiver. The Court ordered the custody of the child to be granted to the parents who were both working full-time and who had a disability. The father was unable to work and was dependent on disability payments received from an insurer. The mother was also unable to attend to the child's needs. The court found that although the father had good parenting skills, he was not a capable caretaker. The child had special needs and the Court ordered joint custody with the mother. The custody order was granted because the father wished to play a more active role in the child care process. Because of the father's employment disability, he remains available to provide full time care for the child and exhibits a very strong desire to do so."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of a property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman who lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with his nephew. The application was brought in his name and in broader sense an application on behalf of the applicant's extended family. HELD: The applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for appointment as property guardian. The Public Trustee was to be the property guardian for the applicant.  1)The applicant was of the opinion that he was capable of managing some of his affairs and that some of the proceeds from the land sale should be placed directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and his day-to-day activities with the balance being placed in the hands of the Public Trustees as his property guardian to appropriatelyadminister in his longer term best interests. 2)The Court found that the applicant was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. The Court ordered that the vesting order be postponed for 45 days to allow the applicant to bring an application returnable within the 45 days."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appeals an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s. 49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The statistics generated by the Committee illustrate that the cardiologist's cost per patient is dramatically higher than that of the group mean comprised of his fourteen cardiologist peers. The Committee found that the Committee erred in improperly placing the burden of proof on the director and the Committee in favour of the Director of Professional Review. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. 2)It was impossible to assess institutional bias raised by the Director and Committee in the hearing conducted by them. 3)There was a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias.  4)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings."
1998canlii13992.txt,"The plaintiff's residence, a mobile home, was totally destroyed by fire in 1996. The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started. The plaintiff testified that he was awakened by the smoke detector buzzing a few times and found the home already to be in flames. He rushed to his grandparents' house to have them call the fire department. When he returned to the mobile home, his brother, who also lived on the farm site, was present and attempted to gain access to the home but were prevented by the heat of the fire and heavy smoke. When the defendant called the police, they called the fire brigade. When they arrived at the scene, the plaintiff gave substantially this version of what he saw after being awakened. The Defendant met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and has established that the fire was deliberately set. While there is no direct evidence to establish that the defendant intentionally caused the fire, the more unlikely or improbable the allegation required to be proved, the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood or improbability."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments to January in each year. The employer sought to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. HELD: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A. and Flinn, JJ.A.; the Court of Appeal held that the issues in the employer's application were outside the exclusive scope of the collective agreement and that the Court's jurisdiction was properly made under Rule 14.25. The Court was also of the view that there were several factual questions relevant to that issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 13.5."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, statements of account, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. The applicant sold unapproved investments of the applicant and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. The respondent continues to refuse to turn over its property and client files. HELD: The application was denied. The court found that the relief sought should issue with the right of the respondent to make and keep copies of the documents turned over to the applicant, and that part of the order may issue. The issue of contractual right to have injunctive relief is not conclusive. It is only one factor in the exercise of the discretionary power of the court. The provision for an injunction is important in its influence upon an exercise of that discretionary power to grant a temporary injunction. The Court found that an agreement for the issuance of an injunction, if and when a stipulated state of facts arises in the future, is binding on the court to that extent. Such an agreement would serve to oust the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to determine whether an injunction was appropriate when applied for and to require its issuance even though to do so would be contrary to the opinion of the SC."

The Court considered the total evidence and the credibility of the witness. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the Court was not persuaded that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the Information tried before it that the accused, P.J.N., had sexually assaulted the complainant or touched her for a sexual purpose or at all.

2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Provincial Court did not have jurisdiction to proceed with the trial. The Court relied on the case of R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 869, decision of the Court of Appeal.  1) The conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrine of recent possession. 2) There was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is as contended on behalf of the appellant that the sentence should be vacated and sentence imposed in this Court in lieu of it. It appears that in these unique circumstances, s. 687 of the Criminal Code permits that to be done."

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Court of Appeal refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The mother argued the chambers judge erred in failing to give adequate consideration to the factors he was required to consider, and by placing too much emphasis on irrelevant factors, in his determination of whether it was in the best interests of the child that the adoption be granted. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with.

2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child, d.o.b. with access to her former spouse. The respondent moved for interim child support pursuant to s. 15 of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) retroactive to January 1, 2006 together with special or extraordinary expenses. The consequent reduction of family debt is a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. The petitioner shall pay to the respondent 71% of those costs which is monthly sum of $125.00. HELD: The Court ordered that the respondent pay $625.00 per month as child support for the child born October 15, 1996. 1) The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income. 2) The respondent is no longer expected to contribute $80 per month to service family debt. 3) In the circumstances, the petitioner is ordered to pay $700 per month in the amount of $700.00 to the petitioner.  4) The Court is making no award as to costs.  5) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting."
2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) An order pursuant to s. 135(2)(b) of The Non Profit Corporations act, 1995 declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. 2) The respondent applies under the non-profit corporation provisions Act 1995, c. N-4.2 (the Act) seeking sundry relief, the Net result to set aside. 3) The applicant has another barrier which he cannot clear. He convocated from the University of Saskatchewan in the spring of 2006. As this matter was argued in September 2006, he is no longer a member of the USSU, nor is he director. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 4) In the interim, the applicant applied under s. 225(1) of the Act. The respondent was granted the task of assessing the true meaning of the word 'election' in the section as anything other than referring to the election of director or auditor. The court found that it would be an error, and clear misreading of the section, to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass referendum by non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. The applicant was granted interim relief. 5) The application to strike portions of the affidavits submitted on behalf of others was dismissed. 6) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. The EB is considered to be the ultimate decision making authority. The relief available to the applicant is academic given the relief available."
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The defendant agreed to supply the plaintiff with a guarantee that the plaintiff would hold the equipment in possession until full payment was received. At the time of the sale, the plaintiff was experiencing some health issues and was seeking to establish himself as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by the aforementioned Hodgins Auctioneers. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The plaintiff sued the defendants for breach of contract. The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mailboxes in Melfort and area. The plaintiffs were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as presence in the regional market that the public perceives it to be so. They were also keen to demonstrate that they could deal with the challenges posed by the retiring farmer and his family members. HELD: While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. While there are some concerns regarding the use of 'puffers' or 'puffing' terms used to describe secret bidding at auction by or on behalf of seller, or attempts to run up the price by making spurious bids on behalf the owner. While a few issues require the exploration in this case, it is clear that the pre-trial discussions were pre-emptive and the defendants were the ones who were too busy to attend to details of the auction."
2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","This was one of those cases where there was no clear winner. Both parties contributed to the length of the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to, and during, the trial. The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. HELD: 1) Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. However, in this particular case I have no confidence that any offer made by either the plaintiff or the defendant would have resolved this case in advance of trial. 2) The intent of rule 41A is to induce settlements and avoid trials. There should be a departure from the prima facie operation of the rule only where the interests of justice clearly require it. There is no such thing as a 'clear winner' in this case.

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agreed that given the age of the children and the change in the amount of support they were receiving, that there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The application for child support was adjourned until November 1, 2008.  2) The parties agree that given that the children were attending university and working part time and how this would affect the Guideline amounts payable by the applicant, that the difficulties that could arise in enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the applicant. 3) In this case, the parties agree the child of the marriage is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. The difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement would mitigate against such a variation.  4) The Court reviewed the law concerning the payment of child support assuming that the child is of the age that the parties are married and the parties have a child. It is well-settled that full time attendance in post-secondary education may result in a child over the old age of majority qualifying as 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. However, the Court found that the respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for Keegan directly to Keegan. The Court found the respondent was not providing support in an appropriate fashion. The court also found that there would be difficulties in enforcing the order. 5) In the interim, any such payments made shall be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support and then towards the arrears.  6) The court found that given Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, is not a parent seeking to establish an obligation to pay child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, but could once again become a child of that marriage if he attends university beginning in the fall of 2008 as he intends. 7) The father was to pay $500 per month towards the current child support payable directly to him.  8) The children were not at the present time a child but attending university once they had reached the age where support automatically terminated."

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was a consignee within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act and inter alia the question of whether or not a consignmentee is a'retail seller' as defined in that Part.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born in Canada. They were married and the family home was in Connecticut. The respondent mother, an American citizen, had returned to Canada and brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The application was granted. 1) The Court was at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residence under the Convention.  2) More than a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of judicial proceedings and it can be demonstrated that the child is now settled into his new environment. The Court is of the opinion that the circumstances in which the respondent and the child were forced to return to Canada are inextricably linked to the residence of the respondent. 3) More then a year since the removal, the child has been ordered returned. The court is of a view that the law requires a settled purpose and that there is no conflict between the Act (and therefore the Convention) and any other provincial legislation. 4) In this case, the Court is at odds with the case law developed by the Court of Appeal. The concern over chasing orders, at the Supreme Court level, was rendered academic by way of undertakings given by the father not to take physical custody of the child upon his return to the child. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point, for the purposes of the Act, the court was to order the return of the Child. 5) The court was of the view that there was a significant difference between a person ceasing to be habitually resident in a country and his subsequently becoming habitually a resident in country. 6) In the circumstances where the child was removed or withheld from his or her habitual residence, there was no evidence that the Child's habitual residence was in Canada and any short-term harm to the Child was ameliorated. 7) In these circumstances, it is appropriate to impose some sort of condition on the petitioner."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","HELD: The Court found that the father was unable to meet the physical amenities of life for the two young boys. The Court ordered a Section 19 custody and access assessment. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care and control of either parent. The father was not presently providing the physical necessities of life. The mother's actions were so egregious that they resulted in the children suffering from severe anxiety and depression. The court found that if the father were to continue to smoke drugs regularly and financially support a drug habit, this would automatically divert funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. The parents were also at risk of having their children placed in primary care of the father. The Children were particularly at risk because of the mother's frequent drug use. HELD: 1)The Court found the father to be incapable of providing the necessary and appropriate parenting. 2)The father was found not to be able to provide the physical and mental amenities of a two-year-old child. 3)There were other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here. 4)There are other examples of a parent who is unable to met the needs of his children on a daily basis. 5)The Father was not employed. He was not providing adequate physical amenities for the children. His type of parenting falls very short of the expectations of the court. The Father is not providing sufficient physical amenities to the children, but with a change of primary care provision of the order. 6)The children were exposed to daily and troublesome drug use by the father, which resulted in a malaise which operates as a direct obstacle for the adequate provision of daily care by the mother. He is also at a high risk of addiction to marijuana, which has a negative effect on the children's short and long term care. 7)The Children were at risk to be placed in secondary care and the father is not able to continue working full-time. It is clear that the mother is suffering from a severe anxiety disorder. The persistent and daily use of marijuana has created malaises which operates a direct dependency on the father and his overall ability to stay clear of violent and drugs. The current parenting plan of the Father is very short-sighted and fails to provide adequate support to the two children.

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by the Supreme Court of Canada (Family Division). On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to the filing of the petition. The appellant argues that if the stay is not granted and the appeal is successful, Nova Scotia will have jurisdiction to determine whether the appellant was wrongfully retaining the child in the Nova Scotia area. HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed with costs in the cause.  1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of such an order obtained after trial. 2) The Court found that there would be no irreparable harm if a stay was granted and there was no pending execution order to be granted. 3) The court found that it would be risky not to participate in the process there.  4) Since Nova Scotia is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.NS, c. 387, the Child Abduction Act, which implements the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child abduction would be applicable.  5) The order under appeal is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10 and that the application for stay should be dismissed for that reason."

The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act, 1985. They each brought a series of variation applications under the Act. HELD: 1) The application to vary spousal support was dismissed.  2) The parties have made numerous cross-applications concerning child support. The first issue is whether the respondent should pay base guideline child support of the three children of the marriage in the amount of $3,088.20 per month retroactive to December 20, 2003. The quantum of child support is adjusted annually based on the father's annual income for the previous calendar year. 3) The Corollary Relief Judgment provided (by apparent agreement) that the children remain in the respondent's care. 4) The respondent shall pay base standard child support in the range of $592.20 to the mother. The respondent is responsible for her own choices. 5) There is no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would, had it been known at the time of the original order, resulted in a different order of spousals. The order contemplated her parenting the girls she was receiving a significant amount of support. However laudable this proposed organization may be there is no reason for the respondent to fund its establishment. The children are responsible for their own choices."" The respondent's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month. This is the same annual income as it was for April and Sarah. 6) There was no evidence of health problems that would impair her. There was a regular deduction made by his employer which would be akin to an income tax deduction that would be made if the respondent were resident and working in Canada. 7) There were no other issues before the court. The Court reviewed the Corollaries Relief Judgment and found that the respondent had not met that onus on her. The court found that it was appropriate that there be any variation prior to this date. 8) The Court found that there was no reason to vary the respondent’s monthly support."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the defendant's open web steel joists. The defendant claimed the actual repairs were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not necessary to repair defects to the joist. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1,000,000.00.  1)The plaintiff was not asked to determine the quality of the work performed during the fabrication of the plaintiff's joists; 2)Costs were determined to be reasonable. 3)The court found that the plaintiff had not demonstrated a real and substantial danger to the occupants of the building. The plaintiff had failed to demonstrate a real or substantial danger. 4)The defendant was found to have breached the plaintiff’s standard of repair. 5)The plaintiffs were awarded $5,000 for the repairs and remedial costs."
2_2007skca24.txt,"The applicant seeks leave to intervene in this appeal. The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.  1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers. Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The Mutual Fund is the respondent and the respondent consents to the intervention. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. The proposed intervenor has additional arguments to make. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue and the application for intervention with some strict conditions. HELD: The application was allowed. The respondent may file a reply if it chooses to do so on or before March 8, 2007. The mere fact the proposed intervener has additional argument to make is not determinative of the issue. However, the court sees no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on appeal."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children. The parties separated in 2003 and the usual relief was claimed, namely: divorce, joint custody, access, child support, spousal support and division of family property. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $4,237.16 for the three children in 2004, 2005 and 2006. 2) It would be fair if the contributions were equal, taking into account that the incomes are presently comparable. 3) An appropriate retroactive variation should be effected. 4) The petitioner claimed for a full day's wages. During that time incomes varied somewhat and it could be said that the distortion was eliminated. By joining it with the 2005 income the distortion is eliminated. It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactively variation now be effected (40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purposes of the capital cost allowance). 5) The costs were incurred over some 3 years in the past. During the past the income varied somewhat. The distortion is now eliminated. The consequent calculation is as follows: the respondent should pay $476.00 month as support for two children in the monthly sum of $564.00. The monthly difference payable to the respondent is $135. For the two months he is entitled to credit of $270."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the scene and had been in the vehicle since the time the group entered the vehicle. HELD: 1)The defence evidence lacks reliability.  1)At the time of the individuals getting into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; at no point did anyone other than Ms.Neigel have operation of that vehicle; she was the one who backed it out and again pulled it in. 2)The evidence of the police officers was not supported by the evidence. 3)The police evidence lacked credibility. The evidence was not accepted as a fact. The police evidence did not leave me in a state of reasonable doubt. 4)The accused's evidence was unreliable. The facts were not supported. 5)At no point during the day did the accused state that she had the keys. At no time did she say that she was going into the bar to get off-sale, the police would simply have to have observed her exit the vehicle and then pulled her out. The fact that the police had the vehicle in their sight when the group first entered the truck and were in it for the first time since the group left the bar does not leave a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused."

3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s.253.2 of the Criminal Code. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and to have the evidence of the complainant and the learned trial judge. Dismissing the appeal, that although the appellant had intercourse with the complainant, such was with her consent. Although the sentence can be considered at the high end of the range of sentencing for sexual assault, it is not manifestly excessive. It cannot be said that the eight years imprisonment was not a fit sentence."

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving and breathalyser tests. The accused agreed to take the usual two tests. At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. The evidence of the amount of alcohol he had to drink and the effect of the drink on him was not sufficient to constitute evidence to rebut the presumption of s. 258 of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The consent judgment option under s.172(2)(c) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they served. 1)The monthly family income after-tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $3,349 per month for the benefit of creditors. 2)The bankrupt consented to judgment and there will be ajudgment in favour in favour the trustee in the amounts of $40,000.00 for a total of $120,564.00 over the three year period.  3)The consent judgment was not enforced so long as the bankrupt pays to the trustee the sum of $1,250 per month on the first day of each and every month commencing in April 1996 and continuing thereafter on 1 month of each month thereafter for 36 months. There seems no reason why this income level cannot be maintained."
3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Human Rights Code. 1)The Act takes precedence over the collective agreement. The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreements. 2)The act has no application to a complaint of sexual discrimination arising out of the employment relationship between the employees and their employer. A board of inquiry appointed pursuant to the terms of the Collective agreement or a Board of inquiry established pursuant to it has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the matter. 3)The mere fact the Act includes an Article or clause that complies or a covenant not to discriminating on the grounds of the basis set out therein does not transform the situation from a serious human rights problem to a serious one. 4)The Board of Investigation was appointed by the Minister of Justice pursuant to s. 29(2) of the Code to investigate the alleged discrimination. The Board of Interscope was appointed to investigate and determine the complaint. 5)The Chamber judge correctly decided that the issue was confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complainant of sexual harassment to a hearing and determine whether an alleged act of discrimination occurred. 6)The fact that the parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in their collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of this complaint. It is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the right the statute seeks to protect. 7)A collective agreement is not an essential component of a human right. It does not have an essential character complaint arising from an employment relationship under the collective bargaining agreement. 8)The only forum which could resolve the issue is a board of arbitration appointed under the terms and conditions of the agreement. It would be preferable to have an arbitrator appointed under s. 25 of the Act. The only method of enforcement is the complaint procedure section in the code itself. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions"
3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The Court found that the failure to allow the cross-examine the complainant regarding another complaint she made about sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.  1) The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. 2) The failure to permit the cross examination of N.M. regarding a previous complaint of a sexual assault did not prevent her from having an honest and fair trial. 3) The trial judge failed to provide sufficient time to show the relevance of the factually relevant question that has as its focus the existenceof a previous complainant. The relevance is obvious. 4) The respondent was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities, but rather about a prior complaint of sexual assault and that question had a direct bearing on her credibility. 5) Even if there had been an application under s. 277(c), the Court would have found that it was improper to ask the respondent about a complaint of non-consensual sex. The respondent should have simply been directed to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of the respondent's previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault. That question had no relevance to the respondent’s credibility. 6) It was not a case which calls for an analysis of extensive evidence, rather it is dependant entirely upon finding of credibility and reliance upon the testimony of one person recalling an incident which occurred nearly ten years earlier. The need to extend this protection to non-Consensual sex is not apparent. The evidence that the respondent has engaged in a sexual activity, whether with the complainant or with any other person, is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant (a) is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge. 7) The Court held that the Crown is not taken by surprise that the"

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996 provided for the amalgamation of the Cities of Halifax and Dartmouth into the Halifax Regional municipality. The amalgamation included the joining together of the various municipal police forces under one administration. The plaintiffs were reduced in rank contrary to Regulation 4(3) of the Police Act. The issues raised by the plaintiffs were the nature of the dispute, the extent to which it is, in substance, regulated by the legislative and contractual scheme and the extent of which the court's assumption of jurisdiction would be consistent or inconsistent with that scheme. HELD: The decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal was informative as to the appropriate approach to be taken when there is such a threshold question as whether the limits of court jurisdiction can only be understood in light of the breadth of arbitral jurisdiction. The plaintiff was bound by the provisions of the collective agreement and the issues fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of an Arbitrator appointed under the provisions and the statute."

They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The accused sought to set aside evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim were the result of an assault. They alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence of the injuries and (ii) the Crown's failure to prove an offence of assault.

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential.

Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.

The Court held that the Court was unable to form an opinion of what damages were likely to be recovered by the plaintiffs at a final assessment of the damages and it was not appropriate to order an interim settlement. The court awarded the defendants $1500 plus taxable disbursements, which will be incorporated in the order accordingly. The plaintiff’s claim for loss of future earnings was largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and the broad array of medical reports in evidence so far do not indicate any pre-existing medical condition. Even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by discovery examinations or an independent medical examination, it is likely, given the nature of the injuries sustained in the accident, it would be likely that the plaintiff will recover substantial amounts of special damages."

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak application on behalf of the Homeowners for insurance coverage for their Swarovski crystal collection. The appellant prepared HomePak Application for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their home, including coverage for the Swarovsk crystal collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The respondent prepared a form, which cancelled the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. Unknown to the appellant, the appellant had arranged for coverage outside of that which is usually provided for by SGC. The trial judge concluded SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue the application submitted to SGI by the appellant. The evidence also showed that SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage which it had extended to the Draders under the McCallionum Hill SGI policy. Whether it had duty to do so or not, as claimed by the defendants, needs not be determined. The circumstances alone, combined with the application for insurance which SGI received, led this Court to conclude that SGE did breach its duty of care to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) in respect of the [TWC] policy it issued to replace the McCallsum Hill policy that expired the same date. SGI issued the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the collection, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. HELD: Appeal Allowed. 1) The circumstances combined, combined, with the applied for insurance (SGI's application for the insurance) created a special set of circumstances which warrant the creation of a 'new duty' to be imposed on the insurer. 2) SGI owed a duty to both the defendants and the plaintiffs to conduct its own review of the needs, wishes or desires of the applicant. The insurer was liable in negligence on the basis of the coverage provided to the respondent. The defendant contributed equally to the loss by their negligent acts, which was determined by the trial judge to be a'manual narrative'. The defendant was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. 3) The evidence satisfies me that the appellant was negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the homeowners, which he assessed at $7,739 (U.S.), pre-judgment interest and PST and GST, if payable."

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT. The issue was whether the children were to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent. HELD: The interim order was granted. The parties were to continue to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. The preservation of the status quo was in the best interests of the two children. The respondent was to make appropriate arrangements for the supervision of the children so that they are supervised prior to their attendance at school and after school if he is unable to personally provide the children with supervised supervision. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the parties were joint custodians for the boys. It was an error in principle, and reversible error in law to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of evidence of risk to the child. Therefore, the interim orders were made."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. There have been variety of applications to the court, court orders and unsuccessful pre-trial settlement conferences. HELD: The interim parenting order of September 28, 2010 was in effect. The children's primary interim residence was with the petitioner. The respondent's specified interim parenting time will be Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 PM and alternating weekends. The petitioner is prohibited from entering the respondent's said home until further order. The interim order will remain in effect until further orders are made pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of the Children's Law Act. The court will respond to the purpose, intent and substance of the petitioner's application. 1)The interim order was in reality an application for an order substituting a completely different parenting regime for the children. 2)On an interim basis only, the interim order of the respondent shall remain in place. 3)The Court will respond in the form of an interim order."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused left the area, went to the rear of the building and in close quarters, as the accused himself testified, threw a kitchen knife at the complainant. The complainant was injured in the confrontation with the accused and the complainant ran to his SUV vehicle. He was pursued by the accused, who was in the back of the store, and then chased him to his vehicle. The confrontation was described as a knife fight and the accused threw the knife. When the complainant confronted the accused in the parking lot, the accused walked up to him and in very close quarters the complainant threw a knife at him, striking the complainant in the face. The Crown called the complainant to give his evidence. HELD: When one considers the factors set out in ss. 34(2), the accused's actions in leaving the area and going back to his dufflebag to retrieve the knife were completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the complainant may have perceived was made or presented by the defendant in the circumstances of this case. The nature of the force or threat that was presented was not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. The Court concluded that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the complainant, in close proximity, as he himself testified and getting into his personal space. While the complainant's reaction and his statement was regrettably crude, disrespectful and insensitive to the victim, nevertheless the fact that he did not further assail the complainant or touch him, nor, as Mr. Drysdale admitted on cross-examination, pursue him as he left, could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against the plaintiff. The knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code."

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.

5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The corporate defendant solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations. He indicated that if no reply was made by October 25, 1993, the examinations would be unilaterally scheduled. The defendant solicitor responded that despite the letter they would be attending at the examinations, they would hold the defendants' obligations to attend as well. The defendants' solicitor wrote back to the defendant, claiming that he had 'difficulty' with the appointment of the proper officer and that he would need the appropriate conduct money. The solicitor for the defendant corporation wrote back and forth with the plaintiff that he was having difficulty with the appointments and that the appointments were made late in the proceedings. The court found that the defendants had deliberately set the dates and the plaintiff was not entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the hearings for discovery or for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examination. The Court found that there were two other reasons why the plaintiff could not be compelled to attend: 1)There was no court order designating the person who it proposed was the proper police officer to be examined on its behalf and secondly, he was no longer an officer or a director of the Corporation.  2)Failing agreement between the solicitors for the parties as to acceptable dates for examinations for the discovery of the individual defendant and the proper Officer of the defendant corporate defendant was a serious breach of the terms of the agreement. The parties had failed to meet their obligations under Rule 231 to set out the dates. It is clear from the terms and the order that the defendant solicitor has abused the discretion of the court to set aside the judgments obtained against him and to permit them to file defences. It was clear from these documents that the solicitor for both parties has consistently attempted to improperly thwart at every turn the efforts of the plaintiff to determine the matters raised in these lawsuits. The Defendants have demonstrated that on the basis of their conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings, that the plaintiff is guilty of contempt of court."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure.

The sole issue for determination was whether or not the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim's statements prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by s. 7 and 11 of the Code. The only issue for the Court to determine was whether the trust conditions sought by the Crown were inconsistent with the right to disclosure which flows from the constitutional guarantee of fair trial.

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment provided for basic child support to be paid by the respondent. The respondent commenced negotiations in November 2002 for an upward variation of child support for the two children of the marriage on the basis that the respondent's income was significantly higher than his expected annual income. The parties agreed that much of his income since separation had included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. It was self-evident that the appellant had a substantially greater ability to provide financial support to the children. HELD: 1) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,000, the respondent has a substantially more ability than Ms. Marzolf. It is selfevidently that the petitioner has a substantial ability to support the children of both parties after separation. 2) Based upon the Guidelines the respondent is entitled to pay child support of $1,186.00 on the first $150,000 of income and a further amount of $742.00 for each month thereafter. 3) Based the Guidelines, the child support payable for the respondent and the two parties is $1.186. It would be self-identifiable that the applicant has a significantly greater ability than the respondent to provide support for them."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling",The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for R and E.C.S. gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicants had made significant progress and that they were prepared to cooperate with the Agency. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to support granting leave to apply to terminate the order.
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals have been in custody since November 2004. HELD: The accused were released from detention. 1) The accused was released on a recognizance with conditions. The court refused to release the accused for the same reasons that his release was denied. 2) A review of the detention orders of Her Honour Judge McMurtry and her Honour Judge Snell would ordinarily be cursory.

Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","This was an appeal from a decision by an Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. The Court held that there was a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, that was not conferred 'officiously' and that such a relationship would not necessarily defeat a claim. The absence of a 'casual arrangement' would not defeat the claim.  1) The Court found that the Court had the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. 2) The presence of such a'special relationship' will be persuasive but not necessarily conclusive in the fact-finder's analysis. 3) There was no special relationship as contemplated by the McLaren, MacKinnon JA stated. For there to have been a special arrangement, the defendant must have had knowledge of the benefit, and he must have either requested it, or acquiesced to its performance. The facts established that there had been no such relationship. The essential nexus between the defendants' words and conduct, and the plaintiffs conferring the benefit. The court found that in the absence of such relationship, coupled with either request for or acquiescence in the receipt of the benefits, no recovery will be allowed. 4) The absence would not be persuasive or conclusive in fact."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The accused was stopped by police on foot patrol on the sidewalk near the courthouse. The officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. They approached him and smelled it on him. The officer smelled it and asked the accused where he was. When the accused indicated that he was in a mall, the officers approached him. They asked him where the marijuana was coming from and he told them that he dropped it at the mall. When they asked the officer where it was, the officer noted that it was in front of a mall. He said that he had just dropped a roach. The police officer asked the defendant where the smell of the marijuana came from and the accused said that it smelled like marijuana. The defendant was arrested and searched. Although there was no police caution, his statement was proven to be free and voluntary. The statement of the accused to the police occurred before the officer was detained and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise the accused of his rights. There was no violation prior to the officer's statement to the Police. The Court of Appeal concluded that the officer had reasonable grounds to arrest the accused for possession of cannabis. It also held that the accused had a reasonable belief that more, un-smoked marijuana would be present."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two offences. The first was for failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 74 of the Act. He suffered serious injuries and a short time later, he died as a result of his injuries. The second was for failure to properly supervise the labourer and to inspect the guardrails before work commenced in that area. The defendant failed to take every reasonable precaution to avoid the hazards of the work platform. He did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused Mr. Myles to fall off of the platform. The failure of the defendant to adequately supervise, inspect and attach the guardrail, and the error in judgment in believing that the steel I-beam could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case represented a serious failure in the defendant's safety regime."

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.

RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on solicitor-client basis. The condominium fees paid by the plaintiff are assessments levied against the title of the condominium owner's unit for unpaid contributions to the common expense fund or the reserve fund. These are charges allowable pursuant to s. 11 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act. HELD: The issue was whether the proper proportionate distribution of the pro-rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs of the remaining mortgage. 1) The plaintiff is entitled to solicitor- and condominium costs assessed. 2) The cond condominium fee paid by RBC are assessments against the mortgagor's land and are recoverable under the terms of the Mortgage. 3) The solicitor-general costs assessed by R.B. are directed to be assessed on a solicitor-and-client (S&P) basis. 4) The judgment for condominium and condo fees and property management charges is set at 2.79 per cent per annum. The solicitor‑client costs assessed are assessed on the S&P and the condo fee. The judicial sale by real estate listing was previously confirmed by the order of Danyliuk J of October 27, 2017.

The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. The appellant is 38 years old and at the time of the offence was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. Westcan is transporter of bulk cargo in the four western provinces and the western United States.

6_1994canlii4901.txt,"Dr. Huerto appealed a decision of a Joint Medical Professional Review Committee, pursuant to which he was ordered to repay approximately $384,000.00 to Saskatchewan Health. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",This was another appeal in a series of cases wherein a medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act provides that a physician who is aggrieved by an order of the joint medical professional review committee may appeal to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. There is no further right of appeal. HELD: 1)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials. 2)There was no factual foundation to support this allegation and the Committee did not exceed its jurisdiction in undertaking the review of Huerto's practice. 3)The committee did not have the discretion vested in it by the legislation in conducting the review. The Committee misinterpreted the Act and misinterpreted it. 4)There is no evidence to support the Committee's decision on the merits. 5)The evidence before the Committee reasonably supports the Committee’s findings. The committee did have the power to order any part of the amount so paid by the Minister to be recovered from the physician. 6)The Court of Appeal did not exercise its discretion to determine the nature of the billing pattern of a physician. 7)It did not err in law and on the evidence when it placed significant emphasis on statistical comparisons when he said that such statistical comparisons are of little value when his approach to practice involves more extensive patient visits and testing procedures and no hospital care. The Act clearly provides that the Director may refer to the Committee any matter where he believes that physician has been paid money by reason of any departure from a pattern of medical practice acceptable to him. 8)The decision of the Committee should be quashed for breach of the rules of natural justice. The court reviewed the factual findings of the committee and found that the Committee exceeded the jurisdiction by abusing its discretion. 9)The findings were not reasonably supported by the evidence and the material which it was entitled in law to consider.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic Provinces and it was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. The respondent had been hired as account manager with sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces. At the time of the dismissal, the appellant had not been given written response to her inquiries as to the effect of the purported change in the compensation scheme. She asked for a written response and was told to stay on the Zoloft for another month. She was subsequently diagnosed with depression and was given a month's notice. The trial judge concluded that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the dismissal was made, and that mental distress would not be an element of damages in a breach of contract case. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Court found that the principles of contract law set out in Hadley v. Baxendale provide the proper test for the recovery of damages for psychological distress. 2)The court found that there were two grounds for awarding damages for the mental distress which, to an extent, overlap. The first was that mental anguish would not necessarily be in a reasonable contemplation as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The second grounds were that the conduct of the appellant caused mental distress to the respondent, and he mischarged the jury on the question of foreseeability. 4)The principles of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts provide a broad application to decision-making based on priori and inflexible categories of damages. The issue in assessing damages is not whether the plaintiff got what he bargained for, i.e. pleasure or peace of mind (although this is obviously relevant to whether or not there has been breach) but whether he should be compensated for damage the defendant should reasonably have anticipated that he would suffer as consequence of the breach. 5)The jury found the appellant was entitled to six months' notice of the termination. The court awarded the appellant $10,000. The amount of damages increased on appeal to $50,000 and $50k respectively."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of the action, the defendant can deduct the cost of qualifying for such employment. The plaintiff carried on her duties in much the same way as she had done previously. These ways were not fully known to the new owners. For time the defendant operated from the Saxby books before the defendant's own set of books were put into use. The defendant's practice allowed employees to charge personal expenses and the authorization responsibility fell mainly on the plaintiff, with occasional consultation with Gary Saxby. The Crompton family operated business in the same premises for a number of months before the defendants purchased the business. Some of the employees at that time continued as employees with the new owner. The employer was entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but acts of the employer which constitute constructive dismissal entitle the employee to withdraw her services without reduction of the period. The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to holiday pay. The defendant claims that if the court finds that the defendant's holiday pay is not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the Labour Standards Act, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act. 1) The plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. 2) In the alternative, the defendant claims the plaintiff never claimed his holiday pay for 10 years and relied on the plaintiff not doing so. 3) The defendant asserts that if a court finds the plaintiff's holiday compensation is not properly calculated, it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff were now allowed to assert that right. 4) The court reviewed the various provisions of the LSA and found that the allowance was really a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. The doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. The court held that the Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction to entertain civil action for non-payment of holiday pay, in the event that the court determined this Court had jurisdiction. 5) The Court of Appeal held that if it found that a plaintiff's right to holiday compensation in the amount of 12 months' wages is limited, the court was required to grant the plaintiff the damages in lieu of overtime pay. 6) The judge reviewed the provisions of The LSA to determine the entitlement to holiday leave. The judge concluded that the issue of holidays should be severed from the jury and left in reserve until the court renders its decision. The Court reviewed whether the defendant could waive its entitlement to overtime pay and concluded that it was not necessary to do so. 7) In this case, the Court reviewed the factors which may be met either by showing an arrangement pursuant to s. 18 or by reference to an agreement under s. 62. The onus and burden in wrongful dismissal case rests with the plaintiff."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(b) and s.253(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in 40 km zone in the town of Martensville. Upon coming into contact with the accused, the officer noted a distinct smell of liquor and a slight redness in the accused's eyes. The officer asked the accused if he wished to contact a lawyer and the accused responded that he did not wish to. When asked if he could call Legal Aid, the accused stated that he could. The defence argued that the accused was entitled to a copy of the police report and that it was the officer's duty to provide the breath samples. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The accused's right to produce a breath sample was not infringed upon. 2)The Court reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that it might be suggested that the ampoules should be produced only upon the accused establishing at trial some basis to question the suitability of the solution. This was not a case of inability to comply but rather the refusal by the Crown to produce the requested ampoule. There was no evidence to the contrary as to why the officer did not provide a sample to the accused prior to giving the breath sample. 3)The respondent's Charter rights had been breached and the only appropriate remedy was stay of proceedings."

The court asked counsel to explore the possibility of conducting future exchanges of the child through the supervised exchange program. Costs will remain in the cause. The Court dismissed the father's application but with prejudice to any subsequent reliance on these events in the event of a future application for contempt.

An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children.

The respondent applied to vary custody of the children from the current shared parenting arrangement. Application dismissed; the evidence disclosed that the children were suffering from anxiety and defensive anxiety. There was a relaxed, casual nature to the children's intimacy with their father that allows for greater clarity of disclosure and discussion of needs, as well as sharing of day-to-day events.

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","The respondent companies applied for declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Titles and that it be reinstated retroactively to the date of its removal. The caveat was registered in 1972. In 1975 the land owner consented to the re-registration of the caveat. However, for reasons unknown, the caveat did not re-register at the time it was registered. In 1986 the respondent discovered that a caveat he believed had been re-registered in 1975 had, in fact, not been registered. The respondent companies argued that even if a mistake was made, as result of the principle of indefeasibility of title, the retroactive reinstatement of this caveat was not a permissible remedy due to the principle. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. 2) The Registrar had two feasible options in relation to how to address lapse procedures commenced under the old system but not completed as of the date they were commenced. The only step remaining was to endorse a memorandum on title. Alternatively, the Court ought to declare that the caveats were wrongfully installed, a necessary first step in accessing the assurance funds.  3) Even if the caveat had been removed improperly, this Court ought not retroactively reinstate the caveat because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of the indefeasible title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000."

The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence was driving faster that 60 km/hr. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that Mr. Dallyn disputes is that he passed highway workers/occupation highway equipment when he was travelling faster than 30 km/hour. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle. Bradley George Christensen, the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitoring device, testified that he observed the accused driving and that he recorded the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or that he actually was passing highway vehicles or occupied equipment when the speed monitor device recorded its speed. The Court found the accused not guilty. The Crown submits that the offence under the Traffice safety Act is strict liability. The evidence consists of the following documents: 1) a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken and the speed of the motor vehicle when the photograph is taken, which in this case was 84 kms/hr; 2) affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, and the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search. The Act allows the accused to ask for an order requiring Mr. Christensen to attend for the purpose of cross-examination but the accused did not do so; 3) the evidence consisted of a number of documents. The first two were the photographs of the offending vehicle taken by a speed monitor camera showing a date and the time the photographs were taken, the speedometer when it was taken, and its speedometer. The last two were affidavits confirming the service of a Summary Offencing Notice and the photograph. The third was the affidavit of the person in charge of the speed-monitoring device."
7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law.

The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a refund in the amount of $419,964.69 plus interest as alleged in the Third Party Claim. The Court found that even if the Government was not liable to pay the PST, the third party contractors owed the Saskatchewan government PST, in undetermined amounts, on materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was not entitled to refund of PST. 2)The court found in favour of the plaintiff on the basis that it relied on the representations and interpretation of the Government in collecting the PST. 3)The Court found the plaintiff to be in breach of s.50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act. 4)If the Government is liable to refund the PST from the plaintiff, the amount to be refunded to the plaintiff is to be reduced by virtue of the limitation period set forth in s.56 of the Act. 5)The defendants were not liable for the payment of PST by the plaintiff as they did not have the proper licensing and licensing of the contractors. 6)The defendant was not responsible to pay PST on the materials it consumed in performance of its contracts with third parties and the plaintiff properly levied and collected tax on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to s.7(a). The plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the plaintiff and the third-party contractors.

The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants on August l993. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On March 21, 1994 the landlord served the tenants with a notice of the termination of their tenancy. The deputy rentalsman released his decision on May 3, 1994 giving the landlord two letters indicating his desire to sell the premises and his ill health necessitating a sale. The Deputy rentalsman then issued a decision on June 13, 1994 which overturned the landlord's decision to abate the rent. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored. 1)Some deference must be shown to those aspects of the deputy rentalman's decisions which reflect an exercise of discretion.  2)Where the application is made to the landlord, the appellate jurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction.  3)The Court of Appeal's jurisdiction was not restricted to a finding of error of Law or jurisdiction in this matter. The jurisdiction previously given to the RTA had not been given to it. There was no longer full re-hearing on an appeal from the rentalsmans decisions. On this basis, some deference was shown to the aspects that reflect an 'exercise of caution'."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was reduced to four years imprisonment from the original sentence of 10 months served plus two years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition. The Crown appealed the sentence. The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. The court was of the view leave should be granted and the appeal allowed."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench judge, who found that the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider the effect of s.75 of The Queen’s Bench Act, 1998, c. Q-1.01 upon the respondent’ s claim to the RRIF. Dismissing the appeal, that the circumstances did not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence. The circumstances simply did not permit the appellant to continue distributing the funds without proper directions from the court."
8_2005skca27.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. The sheriff had returned the nulla-baint to the debtor's writ on the debtor and the appellant had failed to persuade the court that the appellant erred in any material respect. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed, with costs on appeal to the appellant to be taxed in the usual way."
8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.",HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. The respondent was to pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. The Court found that there was no evidence that one or more of the respondent's children had acquired title to the horses. It was important that she be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible.
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was not ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010. However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs' motions to strike were dismissed. HELD: The defendants' motion to strike was dismissed. 1)It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. The retroactive payment does not form part of the retiree's 2010 income. The retiring employee's pension is accordingly reduced. 2)As with all interlocutory applications for mandatory injunctive relief the plaintiffs must establish that there is a strong prima facie case; secondly, that the Court of Appeal is entitled in certain circumstances to supplement or augment the jurisdiction of other tribunals of exclusive jurisdiction. 3)The court is without jurisdiction to direct an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it. The court is therefore without jurisdiction in the circumstances to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to mandatory injunctions. 4)The defendants’ motion was dismissed with costs."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The exclusion of evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle. As a result of the breaches, the accused is not guilty. The Court excluded the evidence of his wallet and keys. The court found that the breaches were numerous and point to ignorance on the part of the police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and their powers on investigative detention."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. The Board's decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marijuana is not proven and therefore not 'necessary' or'required' might be unreasonable but this is not the case here. The board's decision that it has the power to deny reimbursement meets the standard of reasonableness. Based upon the wording and context of these provisions, it is of the view that the Board’s interpretation that it had the discretion to deny reimbursements is reasonable and it is within the range of “possible acceptable outcomes” of the legislation. The decision falls within the appropriate range of possible outcomes of the law. 1) The Board found that the benefits and safety of medical marijuana have not been established to the point that it is necessary as a result of work related injuries. This conclusion is supported by research and is all the more reasonable when one considers alternative medication. 2) The board found that it exceeded its jurisdiction in enacting Policy Statement of POL 10/2011 to deny the applicant reimbursement for medical marijuana claims in all cases. The applicant argued that the board erred in relying on the submissions of the board's medical consultant and medical department. 3) Based on this wording of S. 106(1) and s. 22(1), the Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra-vires."
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","HELD: The court found that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of The University of Saskatchewan Act and the Act. The court held that the president's personal recommendation to the Board was not required, and the board was not obliged to follow the president’s recommendation before considering an application for tenure submitted by one of the committees assigned the power to recommend pursuant to the Agreement. The arbitrator concluded that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act, but rather an appointment within the meaning of s. 51(a) and the same applies to tenure. The Court held that this was a statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within the University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context."
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1)The accused was granted a stay of execution pending the determination of these issues. 2)The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone. 3)There was no evidence to the contrary that the accused had taken photographs of the complainant while she was naked and showering. The evidence was not included in the ITO. The respondent's testimony in the amplification hearing was to countenance subsequent validation. 4)The respondent's evidence did not appear to be admissible in respect of whether the accused’s Charter rights were violated.
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant, a subdividing developer, sought to have the respondent's land conveyed to the Department of Transportation and Communications.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. The Court held that the Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which on balance would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means.

Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","HELD: The application for a permanent injunction was dismissed. The court found that the evidence did not establish grounds for an injunction at the required threshold and that neither the plaintiff nor the receiver had established irreparable harm. The Court dismissed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that neither applicant had established damages. The plaintiffs relied upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), and Canada v. LeBlanc for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable damage is less vigorous or less telling in cases of a breach of negative covenant. The case for the receiver was much simpler than that for Sobeys and M.C. Leblanc because the landlord is party to the lease and is entitled to enforce the lease as a party. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the receiver's case is to be assessed simply in light of the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms."

The hearing is to proceed on January 6, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. or at such other date and time as counsel may agree upon in consultation with the Local Registrar.  1) The extent of the respondent's right to disclosure of documents and information is limited to what is specified in the enabling statute. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2) It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing. This would seem to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. 3) The respondent's motion was dismissed. 4) The application was without merit and it was not the proper remedy. The motion was not prepared by the counsel for the AG. 5) It follows that the role of the hearing judge is a narrow one, confined to the role specified in an enabling statute and is to determine whether there is a prima facie case that an extradition crime has been committed by the person sought for extradition. The Act does not confer an expanded Charter jurisdiction upon the respondent. The respondent is entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that a fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. The application before the AG was under s.15 of the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced on behalf the respondent, specifically, denial of natural justice. The Deputy Attorney General was granted a stay of proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: contempt of court by the AG for failing to provide proper disclosure; alternatively, the production by the Attorney general of witness statements and other evidence in compliance with the common law duty of procedural fairness as it applies in administrative proceedings; in the further alternative, the disclosure of information pursuant to s. of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed"
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired before the commencement of the spousal relationship between the parties. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court found that the Court erred in finding that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in late June 1994 and that the matter was governed by s.22 rather than s.21 and 23. The Court also found that in light of the gift the appellant had received from his mother, it was far from clear the respondent will ever be required to repay them. It has now been approximately nine years. While the income when he purchased the house in 1996 was perhaps unexceptional, he has had substantial income for the last number of years and made no payments. The court found that it would be unfair and inequitable to allow the respondent to have the property distributed in whole or in part having regard for the provisions of s.23 and s.24 of the act. 2) There were a number of exemptions to which the entitlement to an equal share is also subject. These are found in s. 23 of the Family Property act. These were those found in Mitchell v. Mitchell, supra, and Vilcu v. Grams (1999), 120 Sask.R. 17 (Sask.C.A.). The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v Mitchell in Mitchell (1992), p.231, 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask.) in that it was the Court that found the trial judge to err in concluding that the values of the Vancouver property were not exempt in part because the property was acquired prior to the commencement spousa relationship. 3) The court held that there was sufficient in law to render the relationship between parties spousals, effective as of June 1994, as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23. It is also the Court which held that in principle, the appellant, who acquired the house after the commencement, acquired it after, not before, the commencement. The value of this property did not qualify for exemption under ss. 23(1)(a). 4) There are a number"
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition were imposed. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision and one year probation. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1)The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act.  2)The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to mean that the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offender would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor."
9_2008nssc58.txt,"The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased. Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant, a niece of the testator, is the alternate executor of the estate. The applicant seeks an order removing the executor, who is the husband of the deceased testator and was designated as the sole executor in her will in December 2000. The deceased is a niece and the applicant is the Alternate executor. The applicants claim that the applicant's niece is the only person whose interest is at risk if he fails to properly administer the estate and he is the sole beneficiary of the will. HELD: 1) The application to remove the present executor is dismissed.  2) The applicant has no clear idea of what an executor does. He has no memory of certain events, but appeared to have some recollection of certain dates, but weak grasp of other events. On the equally important second test, however, I am satisfied that Mr. Finlayson himself is not at risk. He is the primary beneficiary.  3) The applicants are entitled to show cause why Royal Bank shares held in her and her husband's names as joint tenants should not be treated as assets of the Estate or, in the alternative, subject to certain trusts. 4) The Court has no difficulty in interposing to remove trustees who have abused their trust. It is my view that, although the applicant has difficulties with vision and hearing and lacks clear understanding of the proceeding, his position as executor and the necessity of due and prompt fulfilment of the duties of his position, he is not the only one who is at a risk. The Court is also satisfied that the respondent's interests are at risk, as evidenced by the fact that he has a mental illness and is unable to perform the duties he is required to perform. 5) The court has no reason to believe that the executors will be in a position to advise the Court as to the proper course of action. 6) There is no evidence to support the application that the Court is satisfied the respondent himself is the first person whose interests are in risk if the applicant fails to administer the Estate. The only person who is a beneficiary is the respondent. 7) In exercising so delicate jurisdiction as that of removing trustees, their Lordships do not venture to lay down any general rule beyond the very broad principle above enunciated, that their main guide must be the welfare of the beneficiaries. 8) In this instance it is appropriate that fix costs."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.

He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed.

The last relief sought is for interim relief that the applicant be reinstated to his studies.  3) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Committee has such power.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit.

The Court held that it was necessary to distinguish between governmental policy decision and operational implementation. It held that a duty to care arises in a particular situation where it is impossible to determine the extent of the damage caused by a tree that fell on a public highway. The law in Canada was recently set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Just v. British Columbia (December 1989) and the Department of Highways and the Attorney General of Canada (DHS).

They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","HELD: The Court found that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, and 11(c)and (d) of the Charter.

Pursuant to the provisions of s. 309 and 311 of the Code, the accused were found guilty of publishing a matter without lawful justification that was likely to injure the reputation of the police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to insult the officer. The accused were accompanied by a number of other persons. The court found that the objectives of s300 and 301 were not of pressing and substantial concern in free and democratic society.

A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appeals from the conviction. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction could be entered. 2)The evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, the offence has been made out. 3)The Stellato decision differs with the marked departure standard. The Stellatos decision differs from the Queen vs. McKenzie decision in that it differs with a marked departure from what is usually considered as the norm. 4)The Court was not able to say that the findings by the judge are not supported by the evidence, or that her conclusions are clearly wrong as to make her decision unreasonable."
b_1996canlii6803.txt,"A claim for wrongful dismissal. The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","This was a claim for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, Inc. from January 1983 to May 1993, at which time she was dismissed. She was a married mother of three children. She had been unemployed for two years. She took a number of steps to mitigate her loss, including turning down an offer of employment from another company for a new and experimental position. She turned down the offer because not only was the salary much lower, the position was temporary and the duties were materially different from those at her job with Gabriel. The defendant was required by law to contribute to the Canada Pension Plan. HELD: The plaintiff's damages were assessed at $26,514.00.  1)Prejudgment interest was awarded to the plaintiff pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act.  2)The plaintiff took all reasonable steps to minimize her loss. She did not fail to mitigate the damages under this head."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","HELD: The Court found the amount of spousal and child support to be reasonable and fair. Given the relative income of the parties as well as current income tax implications, the Court found that the amount was reasonable. The Court ordered transfer by way of rollover of that amount from the respondent's pension plan to the children. 1)Given the economic disadvantage suffered by Mary, the termination and retirement method were the route to go. The court was persuaded by the Grainger v. Grainger case that the combination method is an acceptable method of valuation in this case. 2)The Court was convinced that somewhere in between (preferably the mid-point) the termination/retirement method is the route."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George’s Hill. He arranged to hire an individual to do the backhoe work on the excavation. He did not have proper training and specificguidance and supervision. HELD: The defendant was guilty as charged on all offences. 1)The defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers at the excavation site.  2)If the defendant did have an obligation to discharge it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances, it was in the best interests of all involved.  3)No inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training, supervision and supervision by the defendant.  4)The evidence was clear that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of master and servant or employer and employee."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused appealed his conviction on count two of the Information. HELD: The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction. The appeal was dismissed. 1)The learned judge did not err in his assessment of whether the accused was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle pursuant to s. 258(1) of the Criminal Code. The learned judge accepted and relied on the Crown's evidence of ambulance attendants and police officer over the accused's version of what took place. 2)It was clear from the acceptance of the evidence that the ambulance attendants were the first to come across when they approached the appellant's vehicle to investigate. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The appellant had much different story. He admitted that he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up but the learned judge, even though he appreciated the candid testimony of the two ambulance attendants, clearly accepted the evidence and the police officer's evidence over the other's version."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant, J.D. Irving Limited, doing business under the firm name and style of Kent Building Supplies (herein 'Kent'). The plaintiff operated sole proprietorship known as Markham Contracting which is involved in house renovations through the winter period and landscaping in the summer. When he entered the premises, he did not notice anything located on the side of the contractor's desk. He did however, notice that his knee was swollen with infection and that he had to endure considerable pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $5,000.00 by way of general damages.  1) The evidence as a whole was also clear that the presence of a 'cart' or 'doll' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of the existence of such dollies within the premises. 2) In the context of the present circumstances the realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or impossible, the sum of $1,000 is more than reasonable in the circumstances and such sum is thereby awarded."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The principle question is whether this 1950 Freeholders agreement is void under the common law rule. 2) The Court found that the 'top leases' are not unique or unusual in the oil and natural gas industry. There are hundreds of such leases in this province. The Court was convinced that it was intended by the parties to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. As there was a possibility that the interest would not prevent the development and utilization of the lands, the policy behind the Rule is not offended. 3) The court found that it did not have to consider whether the lease created the interest was void. It was only after the time of vesting had been ascertained that a determination could be made about whether that time was too remote and therefore in contravention of the Rule."
b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The Legislature has denied such a claim to the Estate but has provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Where a person's life is shortened or that he or she has been killed by the defendant's tortious conduct, the estate is entitled to claim damages for loss of expectation of life. 2) The law of Nova Scotia is different from that of England and the USA in that it does not include causes of action, except defamation, seduction and inducing one spouse to leave another, which are not in issue here. 3) The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation was enacted to relieve against specific aspects of the very old common law rule. It was also amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 4) Nova Scotia legislation does not do away entirely with common law for wrongful death actions. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways. 5) The only statute that the appellants rely on is the Fatal Injuries Act. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. However, the Act limits the type of damages which may be recovered by the estate to those which have a reasonable expectation of living. 6) The Court of Appeal concurs. 7) In this case, the Court must determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids. 8) In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these statutory provisions, the court must determine whether the law of law is efficacious, in the sense that it promotes the legislative purpose and that the outcome is reasonable and just."

b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",The applicant applied to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. The application was prompted by the relocation of one of the couple's two children from Kindersley to the Archerwill district in northeastern Saskatchewan. The parties separated in May 2004 when Shauna left the family home with the two children. The primary residence of the children was with Shauna. Shauna had foreclosed the option of returning to live in the Kinderville district. HELD: 1) The applicant was granted access to his father and sister. 2) Access to the mother and sister became more problematic and travel arrangements more difficult. The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. 3) There were negative consequences involved in changing the primary residence. The applicant would be separated from his psychological parent. The special needs of the child require that he have the assistance and support of someone to whom he is closely bonded. The petitioner was granted the sole issue on this variation application. The only viable options at this time are to either permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to Archerwill or to change the primary home of the petitioner by placing him in the home of Rocky. The relocation may actually improve the access attitude of the parents. 4) There are negative consequences in changing Tyson's primary residence to the home where he is currently living. He would be placed in the psychological parent's home. The children would be exposed to a new environment and there would be disruption to the ability of the parties to maintain close relationship with each other and with both parents. The Court reviewed the circumstances prior to making the threshold test and concluded that the move was in the best interests of both parties.

The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.

New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed.

While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.

In effect the appellant made a decision to attend the hearing himself, which appeared suddenly, than to attend.

b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The court found that since the acquisition of the land in 2007, Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land has been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park. The Land was not farm land within the meaning of the SFSA in that it was purchased by a developer for development; was being developed at the time this action was brought, and neither at that time nor since has there been any realistic involvement in farming so as to trigger the provisions of theSFSA and so engaged the plaintiff in this case. The Court found that the purpose of the bidding process in a judicial sale remedy contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that FMI is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price.

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.",HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the extent that it incorporated the Borden driveway. The Court also found that there was considerable and convincing evidence that the plaintiffs in the case had actually used the driveway for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. The plaintiff had failed to show that the access right-of-way that ran from the original driveway to the Bordens driveway was or incorporated the existing driveway.

J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","HELD: The order was made under s. 23 of the Child and Family Services Act. The parents were not able to care for the child. The plan was to return the infant to the parents' care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandmother TK and a friend of her's. The child had been in the care of the grandparents for most of his life and was in need of protection. The mother was not a person of sufficient interest. The father was in a physically abusive domestic relationship and the mother was mentally ill. The children were in need and the parents did not have access to the child's social and emotional needs.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). HELD: The transcript could now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date was confirmed. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances.  1) The Act provides wide discretion to justice, always acting judicially, to do that which is required to be done to ensure justice is achieved between the parties. 2) The Court of Appeal in Ballantyne Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 2015 SKCA 38 (CanLII), 457 Sask 254 has recently provided guidance with respect to proper statutory interpretation. The respondent rests his argument on the provisions of ss. 39 of the Act. It appears for an appellant to “file the transcript” there is no action required beyond the request to Transcript Services. That agency then prepares the transcript and files it with the court. In that case, the court may make any order that the judge considers appropriate. 3) The transcript may be filed without the appellant having done anything incorrectly. There is no order on the part of the Court of Queen’s Bench that will not lead to absurdities. 4) In the circumstances where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this Court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice was done as between the Parties. This discretionary remedy is consistent with intention of the s39(9). That subsection provides for remedy in the event transcript cannot be provided for the appeal. This is part of s39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of transcript and the failure to file within the 6 month provision, through a no fault. In the case of the respondent, the Court may make 'any other order' that the Judge considers appropriate.' 5) The provisions of s.39 of the act are designed to cause the appellant to perfect its appeal. It provides for the manner in which an appeal is commenced; what must be set forth on the notice of appeal; and how to perfect the appeal by the filing of transcript of evidence from the trial. The appellant is entitled to file the transcript for its use and for forwarding to the respondent. In this case, it is entitled, s.47 provides the authority to now allow the transcript to be filed."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the complainant's witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. He also submitted the sentence was unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The appellant had the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice. The trial judge failed to establish that the appellant's evidence of credibility was supportedable on the evidence. 2) The evidence must meet the criteria for admission as set out in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 3) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. It was well understood in this case that an appellant must show great deference to a judge's assessments of the witness credibility in order to impose a custodial sentence. The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission and the sentencing judge was properly instructed. The conviction appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed is varied to 12 months of probation."

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant the adjournments and the consequent verdict. The Court applied the framework for review from Barrette The Queen to Ironchild, where the accused's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an adjournment to obtain counsel for the sentencing hearing. The trial judge stepped down for ten minutes to consider the request. When he returned, he advised that the next available trial date was almost a year away. The judge checked to see if another judicial centre could offer an earlier trial date. He denied the adjournment request. The accused appealed. Appeal allowed. The decision was based on reasons well-founded in the law. In this case, the Court found that the decision was made in the light of the realities of each case consistent with the interests of justice."

Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour.

The Court was also satisfied that there was no possibility of reconciliation.  1)The Court was left with the task of determining the effect of the marriage in impairing or improving each spouse's future economic prospects and attempting to achieve an equitable sharing of the economic consequences of a marriage breakdown. 2)The court found that the marriage should adopt a philosophy of interspousal maintenance that does not tend to compel sexually-determined mode in which marriage functions are divided, leaving it to the market place of social custom as to how individuals will arrange their lives. 3)The respondent had made substantial non-economic contributions to their marriage and suffered an economic disadvantage on a marriage break-up."

c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT: An application pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court for a determination of these points of law. HELD: 1)The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. Oppositely, the Highway Traffic Act is specifically directed to liability arising from motor vehicle negligence. Therefore, the specific creates an exception to the general, and negligent teacher/driver, even acting within the scope of s. 228 of the Education Act, is liable for the injury to the plaintiff pupil. The Education Act ensures that the school board is liable to the same amount as the driver because he is prevented from suing the driver. Even if there were an apparent conflict between the two statutes, the legislation provides that negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the same s. 86(1) of The Highway Traffic act. The teacher's immunity only applies to the owner of the motor vehicle. This is not an issue in this case. 2)There was no apparent conflict with the statutes. When they are read together, the Act provides that a negligent teacher, who is granted the same immunity as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1), is only liable to that same amount. This principle of construction is not construed as repealing the general law but as providing an exception."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The Court granted relief of a general nature that the meaning of the order is uncertain. 1) The Court failed to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2) The respondents were seeking details of the plaintiffs' investigation and that information is protected by litigation privilege. 3) There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to a question of this nature when reference is made to document. The Court was not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses. 4) The questions were asked whether SPMc's insurer's investigation team participated in the investigation of the Kelsey fire. The answer to that question requires an expert opinion which the plaintiff is not required to provide. 5) The court was asked what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. 6) The question asked was 'what observations were observed of the damages post fire?' The plaintiff was asked whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC. The plaintiff replied that he did not know. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to know what observations the plaintiff gave as a result of the fire, whether the plaintiffs had any position on the matter, and if so, what chemical change took place. The plaintiffs were not entitled at the discovery stage to the name of the plaintiff's expert opinion on the burn pattern. The question was asked 'what portion of the wall had torch application?' The plaintiffs refused to answer on the ground that names of potential witnesses were not discoverable. The order cannot stand. The only thing that would make an expert's opinion relevant is the fact that the plaintiffs are not entitled in any way to know the exact location of the appellant's investigation. It would be another matter if the plaintiffs were in the building at the time the fire started. There is no obligation on the plaintiffs to seek facts when they ask for this information; he is seeking details. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. The defendants are entitled to all relevant facts but not opinions. The questions can only be answered by having experts reconstruct"
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is limited to acts occurring after the proclamation of the Crown Liability Act. The Attorney General acknowledges that Helen Greyeyes was employed at the Residential School from 1927 to 1969. The parties agree that she died in 1988. The 12 month limitation period in the POPA applies to claims arising from acts occurring prior to the date the claim was made. 2) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior a certain time period. The answer to this question must be in the present state of the law. 3) Although the decision in [R.J.G.] is consistent with various other decisions, the Attorney General is not the only one to argue that the 12 month time limitation period under s.2(1)(a) of the POPa should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the Act."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","HELD: The respondent was awarded spousal support of $10,000. The court found that the respondent was entitled to lump sum spousa support of the amount suggested by the respondent. The Court found that, considering their present financial position, there was a need and ability to pay, the respondent should be entitled to support and there was capacity to pay support. The respondent's income had declined significantly since the separation and the Court was not satisfied that the lump sum was the appropriate level of support. As the respondent had no children of her own, the Court found the respondent's need for spousals was greater than that of a lump sum."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The Applicant sought a taxation of the accounts issued to the Respondent. The Respondent, who represented herself at the taxation hearing, argued that the respondent was negligent with regard to the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of a matrimonial home to the estranged spouse of the respondent's estranged spouse. HELD: 1) The respondent's motion for recusal was granted. The Court found no indication whatsoever of overbilling whether with respect to the respondent. The respondent admitted that she was 'overbilled.' The Court also found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the appellant. 2) There was no evidence of over-billing in the Act. The evidence regarding the time limitation of cross-examination was sufficient to warrant a recusal order. 3) The Court reviewed all of the time entries and found no such evidence. 4) Having reviewed the time-limitations, it is difficult to see why the respondent would not have immediately asked the appellant why she went to Crownside. The appellant freely admitted (without any prompting) that the appellant was convicted of the criminal charges laid against her. Those convictions obviously impact negatively on the appellant's credibility. 5) There is very little in the Small Claims Court Act, supra, which specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court of Appeal. There is a strong presumption in favour of judicial impartiality. The presumption is that such a prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension of prejudice."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The Crown appealed the sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, the fact that they were working for a criminal organization and their motivation was financial gain. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders.  2)The court found that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to 4 years and that the personal circumstances of an accused, while not to be ignored, are secondary considerations to the issues of deterrence and denunciation."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1), naming of two classes of persons who owned property within stated radius (Property Owner Class) and (2) persons who resided within that radius for minimum period after January 5, 1968 (Residential Class). The defendants filed an amended motion for certification, that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area but extended 7 year habitation requirement for the residential class. The plaintiffs sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants, alleging that the Steel Works emitted lead, arsenic, PAH's and other toxins. The defendants appealed the certification order, arguing that the stay would cause irreparable harm. Dismissing the motion for stay, that the Court of Appeal's decision is not arguable on its face and there is no evidence that the Province's grounds of appeal are arguable. HELD: The appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the defendant. It is premature to comment on the merits of the third assumption."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the defendant's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the discovery subpoena was an abuse of process and that the circumstances justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant. The Defendant argued that this motion was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. HELD: The defendant sought an increase of costs for party and party costs.  1)The circumstances and factual findings justified an increased tariff for the defendant, D.R. Breton Limited. 2)The defendant did not take any position on exclusion of witnesses, as that was not what it was seeking. 3)The use of subpoenas in this matter should be frowned upon. In fixing the amount, the Court's dissatisfaction should be expressed. 4)The issuing of discovery subpoenas (which in effect dictated the order of the witnesses) made exclusion a mute issue. The Plaintiff did not have any authority for the proposition to exclude the Defendant's representative from the discovery of the Plaintiff's witnesses, which was not contrary to the Trans Canada case. The prevailing practice is different (in the view of the plaintiff's counsel) than what was suggested by the Defendant. The Court should consider whether further costs should be awarded having regard to the plaintiff’s pre-motion brief. 5)The Court reviewed the circumstances of the motion and found that the defendant did take some steps to abuse the rule. The circumstances and the factual findings warranted an increase to the tariff. The court was mindful of the factors that led to this decision. The parties agreed initially that Rule 18.16 was applicable. The order for payment of costs in the amount of $750 was in keeping with the length of the hearing and the defendant should have made the motion to determine the order for discovery."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and was found to be a high risk to re-offend violently in the future. HELD: The Court found that the offender was a high-risk to reoffend violent and sexually violently in future and this risk was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. 1) It is an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. 2) What circumstances might exacerbate the individual's risk for violence? The Court reviewed the offender's criminal history and found that he is a high high risk. The court reviewed the respondent's current situation and found it was reasonable to conclude that he was at high risk for re-occurrence. The respondent was given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning via such programming. The judge concluded that the respondent was a 'high risk' to re‑offend and that his risk to continue to perpetrate violent crimes in the community would be mitigated by the use of learning alternative methods of venturing his frustration. The Judge concluded that if the offender had a reasonable release plan, he would be in a much better position to do so. 3) The Court concluded that there was a pattern of offending in this way which was mitigating only if the respondent conscientily applies himself the alternative ways to vent his anger and frustration."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"HELD: The application for court appointed counsel was dismissed. The court found that the accused had not demonstrated the necessary financial acumen to proceed with a trial on the noted offence and that his court appointed court appointment had expired. The Court found that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s.24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to fair trial. The subtle but critical issue of the difference between possession of substance for the purposes of a trial and possession of a weapon is also raised. The accused was to be personally present at the pre-trial conference."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. Both parties sought to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year. He was in excess of $10,000 in arrear support obligation. The mother sought sole custody of the two children because she is the only one providing for the children and is the sole one parenting the children.

The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal) was reviewed and reinstated on an interim basis. There were numerous errors made by the Tribunal, including the suspension of the Senior Medical Officer (SMO). The Tribunal did err in some respects, but the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges. The Tribunal made fatal errors in reviewing the SMO's decision, which ultimately resulted in the suspension. The appellant's position is in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act."

The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.",HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the parties had a prima facie right to partition and sale of the lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother and sister. The Court found that there was no evidence to support the argument that the partition order would cause inconvenience and hardship to the parties. The respondents argued that the remedy of constructive or resulting trust would give them collectively an interest in the property greater than 50%. The court reviewed the evidence and found that it was not s.2 of the Act but s.4 of the Code.

The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. There was also an incident where a small paddle was employed and she had been struck with a cookie box. No injury had ever resulted from the assaults. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant. 1)The trial judge must have been influenced to a substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in the manner he did. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury. 2)The sentence of two years under the circumstances was excessive. The Crown and defence recommended fine and probation, but the trial judge was of the view that some degree of incarceration is appropriate given the position of authority he enjoyed and the existence of his past criminal record even though it does not include similar instances of violence."

The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.",The plaintiff was granted an option to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility.

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and he was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares. The trial judge found that the appellant should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for leave from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision dated October 25, 1996. It is limited to a question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal as an appeal from the hearing officer. The basis for dismissing the appellant's appeal was the Tribunal's conclusion that the Hearing Officer did not arrive at a decision which was patently unreasonable. The Tribunal employed the following language in expressing this conclusion: do not find it patently reasonable that the hearing Officer found that the inference the Worker was seeking was not a reasonable one. The inference being sought by the worker is that his knee problem arose out of and in the course of his employment. The medical evidence did not support the inference that the worker was seeking.

d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant Royal Bank of Canada and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under a Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the respondent received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The plaintiff defended and counter-claimed against the defendant for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by an amendment application made at trial, and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim against Royal Bank was dismissed.  2) The evidence from all of the facts and circumstances was that the Royal bank did not act in bad faith or in breach of its fiduciary or contractual obligation towards the respondent. The Royal bank expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information.  3) There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all the facts, that persons using and relying upon the information would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. 4) The court concluded that the relationship between the Royal and Compain was not a breach of their contractual obligation, duty or duty to the respondent, and that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P-3 existed. 5) In conclusion none of the counter-claimant's claims are upheld and they are dismissed in total. 6) In the alternative, the plaintiff's counter-suit against the bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages was taxed."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant's present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. HELD: Appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the respondent, and recognizing that a pre -existing condition was the major cause of his present medical problems, the trial Judge assessed the respondent's general damages at $25,000. This was a finding that was so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly incorrect estimate of damages."

The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.

HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. 1)The appellant did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers. The appellant was doing well in all programs in prison. 2)The respondent did not have a criminal record. She had no criminal record and was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges. 3)The Crown did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that the sentence be proportionate. The respondent did have a previous record of violent behaviour. 4)The sentence of 2½ year was increased by this Court to the equivalent of more than ten years. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no prior record; (b) she did not participated in the physical beating, stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (c) she seems to be doing well. 5)She did not contribute to the physical and stabbing and was not involved in the other assaults."

The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child, rather than to make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift.

d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.

The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly.

The defendants deny that this transaction was loaned to the plaintiff and her husband, and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff into that auto broker business.

The evidence from the plaintiff was that she chose to pay for another vehicle instead of deducting that amount from what was owed. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. In fact, the only evidence which might suggest this transaction could be a loan was the testimony of the defendant's witness who testified that she did not make the decision to pay the plaintiff the money.

The child had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. The matter came back before the CFS Tribunal with the recommendation of the psychological report. The minister sought to appeal the order. The Minister appealed the order on the grounds that to grant leave to the appellant on this extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal. It was clear from the very meaning of the word 'transition' and the wording of the order, that the minister is to retain status as parent with the attendant decision-making authority until the transition is complete and the child is returned to the custody of the father. This period is subject to a number of conditions reflecting the recommendations in the report and is not material to this application. 2)The Minister made an order pursuant the s.37(1)(a) that the child be returned to his father, subject to these conditions. The order was fraught with ambiguity for it was unclear whether, during the transition period, the Minister retains status as a parent until the Transition is complete, but only of viva voce evidence, which was filed by the agreement of the parties and was not subject to cross-examination. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the issue was of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal."

The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. The respondent appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal which held that the respondent's IRB should not be less than the IRB calculated for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The respondent was found to have correctly calculated his IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and reduced the net income to 90%. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. 1) The respondent's income replacement benefit (IRB) was reduced by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would not be a rational or fair interpretation of deducting income tax and employment insurance premium from only part-time employees. 2) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the Act is to be calculated in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. The Act is intended to correlate a non-earner's income with his or her earning reality. The provisions of s. 135 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. 3) The hearing judge found that SGI had correctly calculated the respondent’s IRB. The Court held that it would be both a rational and fair interpretation for SGI to deduct the income tax of employment insurance, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada) and Canada pension contributions from the only full time earners. The legislation attempts to find the non-income as a non profit. The court also held that s. 117(3) is subservient to the other provisions of this Division. The wording of the Regulations is too restrictive. 4) The court found that the phrase “subject to the Other provisions of the Division” as meaning “governed by” or “affected by the other” is inconsistent with the “weighted average approach” used by SGI. The phrase,'subject to', may mean'subservient’ or'subordinate to' but that is a too restrictive definition of the phrase. The law is designed to be designed to find an earning reality, poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning reality and the legislation attempts"

HELD: Interim injunction granted. 1)The plaintiff was facing serious threat to its business and it had reasonable argument that this Court should examine the situation and perhaps intervene. The Interlocutory Injunction motion was not frivolous or vexatious. 2)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company - the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test. The balance of convenience favored the defendant. 3)The hearing of the interlocutor was full and consider all of the evidence. There was no compromise on the part of the Justice who would ultimately hear the motion."

After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","HELD: The judgment was granted in favour of the defendants in the amount of the Admin Fees charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants. The court ordered that the judgment be final and that any dispute regarding the amount should be decided by the chambers judge. The parties were to contact the Registrar in order to arrange a time for argument on any points in debate. There were no specific objections nor any specific objections. The defendants object to the request by SGE that the court finalize judgment as contemplated by the paragraphs 103, 104, 113 and 114 of the original judgment. The respondents were to leave to the parties the clerical task of finalizing the calculation of the judgment. In the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement on what the judgment amounts to from the above formula, the court will have to consider the merits of the appeal."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the Plaintiff. The trial Judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. The proper test is whether his conduct denied the defendant fair trial or gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. 2) There was no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's assessment of the evidence and his interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the information regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the judge could understand it. As the Plaintiff was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in a traditional civil trial."

The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of Queen's Bench. This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear this appeal when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Psychologists act does not explicitly state that an appeal lies to the Court of Queen’s Bench when the legislature enacted The Psychologist Act, 2000. 2)The psychologists Act is silent on the question of when right of appeal lies. It states that 'an appeal lies only to the court of Queen's Bench.'  3)HELD: This was an error to construe s. by asking first whether The Psychology Act “confers only limited right” within the meaning of s. 7(2)(a) of The Interpretation Act. Section 7(3) states that “An appeal lies from a Queen” Bench decision.  4)Section 7(5) of the Psychologists’ Act states that there was no appeal to Queen‘s Bench. 5)The Psychologyologists Act, and its predecessors, dating back to the Psychologist and Psychologists Acts, only tangentially concern the issue of when a judge of the court is not sitting as persona designata so as to narrow the circumstances when rightof appeal will not exist. The psychologists act provides that the Court does not have a right to appealed from the decision of a council to the Queen“s Bench, but that does not limit the member”s right of appeals from that Court to this one. 6)The psychologist Act does provide that the court has a general jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the Court. The psychologist Act provides that a member of the Court may appeal from any decision of that court to this court. The Court of Appeal Act 2000 provides that s7(2) is an enactment that confers only a limited right of appealed. The court has two choices. The legislature could provide that it is a court that is specifically granted to the Crown by an enactment, or the legislature could spell out the general jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but it requires more than silence in the other enactment to take away the general right."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about Dr. Graham in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation as a result of the publication of these articles. The defendants did not publish any retraction or apology nor did they remove the alleged offensive articles from their websites. The court found no prejudice to the plaintiff if the statements of claim are amended to add Postmedia as defendant. The Court also found that Postmedia was the successor to Canwest and at the time of trial, was the owner of the StarPhoenix newspaper. The StarPhoenix published an article entitled “The Judge’s Statement of Claim” which alleged that the plaintiff had been negligent and that the defendant was entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control if the articles were found to be untrue."

Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property pursuant to the provisions of The Matrimonial Property Act and maintenance for the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act.

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property.

Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property.

There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.

The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT.

On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3).

The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.

The events surrounding the arrest involved the police arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for being intoxicated in public place. The actions of the defendant outside the lounge are not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. HELD: 1) Credibility is that the defendant's actions amount to obstruction. 2) The defendant's evidence that the officer physically interfered with the plaintiff and that the plaintiff physically resisted arrest. 3) There is no evidence of physical interference by the defendant with the police. The defendant was not physically involved with the arresting officers at any time prior to the arrest and the action of the officers. 4) There are no reasonable force provisions of the Criminal Code applied or does s. 10(3) of the Police Act apply."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants deny that the plaintiff has any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim, or that the Beveridges have any obligation or obligation to the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares'. The effect of granting a judgment does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2).  2) There is no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiff’s investment in the defendant corporation. The only issue is whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the corporation is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due.  3) The court is of the view that s34 of The Business Corporations Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect is that granting the judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not leave the corporation a position that breaching the prohibition. 4) The amount sought to be recovered does not represent debt or liquidated demand as that phrase is contemplated in Rule 129(2) of the Act. 5) Peak is prohibited by subsection 34(2)(Saskatchewan) from making any payments to redeem its preferred shares. 6) The Court is mindful of the fact that there is no defence to the action on the merits. 7) There are no other shareholders in the capital stock of the defendant and none that would have right to be paid on redemption or in liquidation, rateably with or prior to the Plaintiff as holder of the preferred shares and 8. The Court has considered the matter of Ms. Fehr‘s assertion that only small portion of her investment is owed by the defendant. 8) The Act doesn’t require the defendant to “make any payments” or to ‘redeem’ any of the shares. 9. The court has not shown that the corporate defendant has good defence to, or ought to be permitted to defend the action.  10) The application"

She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned.

She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. HELD: The action could not succeed for the reasons listed above. The Court could not find clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the defendant clearly indicated request for final billing. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town."

e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. It could be because the enterprise was itself unlawful, or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm. The defendant was clearly liable for a trespass as the plaintiff was not aware of the nature of the trees. The plaintiff was entitled to costs of $174.13 for the issuance of the claim plus $100.00 for service. The court awarded damages against the defendant for the actions of the defendant and $3,750 for the damage to the plaintiff's septic field."

The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.",HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault and assault causing bodily harm. The elements required for self defence were not present. The complainant swore that she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room began. The defendant claimed that the complainant was the bigger drinker and drug user and that she pushed him to buy cocaine. The evidence showed that the defendant had punched the complainant several times in the face and that he physically prevented her from doing so. The Crown had proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt and found the defendant guilty of unlawful confinement.

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of four counts. The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was guilty. The accused had acted in a manner that was contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The court found that there was no evidence that the Court believed the accused had motive to lie or that he would allow the father that molested the victim to reside in a home with his young daughter present. The evidence suggested that the court believed that the evidence suggested the accused intended the victim receive the communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, rather than the sexual assault allegations."

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide samples of his breath for analysis contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges. 1)The issue before court is whether there were pedals on the accused's GiO bike. The Crown has failed to prove on February 26, 2010 that the motor vehicle was operating as defined in the Code and that the accused should be acquitted. 2)The accused is guilty of driving while disqualified. The issues before the Court is whether theGiO cycle is a motor car. The accused is acquitted of the charge of impaired driving. 3)The Crown must prove that Mr. Rookes was operating motor vehicle on the evening of February 26 2010. The Court must also prove that the defendant was operating a motor motor vehicle in the evening. 4)The Court must decide whether there are any pedals on Gary Rooks' GiO bicycle. The evidence of the RCMP officer who observed the accused stumble and sway from side to side while driving the moped is consistent with the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike."

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had been convicted of sexual interference on a minor and had two previous convictions for assault. The offences occurred while the accused was on social assistance. The complainant was the friend of the accused's step-daughter and the accused had a back problem. The Court of Appeal found that the accused presented a low risk to re-offend, either generally or sexually, and that he had no prior record for sexual offences. Aggravating factors included lack of remorse, sleeping complainant, and small degree of violence. The court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips and Holgates and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The Court found that the action between Pearce-Ell and Holgate pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. 2) The court applied the Martin principles and presumptions to the matter. The Court held that it was not the job of the lawyer to pass on to the client the information that was imparted to the lawyers in that law firm. 3) There was no delay. 4) In this case, the Court applied the Rule 2.04(10) test to determine whether the lawyer is ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against former clients in the same or any related matter. It was also held that the law firm had failed to rebut the presumption that confidential information imparted by the plaintiffs imparted confidential information to its lawyers. 5) In circumstances where a lawyer purports to conduct litigation adverse to the former client in relation to a matter connected to the first retainer, a simple affidavit contesting the client's assertions will rarely suffice. 6) There is a risk the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of that client. 7) In the present circumstances, the actions of the plaintiffs and the Holgins pertained to the term of the agreed-upon sale, or the very much related matter (the tenancy agreement). The Court was of the opinion that the Holgs had failed in rebutting that presumption. 8) In these circumstances, a reasonable person in the position of party with knowledge of all the facts would reasonably form the belief that the lawyer was acting for a particular party. In such a situation, a disqualification is automatic.  9) The action between the Holgate and the plaintiffs pertains only to the agreed terms of their agreement and the relationship is sufficiently related to the retainer under challenge. The lawyer cannot compartmentalize his or her mind so as to be a rebuttable presumption arises in favour of the former. The same result is achieved by applying the Phillips & Co. law firm to the situation. The court held that a solicitor-client relationship exists between the parties, and that it is to be viewed from the vantage point of the client not the lawyer"
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"HELD: The Court found that the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for a police officer's suspicion that the detained driver had alcohol in his body. The accused was acquitted of both charges. The Court reviewed the meaning of the s. 24(2) Charter remedy and concluded that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. The trial judge specifically found that Cst. Kowalenko relied only upon three factors: the appellant's nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the officer what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning. The court found that this was a finding of fact and that there was no basis for disturbing it. The evidence was reliable, relevant and necessary for the Crown's case and the time of the incident was only relevant to the extent it provides context to the other factors."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of the mortgaged land is a partial appraisal. The partial appraisal does not provide the necessary information to support the plaintiff's position. Therefore, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. The court reviewed the proposed order nis for judicial sales and found that the proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff’s own counsel."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in the approach he took to measure the appellant's use of force, and in disregarding the evidence of the police officer. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was reinstated. 1) The trial judge properly focused on the only issue to be decided, i.e., whether the force used by the appellant was necessary to either defend himself under s. 34(1) of the Code or effect the arrest of Mr. Stonechild. 2) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding ss. 25(1), 34(2) and 35(1). It found that the appellant had made a number of errors as he transformed the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry into a purely objective test. The trial court erred by failing to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was objectively reasonable. The Court found that in assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the officer was justified in kicking the appellant in the abdomen, causing him to fall backwards and injure his head. The appellant could not be expected to measure his force used with exactitude. 3) Leave was granted, the appeal is allowed, the conviction of the appellant entered in the Provincial Court is reinstated. 4) There are principles set out in our law which govern the use of Force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest and they apply to police officers. The law provides for a flexible or tolerant approach to the objective measure of whether force is proportionate. It is open to him to review the video in detail and draw his own conclusions."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of The Child and Family Services Act. The accused was also charged with breach of probation by failing to keep the peace and good behaviour. HELD: The Court found that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant's apartment suite to apprehend the father of the children. The Court also concluded that the officer did have a warrant under s. 13.1 of the Child andFamily Services Act allowing her to enter, but that she had no such warrant and had never utilized a warrant before."

The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and care or control of motor vehicle. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until some thirty-five minutes later. The delay was unreasonable and the accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer concluded within seconds of encountering the accused that he had reasonable suspicion for an ASD demand. He made the demand before asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. The officer could have acted in a more expeditious manner. HELD: The accused's s. 258(1)(c) Charter right was violated. 1) There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time from arrival at the station to the time the tests were taken. This delay may have prejudiced the accused. 2) The accused had to be booked, she wished to use the washroom, she spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel and it was necessary to comply with the observations periods. A rudimentary, or even a perfunctory perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the video-taped interaction between the accused and the officer at the outset."
