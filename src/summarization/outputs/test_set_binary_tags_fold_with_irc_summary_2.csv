The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT.

e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: Leave was granted, the appeal was allowed and the conviction of Constable Power entered in the Provincial Court is reinstated. 1) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and 34(1), and found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. His reasons for this decision were to disregard the evidence of the appellant and to err by applying the wrong standard of reasonableness. 2) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the evidence and the trial judge's reasons for his decision. Rather, he did err in considering the nature and extent of the assault, the harm sought to avoid, and the characteristics of the parties involved in terms of size, strength, age and other immutable characteristics. In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. He should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force use with exactitude. The Court in Nasogaluak also stated that the appeal court judge fell into error and misinterpreted s. 34 of the Code. 3) In determining whether force is reasonable in all the circumstances a judge must first consider the nature, extent, and impact of the impact the force had on the victim. In this case, the appellant's belief must also be reasonable on the basis of the situation he or she perceives. It necessarily follows that verdict of not guilty must be entered. 4) The court found that it was common ground that the principles set out in the Code governing the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest apply to police officers.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge.

d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge's comments and interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the trial judge could understand it. As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in a traditional civil trial. The proper test is whether his conduct denied the defendant a fair trial or gave rise to reasonable apprehension of bias. 2) There is no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and the Court would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as well. 3) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only the rotten condition of the beam but also the cracks in it, could have been discovered by Hancock or his property inspector. While there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete grade beam, Mr. Aubin testified that rotten triple-ply beam had been problem for over ten years. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  4) In the case of Kitzul v. Ungar (1991), 1991 CanLII 7678 (SK QB), 90 Sask.R. 239, [1991] S.J. No. 24 (QL) (Q.B.), the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to, and must, seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment.

In either case, the Circumstantial Evidence of Opportunity is sufficient to support a conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.  3)In either case the procedural point was supported in part by the fact that the appellant had failed to present an argument first when there was no evidence called by them.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.

In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office early in 1994 for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On the same day the landlord served the tenants with a notice of the termination of rent, the deputy rentalsman heard them in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.'s written judgment. The Deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's application for possession was rendered May 13, 1994. This decision displays the animosity which continued to exist between the landlord and tenant. There is no longer a full re-hearing on an appeal from the landlordsman's decisions. On this basis, some deference must be shown to those aspects of the landlord’s decisions which reflect an exercise of discretion.

In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT. This is an application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, requiring the respondents, 101138096 Saskatchewan Ltd. or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of equipment, namely, a 1996 Ingersoll-Rand Roller, a 2005 cat skid steer loader, and a 2008 Trailmax TRD.

The security interest perfected by possession when the secured party seized or repossessed the collateral and is not perfected by registration unless financing statement relating to the security interest and containing description of the goods by serial numbers is registered.  3)The security interest was perfected when it attached and all steps required for perfection pursuant to this Act have been completed, regardless of the order of occurrence. The secured party may propose to take the collateral in a satisfaction of the obligation secured by registration for the purposes of subsection (1), (7), (8), (9), (10) or (12) or if a financing statement is in compliance with s. 59(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act.  4)The applicant registered both British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by a Serial number on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by the serial number. [5]The security agreement was taken by the applicant to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head.

b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on the divorce based on their separation in excess of one year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. While the liability of the respondent to pay maintenance for the children was not disputed, the parties were not fully agreed as to the quantum of the maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: The amount of maintenance was to be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines and the respondent's gross yearly income as determined by the court was $53,000.00. 1)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child. This amount was in the ballpark and while somewhat below, is close to the amount recommended by the Guidelines. 2)The parties had investments valued at approximately $15,000 at the date the action was commenced. The parties were to have a marriage of an approximate duration of 15 years. The respondent indicated during his testimony that even if Mary had received more than he did, he did not intend to pursue his claim for equalization of household goods. 3)There was no consistent approach as to which valuation method should be used, presumably because of the varied factual circumstances in the cases presented to the Court. 4)The Court was persuaded that somewhere in between (preferably the midpoint) the termination and retirement method is the route to go.","At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the breathalyzer test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis pursuant to s254(3). The accused was not qualified to give expert testimony concerning the absorption and elimination of alcohol as well as the calculation of blood/alcohol concentration and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only remedy was stay of proceedings and award costs.  1) The Court of Appeal reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that R. v. Bourget concerned the requested production of ampoules representative of those used in analyzing the breath samples of the accused. The request was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay and with genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the Defence constituted a violation of s. of the Charter of Rights. 2) It is the Court's practice to wait minutes to insure that there is no mouth alcohol to dissipate before administering the roadside screening. However, it does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoule. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution and be sure of its truth is to conduct a breath analysis. There is no such thing as a 'live issue' as the accused was denied his right to counsel.","The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)).

3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial.

Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences."

Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the Homeowners for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their home, including coverage for their Swarovski collection. The appellant prepared the HomePak application for cancellation of the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. Unknown to the appellant, the appellant had arranged for coverage outside of that which is usually provided for in the policy. SGI issued the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. The trial judge concluded that SGI was negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the homeowners, which he assessed at $7,739 (U.S.), pre-judgment interest and GST, if payable. He also concluded SGI contributed equally to the loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The appellant was found liable for failing to provide coverage beyond what is understood by, and applied for by, SGI. 2) SGI did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents. The defendant was not liable to the insurer where the broker failed to convey information relating to changes in the risk or amended conditions to the applicant, or for the application for renewal coverage that he completed for the applicant that he preferred to obtain. His actions constituted negligence at law. 3) There is no general duty on the insurer to issue coverage in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by the appellant. There are no special circumstances which warrant the creation of a 'new duty' to be imposed on it.","Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners.

8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that it was not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive adjustment payments before the end of the 2010 calendar year. The plaintiff union submitted that the essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which, in accordance with the CBA, were beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The defendants responded with motions to strike and dismiss the statement of claim pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 of The Queen's Bench Rules on the ground the essential issue raised concern the terms of employment. The plaintiffs also submitted that there might be irreparable harm for some employees, an example of which was provided to the plaintiffs in the evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs. HELD: 1)The court was without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the principles of CBA and the Weber principle. 2)It is not appropriate for the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to make retroactive adjustments before the beginning of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 3)As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it, I am of the view that I am without jurisdiction. As the court was not satisfied with the pleadings and the evidence before me to meet the applicable test, the court must consider the essential issues in the context of this case. There may well be a serious issue to be arbitrated but for the purposes of the present application I find that it is not adequately framed in pleadings, evidence before the court, to meet that applicable test. 4)The plaintiffs have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than two weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. Nothing is necessary in the meantime to meet this test.","The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year.

HELD: 1) Because the offence of assault is a serious personal injury offence as defined in Part XXIV of the Code, the Crown applied for an order that JR.S. be declared a 'dangerous offender'. 2) The Court reviewed the principles of sentencing and found that the accused was neither dangerous nor long-term offender. 3) The court found that it had the discretion not to designate the offender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate sentence, even in circumstances where the less restrictive sanction under the provisions of s.753.1 may be imposed. 4) The accused had a history of breaching no contact conditions and was found to be in breach of the terms of his probation. 5) Because of the serious nature of the offences which bring about dangerous offender application, incarceration will generally be the result for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders alike.  6) The Crown was not required to be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the offender's risk in the community.

Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path.

Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard.

HELD: The Court found that the defendant did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused the defendant to fall off the work platform. The defendant was fined $8,050. The Court reviewed other cases in occupational health and safety prosecutions and found that considerable degree of restraint was required to achieve a measured response for an appropriate sentence.  1) The defendant had a duty to properly supervise the labourer and to inspect the guardrails before work was commenced in that area. He made an error in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case. 2) Looking at those cases compared to this case and bearing in mind principles of proportionality and parity, the defendant was negligent in his inspection of the work area before work commenced and for some reason that worker did not do so. The failure of the worker to do as he was directed to do and the error in judgment in believing the steel was sufficient for that purpose went to increase the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the defendant.

Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for R and E.C.S. gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicants had not made sufficient progress to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. There was no evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting courses or parenting counselling. The applicants' parenting was abysmal. Although other parenting services are available, it is unlikely that these services will benefit them sufficiently.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children.

The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years ago, the two year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.  2) Even if the time limitation period in s. 2(1)(d)(i) of the LAA applies to claims arising from the conduct of two deceased employees of the Residential School, the plaintiffs are exempt from this limitation period. 3) The 12 month limitation period under s. 3(1(d)(h) of The LAA does not apply to the claim of negligence, breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty arising from acts committed by the Crown servants, agents, and employees. The limitation period explicitly begins to run '... from the discovery of the cause of the action'. 4) The Attorney General argues that the twelve-month limitation period is the only vehicle available for bringing an action against the Crown in right of Canada in provincial court. 5) Counsel for the Attorney General argued the twelve month limitation should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the Act. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada and Missionary Oblates-Grandin Province.  6) The only matter that is before the Court is the bare question of law and in any event conclude that the Crown is generally liable in tort.  7) Although the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Government for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to the date the Act was signed into law, the fact that the plaintiff was physically assaulted while he was in a relationship of dependency with the perpetrators of the assaults is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial.  8) The twelve month limit period in the POPA is set aside by s3(3.2) for actions which fall within the scope of s.3(1). 9) The parties agree that Helen Greyeyes was one of the employees alleged to have abused the plaintiff.  10) The evidence shows that the evidence of the alleged perpetrators is insufficient to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoveryability.","The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA.

c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of the League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, the Executive Committee and the LEADS. The issues raised by this application were: 1) Did the discipline committee err in its finding of fact as set forth in s. 62(3) of the Act or in its application of the burden of proof as alleged in ground number 7 of the notice of appeal? 2) Did it err in applying the onus of proof to the conduct of the appellant when he misrepresented the school improvement process report involving the appellant and of threatening the appellant that if he did not submit his transfer request and resignation from the principalship that the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly' if the appellant did not comply with his terms of the agreement. 3) The discipline committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the School Effectiveness Process report involving said appellant. The Discipline Committee recommended that the appellant be reprimanded (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and fined $2,500. 4) If the facts as found by the disciplinary committee are in fact true, do they constitute unprofessional conduct as set out in the grounds of s. 2 and s. 5 of the Notice of Appeal? 5)Did the discipline Committee err in application of burden of evidence as alleged by ground number 6 of this charge? 6) Was the penalty imposed by the executive committee excessive as an allegation of professional misconduct? 7) In order to establish the allegations by fair and reasonable testimony with the standard of proof being 'the highest possible standard applicable to a civil case' the Committee must first consider the evidence before making its decision.","At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive.

The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief.

Normally the successful party is entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000.

The Plaintiff should have made this motion to determine the order of discovery, without excluding the Defendant's representative as was suggested by the Plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery.

4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012.

On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.

The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The respondents all worked as street level cocaine dealers, selling crack cocaine in gram, gram and gram amounts for a criminal gang based in Edmonton known as the Crazy Dragons. During the last 60 days of their release, the police recorded on wiretaps in excess of 600 drug deals made by the respondents. This would have involved a minimum of 300 grams and a maximum of 2.1 kilograms for proceeds of between $36,000 and $180,000. The respondents worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure that they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. The offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. An appropriate sentence for each respondent, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of these offences, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, for a total of 30 months imprisonment, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. The sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside. HELD: The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, in light of the serious offences, even after considering the mitigating factors of the offenders.  1) The respondents had already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, for which they should be given credit.  2) The sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served.  3) The Court of Appeal was of the view that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to 4 years and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.  4) Considerations of parity alone would have warranted a sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case.  5) The sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offence, particularly in light the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that their motivation was financial gain.  6) The court of appeal allowed the appeal from the bench, substituting a more lengthy period for the conditional sentences originally imposed, with more extensive reasons to follow.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.

Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff sold his farm to his son in 1968 and retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. The trial judge must have been influenced to substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in a manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive.

She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)While aggravated damages may be awarded in actions for breach of contract in appropriate cases, this is not case where they should be given. 2)The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 3)The Court found that the conduct of Healthvision Corp. was high handed and callous. It was not appropriate to award damages based upon the provisions of the employment agreement. 4)The principles of contract law were well established and their broad application would appear preferable to decision-making based on priori and inflexible categories of damages.","She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed.

The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state.

4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle head-on collision. He brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers. The issues of liability and damages were severed following a civil jury trial. The issue of liability only was tried in April 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. With a judicial assessment of damages several months away, the plaintiffs have now brought an application under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A)(1) seeking an interim payment of damages. HELD: The court found that $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiff. Even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by the defendants and the evidence is not complete enough at this stage for the court to be able to form an opinion as to the likelihood of recovery of either of these heads of damages, it is not appropriate to order an interim payments be made for her benefit.  1) The evidence to support the validity of this claim is far from complete at this time and that which is before the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures is yet to be tested. However, the assumptions underlying these claims have not yet even form part of the pleadings. 2) The assumptions underlying the damages claim are not complete. At this stage the court is unable to form a opinion of what damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff at a final assessment of the damages and is not able to formulate an opinion of the likelihood that she will recover some measure of compensation for loss of future earnings.  3) There is no evidence of a pre-existing medical condition which would warrant immediate payment of this amount.  4) The court is not aware that the defendants have yet availed themselves of the opportunity to discover any of Mr. Fowler's medical doctors or to conduct an independent medical examination or to retain other experts as they see fit. 5) Even though the Medical Report also quantifies the loss of valuable services incurred to date (which are nearing the $300,000 mark), there is a much higher degree of certainty that the plaintiff will recover substantial amount of special damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the value of the plaintiff's current earnings. 6) The defendants did not yet have an opportunity to examine any of the plaintiffs' physicians on discovery nor to obtain independent medical examinations or other expert reports.","Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages.

On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed. There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the learned judge in reviewing the conviction misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence alleged and found him guilty as charged.  1)There was nothing to suggest the learned trial judge in weighing the evidence committed any palpable and manifest or overriding error.  2)The appellant was an employee of SaskPower and had access to the storage shed. He was one of six owners of the fishing camp. Two of the other owners were also SaskPower employees. 3)All SaskPower storage sheds at the time could be accessed by single key, so all SaskPower operating employees would have been able to enter the shed at Colonsay. The appellant however was somewhat more closely connected to the owner of the camp. There were various valuable and portable items such as chainsaws in the shed but the only thing missing other than the generator was an electrical cord especially made to use with the generator.  4)The Court reviewed the case of R. v.

No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility.

The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. HELD: Appeal and cross appeals both dismissed. 1) There was ample medical evidence to support that the accident did not contribute, in a material way, to the appellant’s present medical problems. No such reasons were advanced by the appellant in this case.  2) While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to him and at the same time, recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major aggravation of his present problems and his present health problems, the trial Judge assessed the appellant`s general damages at $25.000. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. 3) The appeal was both dismissed and the cross appeal was also dismissed. 4) The appellant is essentially asking this court to set aside the credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the judge and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of appellant's present health issues to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision.

The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT.

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","This is a dispute about the use of property. The plaintiff wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to Borden's property is or incorporates the Bordens driveway. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein.  2) The Defendants have shut off the 'Borden driveway' to the plaintiff and do not consent to his continued use of the garden on their property.  3) There is considerable and convincing evidence that Eldred and Roy Longard in combination used 'the Borden Road' in a continuous, uninterrupted, open, and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. This permission extended by Borden and then to Roy precludes the creation of any right to cross the Bordene driveway created by a prescription or lost modern grant. 4) The nature of the enjoyment necessary to establish a right is not in dispute.","When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription.

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers in a marked construction area, or when passed highway equipment actually on the highway and with its warning lights operating. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The accused is not guilty.  1) The offence is driving at 60 km/hr.  2) The evidence consisted of the following documents: 1) a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken, the speedometer and the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or 3) affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, Mr. Christensen's affidavit and the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search.  4) The accused did not ask for an order requiring the judge to attend for the purpose of cross-examination.","The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff sought a refund of the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax it had paid on well cementing contracts it had with third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s.50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, imposed PST on the contracts. The third parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government at trial. An order was made and the third parties were allowed to do so. The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as claimed in the third party's statement of defence. The court found that the amount to be refunded to the plaintiff was not subject to the limitation period set forth in s.56 of The Education and Health Tax Act. HELD: Even if the Government was entitled to refund of PST from the plaintiff, the payment of the PST from third parties would not be reduced by virtue of the limitation time. 1)The plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the plaintiff and third party contractors. 2)The third party was not liable to pay the PST on any of the contracts it entered into with the plaintiff. 3)The Government was not responsible to refund the PST. 4)The court held that even if the government was liable to refund PST, the parties who entered into the contracts did so in undetermined amounts on materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with Husky. The fact that the plaintiff had not remitted some or all of the PST on the materials and that the parties properly levied and collected tax on the amount of PST allegedly owing was without merit. 5)The Court found that there was no mistake of law in payment of PST by the plaintiff to the Saskatchewan Government. 6)The claim against the plaintiff for refunding the PST was barred by s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act and the Limitation of Actions Act. 7)The amount of the refund was reduced by the limitation of time between the claim and the trial date. 8)The defendant was not entitled to the refund of its PST for the period 1996 to 2001.",The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.

P. Weber was tendered in evidence establishing that a true copy of the certificate had been served upon the accused.

Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely the prize in procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. The validity of the stop is one of fact and the stop was not a fact. 2)The appellant was asked notwithstanding the above finding of error of law to consider whether, in the circumstances the police officer was justified in stopping the respondent's vehicle.

B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The order of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 1)Human rights are more than just statutory rights. They are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. While it is true that the employees' employment rights were inferentially affected because the alleged act of discrimination was addressed by the collective agreement, the mere fact that an alleged violation of the Code occurred in place of employment rather than in some other setting is not determinative. 2)The Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship of the employees. The Act provides that all disputes between the parties to collective agreement concerning employment rights covered in the agreement must be resolved by binding arbitration. 3)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights it seeks to protect. 4)The fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on a basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach. 5)A board of inquiry appointed pursuant to s. 25 of the Human Rights Code would have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the matter. 6)The Board of inquiry was appointed by the Minister of Justice pursuant to Rules 664 and 663 of the Queen’s Bench Rules of Court with the result that the appellant was entitled to costs on double column in this Court and on the appropriate tariff in the court below.","Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount.

Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion.

The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine.

5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.

b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The principle question is whether this 1950 Freeholders agreement is void under the common law rule. It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 2) The Court reviewed the history of the Freeholders lease and found that it was in the public domain and could be the subject of a breach of a perpetuity rule. There were hundreds of such leases in this province. The trial judge found that the phrase 'upon' and 'in the event', connote time and condition and not property or an interest in property. 3) There was no law of remoteness in the original lease. To ascribe to those words definition equivalent to way of describing reversionary interest is to distort the words beyond recognition. 4) In some jurisdictions the concept of 'top leases' is not unique or unusual in the Oil and Gas industry. The law of perpetuity plays no role in that process. It would not be contrary to the public interest to remove such leases from the ambit of the Rule against perpetuity. 5) In this case the Court found for the appellant that the 'top leasing' programme of Freeholders and Imperial Oil Ltd. did not infringe on the 'rules of construction'. Rather, it was a matter for the Court to determine whether the lease breached the rules of construction. 6) The court found that there was no evidence that the term 'offence' in the lease could be used to refer to the term of the lease. 7) In the context of the present situation, it is clear and unambiguous that the test for whether there has been a breach is not seriously disputed by the parties.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease.

If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, coke ovens and steel plant. The defendants sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1), naming of two classes of persons who owned property within stated radius (Property Owner Class) and (2) persons who resided within that radius for minimum period after January 5, 1968 (Residential Class). The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification order was issued, and the court dismissed the motion seeking earlier filing. The motion was dismissed with costs of $1,000 in the cause of the appeal. HELD: This appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the defendant. Rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. If the certification is struck, the defendant will still face individual claims, first filed in 2004, involving similar issues. The expense of defending individual claims whether litigated serially or jointly, might exceed the expense defending one common issue trial. One purpose of class proceeding is to try common issues once, instead of repeatedly, which delivers an expense efficiency to both sides. In this case, that efficiency may be sacrificed.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet of St. George's Hill to install sewer and water lines on four lots. He arranged to do this by using an individual he knew as a 'employer' to do the backhoe work on the excavation. As a matter of fact no inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specificguidance and supervision. HELD: The defendant was guilty as charged on all offences. 1)The defendant had no obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers at the excavation site. He chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters which had taken him to Laloche and then to Saskatoon when the trenching was being done at StGeorge's Hill. 2)The evidence was clear that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of master and servant or employer and employee. The fact that the defendant arranged for his nephew to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the relationship was akin to that of a'self-employed person' acting as a sub-contractor which have specifically adjudged that he was not in the circumstances of this case.  3)The court found that once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, then his obligations under the law are to take active steps to ensure that all work at the place of employment was sufficiently and competently supervised, and did not fail to provide and maintain for work site readily accessible first aid station containing required supplies and equipment, contrary to S. 57(b). 4)The principles of the case were not in dispute and they were fairly straight-forward. The evidence was not inconsistent with the defendant's failure to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the two workers.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations.

The Respondent argued that the respondent was negligent in the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home to the respondent's estranged spouse. HELD: 1) The respondent firmly believed that this was an obvious overbilling. The respondent was unrepentant and did not keep her informed of all actions taken on her behalf and acted without instructions. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the respondent, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, but, as required, went on to assess the reasonableness of Mr. Miller's legal accounts and some reductions were made. 3) There is very little in the Small Claims Court Act, supra, which specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court. There is a strong presumption in favour of judicial impartiality and the presumption is that such an oath as that made by an Adjudicator at the outset of his or her appointment will be respected by that adjudicator. However, in some judicial districts in Nova Scotia, there may only be a roster of one or two Adjudicators who hear a small Claims Court case. In this case, Ms. Stephen firmly believes that this is an obvious underbilling and the respondent is negligent in this regard. 4) In both civil law and criminal law contexts, courts have repeatedly found that decision-makers' participation in earlier proceedings involving the same party or parties who are again before the decision-maker in fresh, new proceedings does not, and should not, invariably lead to disqualification. Such prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension.","The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter.

The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT.

Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

As well, the admission of the evidence would well render a remedy under s. 24(2) of The Charter. In this case, the accused is not guilty. 3) The Certificate of Analyses was not necessary to prove the offence under s253(a). The Court also concluded that there was no evidence of slurred speech. 4) The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights, activated the emergency lights on his vehicle, and went to check on the driver, with concern that he might be in some nature of physical distress. He identified the accused seated upright behind the wheel, wearing a bathing suit. He appeared to be sound asleep, or passed out. He was aware of the smell and alcohol coming from the accused. He grabbed him by the wrist, and the co-accused woke up immediately. Shortly thereafter, he was able to comprehend what was happening.

b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice.

The appellant appealed the conviction appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The verdict in this case came down to a question of credibility. The trial judge failed to adhere to and properly apply the principles and purposes of sentencing pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, [YCJA], as the guiding legal principle in such circumstances. 2) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant.

The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew.

However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice.

The result favoured joining the federation. 2) In the interim, the respondent applied under s. 135(2)(b) of the Act to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by a non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. The applicant applied under the non-profit corporation provisions of the 1995 Act.

No. 45 (QL), where Justice McLachlin (as she then was) summarized the relevant legal principles with respect to the setting aside of the results of an election. 6) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary.

HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year.

There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment.

The chambers judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the child would have on the appellant's relationship with her father against the loss of possible contact, support and inheritance. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as result of the interplay between s. 67(1)(f) of the Act and the extended families of either parent. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The facts are scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the Chambers judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. 2) Without the adoption the child will continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with the appellant whether the adoption is granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship.  3) The appellant did not satisfy on the meagre facts available to him that he failed to take into account the applicable enumerated factors set out in s3(2)(n) in determining whether the proposed adoption was in the best interests of the child.  4) The Chamber judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child’s best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. 5) There was no evidence as to why there had been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between them and their extended families. We do not know how the child was supported from November 2000 when the father ceased support until February 2003 when the appellant started her present job.","The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","This issue largely involved Part III of The Consumer Protection Act and inter alia, the question of whether or not a consignee is a'retail seller' as defined in that Part. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The plaintiff did not reject the goods within a reasonable period. He was entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and properly recoverable.  2)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered. The remuneration to Triple was to be 10% of the selling price. 3)In the circumstances, the plaintiff was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly that Triple R is deemed to have given to the plaintiff the warranties set out in the Act. 4)The court found support for the notion that persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in the Latin phrase Expressio Unius. It means that when certain persons or things are specified in law an intention to exclude all others from its operation may be inferred.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b).

The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129.

The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2) of the Business Corporations Act.  1) There is no dispute that the defendants, and particularly Peak Enterprises Inc., have failed to present reasonable grounds for believing that the corporation is or would be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or otherwise. The defendants have not provided any professional analysis or affidavit evidence in support of their proposition that s34 is applicable. 2) The affidavit of Donald Beveridge, sworn on July 15, 2005, did not require Peak to make any payments to purchase or redeem the shares issued by it. The cross-examination of the defendant on his affidavit disclosed that Peak is a profitable company and that the realizable value of Peak's assets would be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and the amount that would be required to be paid to other shareholders who have right to be compensated on redemption or in liquidation, rateably with or prior to the holders of the shares to be purchased or redeemed. 3) Peak does not have possession of any share certificates in Ascent and the Court may direct judgment under subrule (1) to be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution.

It is this amount which she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment application. 5) The Court is of the view that s.34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The Act does not prevent the defendant from making a payment to redeem shares, in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever it is necessary to be a shareholder of Peak in conjunction with its claim for the unpaid Dividends against Peak.

The company had performed well in the Atlantic Provinces but had suffered from severe cash flow problems.

This, being the test, was not the correct test. 2)The Court was not satisfied that the trial judge's assessment of the loss was correct. The Court was unable to determine the exact extent of the respondent's loss as a result of the misrepresentations made by the financial statements. 3)It was impossible to perform that reconstruction.

It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic. HELD: 1) There is no evidence that a solicitor-client relationship exists between the law firm and the plaintiffs. The law firm has failed to rebut the presumption that confidential information was imparted to the lawyers in that law firm. There is a risk the confidential information will be used to prejudice that client. 2) It is not the job of this Court to pass upon lawyer's adherence to the Code, nor to punish or discipline lawyers. It must be recalled that the duty to avoid conflicts is simply an adjunct to a lawyer's underlying duty to refrain from using confidential information received from former clients. In practice, Rule 2.04(10) operates to prevent situations from arising which carry a heightened risk of breach of confidentiality. 3) The law is clear that it is to be viewed from the vantage point of the client not the lawyer. The former client need only satisfy the court of its broad relevance to the proceedings at hand and of the risk posed if it passed into the hands of the other party. The Court should not require client to disclose what information or types of information it seeks to protect or to explain how such information may be relevant to proceedings. 4) The Court must consider the matter with an eye to and concern for the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety.",HELD: The Court granted the application.

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","This motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.

The purpose of the order now made is to place him on notice that the will of the shareholders and the contracts under which the company was formed are not to be brushed aside. 2)The shareholders' agreement was amended by de-deleting paragraph 3. Board of Directors and substituting the words 'therefor'. This was an unusual restriction. The board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though Bondco and eventually the Government of Saskatchewan are entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the board, they cannot change the board and if they try to dictate policy they do not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. 3)The Court was directed to make an order to rectify the matters complained of.","The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide breath samples contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges.  1)The accused had been a member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years.

As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street against a red light he observed a motorcyclist operating a moped. The moped had an electric motor under the seat. The accused indicated that he was pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike. The officer testified that he observed the accused stumble and sway from side to side while driving the moped and that the accused appeared to be dragging his feet while driving. 2)The Crown failed to prove the accused's motor vehicle was motor vehicle. The Crown must prove that Mr. Rookes' GiO bike was an electric bicycle. The court found the accused guilty of operating the motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug. 3)The court found that the offence was not under s.253(1(a) and s.254(5) as the accused had failed to provide samples of his breath for analysis. 4)The Court found that there were no errors in the test results. The test results did not support the Crown's argument that the motor was not operating at the time of the offence. 5)There was no evidence that the electric vehicle was operational that evening.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body.

The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. HELD: The appeal concerns whether that suspicion, based on the facts as found by the trial judge, satisfies the objective requirement of s. 254(2)(b). There is no basis for disturbing this finding of fact.  1) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Duguay, [1996] SCC 35 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527. 2) The court found that, in determining there were not reasonable grounds for a reasonable grounds to suspect that a person has alcohol in their body and that the ASD demand was not based on reasonable suspicion, it is violation of the accused's rights under ss. and of the Charter. The Court found that Cst. Kowalenko, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand that the complainant provide incriminating evidence against himself'. There is a finding of facts. There is an absence of factors that actually led the officer to his belief. The nervousness and lack of desire to explain what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning are not factors that will be taken into account in determining the reasonability of the suspicion. The time of the incident is only relevant to the extent it provides context to the other factors.  2) Where a reasonable person, placed in the shoes of a police officer, would not conclude on these facts that a suspicion is not reasonable, there was a violation of Mr. Plantje's s. and s. Charter rights under s. 24(2). The Court concluded that the Court's finding that the suspicion was not reasonable and that there was no other reason for detaining the accused, there is a reasonable requirement that the officer satisfy s.254(2(b).

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The plaintiff was a student at a school operated by the defendant school board and the co-defendant was the teacher within the meaning of the provisions of the Education Act. At all material times the automobile was not stolen or otherwise wrongfully taken out of the possession of the defendant and the owner of the motor vehicle was liable for the plaintiff's injuries. In the event Edith Larsen is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Highway Traffic Act, the school board is liable to the plaintiff for bodily injury, loss and damage caused by the negligence of the negligent driver. HELD: The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. The immunity only applies to schoolteachers and principals. 1)In this case the plaintiff was immune. There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provides that negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of s.228 of The Act. Even if there were an apparent conflict with the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the Highway Traffic act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of the same s. 86(1) of the Act. 2)In the event the teacher was not liable, the board is immune.",FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment contained the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provided for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in 2002 for an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that his income was significantly higher than $110,000. On the same basis she also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) Given the various sources of income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is reasonable to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of child support payable in the subsequent year. It is reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.  2) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952.25 the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. Given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of the respondent's income such that she has not had the resources to provide lifestyle similar to the one they enjoyed prior to their parent's separation. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents' support. 3) The Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on income in excess of $150,000 without interruption to June 30, 2003. Given Ashley's limited ability to earn income during her short hiatus from school and considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parents to contribute to her support it is appropriate that support be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999.

The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal as per oral reasons. HELD: An appeal from the hearing officer to the tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review. It has no place within this statutory appeals process. There is no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than it does. The Tribunal must, in such cases, afford the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. Support for this approach can be found in the very wide scope of the appeal and the appeal is allowed. The matter is remitted. 1)The basis for dismissing the appellant's appeal was the Tribunal's conclusion that the Hearing Officer did not arrive at a decision which was patently unreasonably unreasonable. It employed the language of the tribunal employed in expressing this conclusion. 2)Do not find it patently reasonable that a hearing officer found that the inference the Worker was seeking was not reasonable one. The inference being sought by the worker is that his knee problem arose out of and in the course of his employment. The medical evidence did not support the inference that the worker was seeking. Do not have to find that would reach the same conclusion that she reached.","The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal.

2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children.

Rhetorically, it must be asked if she can withstand the daily pressure of raising two active boys, especially when this is coupled with the ongoing strain of poor relations with the father. 2) There are other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here. 3) The parents' past habit of consuming alcohol while taking prescribed medication has compromised their emotional bond with the children.

This is a rich and complicated background against which they must be interpreted. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The appellants relied on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The deceased's dependants had no separate claim for the loss of support suffered directly by them as result of the wrongful act because no cause of action for wrongful death was recognized. Their only option was to sue for damages for loss of expectation of life. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1) There was no trial in this matter. The facts before the Court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving a preliminary point of law. The law limits the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) There is a common law rule in Nova Scotia that all causes of action subsisting against or vested in a person, except for defamation, survived and could be asserted after death by the deceased's personal representatives. 3) In Nova Scotia, the Court found that the estate was not entitled to do so because loss of its future earning capacity does not constitute an 'actual pecuniaiary loss' as required by the Survival of Actions Act. There was a limitation on damages set out in s. 1(1) of the 1954 Act that permitted this claim to be asserted by the personal representatives of the deceased. It also allowed recovery of damages for the guidance, care and companionship which the deceased would have received had he lived and continued to provide support.  4) The Court reviewed the various provincial and territorial enactments and, among other things, the House of Lords decision in Rose v. Ford and the Ontario amendments of 1938 in response to it. The Court of Appeal agreed that no such damages could be awarded in this case. 5) Nova Scotia legislation does not do away entirely with common law.

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here.

Pursuant to that statute, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the respondent's habitual residence and if the appellant was wrongfully retaining the child, the appellant would be required to pay child support.

If the order under appeal is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10, that order would have to be registered with Nova Scotia to be enforced.  2) Since Nova Scotia is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.N.S., c. 67 which implements the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction would be applicable. 3) The respondent is essentially asking for an interim order temporarily allowing the appeal.

Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20."

2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The Mayflower Mall was constructed in 1979. The owners concerned with safety issues arising from the report recommended that open web steel joists be inspected by qualified professional engineers. The owner of the mall claimed against United Dominion Industries Corporation, of which Robb Engineering was a division, for the cost of the inspection and remediation of the Mall. HELD: 1) The actual repairs were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not necessary to repair defects to the joist and mitigate the danger. 2) The owners followed the recommendations of the report, followed the consultants' recommendation and undertook remediation. 3) The amount of work in the plant determined how much time and effort it would take to complete the inspection. 4) The quality of the welds was poor with weld failures and poor fit up noted throughout. 5) There was a marked increase in failures above length category 4. 6. The average for buildings inspected in Nova Scotia containing Robb joists was 2.28%. In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty years and had a strict quality control program, such as the one implemented by the Department of Transportation and Public Works for the Government's own buildings, this clearly cannot be performed successfully on welds which are masked by slag deposits. 6) There were issues regarding the control of the quality of welding during the fabrication of joists. The issue was whether there was a real and substantial danger to the occupants of the building. The report set out a proposed remediation scheme, which was based on a recommendation by the Nova Scotia Department of transportation and Public works for the government's own building. 7) The respondents followed the report. The respondents were concerned about safety issues. The Nova Scotia report recommended all joists fabricated by Robb Engineering be inspected to allow for routine inspection for weld quality and weld length. Although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the 'open web steel' joists were necessary and were subsequently inspected by MPI until we have the assurance that the defects are addressed, additional remediation may be advisable around the or 10 length and above.

He said his wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to the bank shares and he therefore, did not have full understanding of how they were dealt with. 3) On the equally important second test, the applicant is satisfied that his wife's interests are at risk because he has passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship, to John Conrod, a third party.  4) The applicants are entitled to show cause why the Royal Bank shares held in her and her husband's names as joint tenants should not be treated as assets and included in the estate or, in the alternative, subject to certain trusts.  5) The Court is not deciding that issue today.","Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate."

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services, a newly formed division of Ritchie Bros. The plaintiff was purportedly retiring from farming and the transaction was in the closing stages at the time the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In this transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on his behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder, and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of a clean auction. There are no owner buybacks, no artificial or manipulated values, no reserves, and no minimums, and in case where an owner is caught in direct attempt to buy back his property or move to a new location, the breach is obvious and the response is swift. An announcement is made to the crowd that the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, in that Ritchie's had included the full sale price of the combine when it calculated the gross proceeds of sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. The taking amounted to trespass and conversion. 3) In the first flush of togetherness, the defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc. (Hodgins). The defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction (C&A). The formal transaction was not effectively concluded until January 2004. It was apparently a share acquisition, such that the defendant could not possibly match the plaintiff's purchase price. 4) The plaintiff, who had rented out the majority of his lands the year prior, had arranged for Hodgins to come and inspect his equipment","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit.

7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure.

4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused left the area, went to the rear of the building and in close quarters, as the accused himself testified, threw a kitchen knife at the complainant. The complainant was injured in the confrontation and the accused ran towards his vehicle, where the complainant confronted him and slashed his tire on the complainant's car. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the complainant and the words used by the accused were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. 2) The Crown had established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 was clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code.  3) The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him by the defendant. The evidence showed that the complainant initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the accused, who was in his personal space. While the accused's reaction and his statement was regrettably crude, disrespectful and insensitive to the complainant, nevertheless the fact that he did not further assail the complainant nor touch him could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the accused considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against the defendant, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s.267(a).","The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code.

Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch.

The Adjudicator did not find that the Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The presence of a special relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim.

There was a nexus between the defendant's and the plaintiff's labour force. 3)In almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, there was no unjust enrichment because there did not exist special relationship.

8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his sisters.

The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice.

However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until some 36 minutes later. The delay was not satisfactory and the delay may have prejudiced the accused. HELD: The breath tests were to be taken as soon as practicable. 1) The reasonable suspicion standard is very low and having regard to the evidence, and the existing law, that threshold has been met. The difficulty in the instant case is that, as the Crown has pointed out, defence did not mention the s. 8 violation in its Charter notice. As such, defence should not be allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial.  2) The need to take the tests as quickly as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit.  3) The accused had to be booked, she wished to use the washroom, she spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel, and it was necessary to comply with the breathalyzer room.  4) There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, the time from arrival at the scene to the taking of the second sample, 77 minutes.  5) The delay in departing the scene is not satisfactory. The delays, if any, are satisfactorily explained. 2) There was no compelling reason, or need, to wait for the tow truck or trucks to arrive. The Court of Queen's Bench in Beaton relied on the Court of Appeal's decision in Carter (para 9).

In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there.

Therefore, the boys are to reside in the petitioner's home or Air Ronge, Saskatchewan and attend school there while residing with the petitioner.

9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought a judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the respondent had acquired the house prior to the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the wife was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or the loans. With that, the appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in concluding that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because he had acquired it prior to commencing the relationship between the parties. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution.  2)The Court considered the equivalent of this section in Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 1992 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), and Vilcu v. Grams (1999), 172 Sask.R. 201(Sask.C.A.). The Court considered that Mitchell was an equivalent to this section. It was not the same in that Mitchell had been statute barred. The Court held that it was far from clear the respondent will ever be required to repay them. 3)The respondent's position regarding the loans he obtained from his parents to enable him purchase the Vancouver property and the mortgages in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions of s.21 and 23 of the Act.  4)The evidence showed that the trial judge did not err in finding that the parties had become'spouses within the meaning of the act in late June 1994 and then in holding that Ms. Ruskin was entitled in equal proportion to its value without any reduction to the gifts or loans. 5)The court considered that the issue of distribution in whole or in part was governed by s.22 rather than s. 21 and 23. The matter was governed not by the Act but by section 23.","This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. She sought judgment distributing their property.

1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. The decision did not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. Where the parties have negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled on the breakdown of their marriage, and the agreement is not unconscionable in the substantive law sense, it should be respected. The basic principle in Pelech is that. settlement agreements must be respected and there is an element of unforeseeability by the parties as of the time the consensual arrangement is arrived at.

The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal) was reviewed and reinstated on an interim basis. There were numerous errors made by the Tribunal. The Tribunal did err in some respects and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant. The appellant brought this appeal by way of written notice of appeal dated January 21, 2016.

The holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any members of the patient care team.

2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The issue was the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay one-half of the $4,237.16 he claimed for child support, past and future.  2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he expressed a contrary position.  3) The Court reviewed the circumstances and found that the fees were ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. It was appropriate that his income be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005, which was $41,834.50. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) There was a material change in the petitioner's income over the years. She claimed for full day's wages. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for half the time in any event. Her actual loss would be less. An appropriate retroactive variation should be effected.  6) The court reviewed the respondent’s personal and professional expenses and concluded that it would be fair if the contributions were equal, taking into account that the incomes were comparable.","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future.

The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event."

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1) There was no evidence at the amplification hearing to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered.  2) The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone.  3) The application was to allow the Crown to supplement the record with testimony of that which was in the minds of the police and assist in proving the elements of the offence.,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography.

As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3.

The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused owned a dog, to wit, that without provocation attacks a person. The accused displayed a sign on the fence warning of the presence of the dog with the wording 'Guard Dog on Duty, Beware of Dog'. The court found that the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady attending a garage sale. The court imposed a fine of $200. HELD: The accused did not take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. There were seven specific pieces of evidence that supported the Crown's conclusion. 1)There was clear evidence that on the occasion when Mrs. Barks was in her back alley, the dog escaped through the garbage can enclosure. 2)The evidence was not discredited on cross-examination as to what she observed or what she felt. 3)The court found there was no reasonable step taken to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. 4)The accused had not taken reasonable steps. There was no evidence that he went through the house where the dog ran. 5)The Court was of the view that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence has been committed, and if the Crown proves on that basis that it has, then it's open to the accused to establish on balance of probabilities that he took such reasonable steps as were necessary to prevent an attack. The appropriate fine in the circumstances is $200 for the offence.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty.

As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid.

The singular ground of appeal cited in the respondent's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The respondent mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. He was mistaken as to what would be the outcome of his absence. His conscience choice to ignore the hearing notification resulted in the judgment against him. Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claims Court and the Court did what it was authorized to do by statute and Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the Respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did not attend the hearing. This is not a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra nor one that the Court had sympathy for. The Appellant was not mistaken about the date of the hearing nor was he mistaken as what would happen in the absence of his wife. The hearing was held on the 20th day of April 2010. The adjudicator was satisfied that the requirements for substituted service had been met and the matter proceeded. The Respondent proved her claim and made that finding as well. The appellant did not ignore the notice of the Hearing. He chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries.

e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of four counts of sexual assault. The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The court also held that there were other mitigating factors to consider, such as whether the accused intended the victim receive a communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, or by present state of mind that an accused knew the substantial and unjustified risk that the victim would receive.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15.

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse.

However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff loaned some $69,000 to the defendant on or about the 30th day of January 2001. The claim goes on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1)The only evidence that might suggest that a transaction was made by the defendant Kelly Eiswerth was that some of the payments made by her to the plaintiff were in excess of $ 1,500, the plaintiff felt she received a profit from the first transaction and chose to pay for another vehicle instead of deducting that amount from what was owed. There is also evidence that the plaintiff benefitted the husband by repurchasing equipment that the husband had lost to the trustee in bankruptcy and gifting it back to the husband.

The Jamaican entered Canada in May 2003 and is entitled to remain in Canada as permanent resident for the time being. He has a permanent resident card which expires May 5, 2008. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)It is alleged that the Attorney General has not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. Counsel for the Minister of Justice however has undertaken that everything within the control of the AG General has been turned over to the solicitor for Griffiths except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. He is not entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. 2)The motion on Griffiths's behalf is without merit and it is dismissed. The motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing was without merit. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. 3)The role of the hearing judge is modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case that the act alleged would constitute a crime in Canada. It is not the business of the extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition proceeding. This would seem to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. 4)It follows that the extent of Griffiths' right to disclosure of documents and information is limited to those issues specific to the functions of this Court. The application on his behalf is to stay proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: contempt of court by the AG for failing to provide proper disclosure; alternatively, the production by the Attorney general of witness statements and other evidence in compliance with the common law duty of procedural fairness as it applies in administrative proceedings; in the alternative, production of witness statement and other information pursuant to s. of the Charter.",The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine.

They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and concluded that his risk to re-offend violently in the future was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: 1) The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction. 2) It is an absolute necessity that the offender seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. If he refuses to do so, his risk for committing acts of future violence is high. He appears to predate upon intimate partners for reasons which are not clear to me. However, there seems to be a pattern of offending in this way, which needs serious attention. This risk will largely be mitigated by conscientious application of his knowledge of the ways in which to vent his anger.","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code.

HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The plaintiff was granted a mortgage for $3,100,000 repayable by two installments of $300, then the balance payable on April 30, 2009. The defendant issued a statement of claim in October 2009 seeking foreclosure on the Land. None of the defendants entered defence but served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. By its notice of motion, the plaintiff seeks an order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The court reviewed Christie v. Texas Industries (1985), 1985 CanLII 2631 and found that the Christie case remains the controlling authority, such that when applied to this case rejection of the submissions on the applicability and effect of ss. and 11 must follow. The Christie case had no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, and neither at that time nor since has there been any other similar legislation to the SFSA, nor was it intended that a developer, by leasing a parcel of land in the circumstances of this case, could gain the protection of the Farm Land Security Act; the defendant's focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land was the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park.","The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born in Canada. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Canada and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The children have been returned. 1) The Court is faced with the fact that change in primary caregiving might occur as result of a 'chasing order' issued in the former jurisdiction. Psychological harm to children may result by reason of the severance of that primary caregiver relationship. 2) More than a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of judicial proceedings and it can be demonstrated that the child is now settled into his new environment. 3) The respondent has demonstrated he has right to custody and therefore meets the obligation under Article 12 of the Convention. Once it has been determined that child has been wrongfully removed or retained the Hague Convention mandates the court to order the child's return forthwith. There is no suggestion that the exceptions under the Convention under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable.","The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut.

Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights.

The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The Court could not find on the evidence clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by her daughter clearly indicated request for final billing. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, thereby making any adjustment in the price of the property difficult to assess.  2)The court cannot find that clear instructions were provided by the defendant to the Town to disconnect water service were clearly indicated.

B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation."

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff's holiday pay should be based on his wage, plus one-half of his truck expense allowance. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to the claim for holiday pay. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his holiday pay for 10 years and the defendant asserts that it would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right.  1) The plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He further claimed that the holiday pay owing should be calculated on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance. 2) The defendant claimed that if the court found that the defendant's all-inclusive contract was not all inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the time the plaintiff spent away from work must be considered holidays.  3) The court reviewed the various pleadings and the issues on which to base any holiday pay entitlement is his monthly wage and benefits, based on the 40 hour work week, as he was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act and therefore not entitled to overtime. 4) The Court reviewed the numerous other pleadings that were made in relation to the same subject matter. 5) In the meantime, the plaintiff may rely on s. 33 to establish that the allowance was really wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax in the event that the court determined this Court had jurisdiction to determine the entitlement to holidays. The Defendant asserts that the plaintiffs hours of work were very flexible in the winter. It was only in the first winter of his employment that he was required to be at work 30 hours per week. He did not put in the time for sick days, including time off for leg operation, but he was never required to keep track of those days off.

They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid.

The accused were found guilty of publishing a matter without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to insult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false and did thereby commit an offence contrary to s.300 of the Code.

The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments to January in each year. The employer sought to strike the respondent's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge erred in allowing the court's action to continue. The Chambers judge's reasoning was that, where there is doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration. This view is mandated by the text of the collective agreement and the Trade Union Act. The central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations is the forum for conducting the necessary inquiry and helps ensure no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator.
