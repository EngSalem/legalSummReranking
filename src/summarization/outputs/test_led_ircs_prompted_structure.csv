b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.",The parties agreed to share joint custody of the three children of a numbered company solely owned by the father. The father was to have exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and primary care was to be with the mother. The mother opposed the payment of spousal support in any form. She argued that the father had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and that the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. HELD: 1) The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order shall issue and that primary care shall remain with the wife. 2) The father is to have periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology. 3) The children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. There is no evidence that the parents pose a flight risk to the children. 4) The mother is to give notice of the activity and the cost of the tuition. 5) The parents are to cooperate in obtaining passports. 6) Section 7(2) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines establish a basis upon which to impute this income to the applicant.
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There is no retroactivity problem. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone. 2)The terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. Both statutes contemplate an application to the Court for forfeiture of such property. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof.  3)The legislation is civil not criminal in nature, and it is an in rem remedy. The date of charges is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which accumulated under the 1996 order. HELD: 1) The father's decision to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The mother may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive pursuant to my order will be payable on a net of tax basis.  2) On all of the evidence, the father is underemployed. His choice to work only 3 months of the year and/or return to the school is not a reasonable decision when he has a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie.  3) The mother's position has not changed as a result of the order for child support. The court has grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding, which delays were primarily the result of Mr. Pilat's unwillingness to provide adequate financial disclosure."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act[1] for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision by the Rentalsman. HELD: 1)Application allowed. Did the Chambers judge err in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid? 2)The Court of Appeal has leave to make an order placing the Landlord in possession of the rental premises.  3)The tenants have until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their notice of appeal and 15 days thereafter to file their appeal book and factum. 4)The Chambers judge dismissed the tenants' appeal the same day."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. HELD: The accused was charged with two counts of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the CDSA and one count of possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. There had been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached on the charges. No explanation was offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The respondent applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The respondent did not suggest any change in his hours of work or work schedule. What has changed is that his mother is no longer available to provide child care during the day on the Saturday of his access weekends. These orders have been made in order to provide some predictability for the children. It does not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion, but says that there is no evidence that any other cattle were there. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted in favour of the plaintiffs, together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present s.27 (1) and the pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle."
b_1995canlii5775.txt,"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors. HELD: 1)An application was opposed by one of the creditors, namely, Oak Bluff Estates Ltd. (Oak Bluff).  2)The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of secured creditors of the corporation and not the general body of creditors. 3)The terms of the proposal were reasonable and were calculated in good faith. The proposal did not comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy and was not properly approved by the creditors in accordance with s. 54(2)(d) and s. 59(2(d). 4)The trustee described GM and GMAC as 'franchise creditors' in his report to the unsecured creditors. This is an unfortunate description as the Act contemplates only three categories of creditors preferred, secured and unrated. Nevertheless, am not prepared to withhold approval to the proposal on this basis."
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988 and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage. They agreed to keep their assets separate and to not make claim on the assets of the other. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to their respective children. HELD: 1)The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage. There was no conflict in the evidence of the parties as to the verbal agreement they made at the marriage and maintenance thereof was born solely by the petitioner during the years of marriage.  2)There was no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s.22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. 3)The parties were married for 40 years. The respondent purchased furniture for the condominium, a 1993 Buick and camper for a total agreed upon value of $42,000.  4)The respondent purchased a camper and a truck for $54,000 which was being held in trust pending the outcome of this proceeding. 5)The wife's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. Although it may be argued that the Melville home was at one time the 'family home' of the two parties, designate the Regina condominium to be the 'Family Home' pursuant to s. 22(3) as the Act as the parties resided therein for most of their marriage.

c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal was from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Board and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s.5.3 or from the context of the entire statute, or from a purposive approach, the result is the same.

e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention was that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed without order as to costs. 1)There was no negligence on the part of the Town in determining the plaintiff's liability. 2)The Court could not find on the evidence clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the defendant clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, thereby making any adjustment to the price of the property. 3)The plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: the Court could find no evidence the defendant's action was unable to succeed because the Court cannot find that clear instructions were provided to the plaintiff by the Town to disconnect water service; there was a likelihood that the pipes would burst in winter due to the possibility of damage occurring. The Court would not have been able to assess the damage to the premises without the daughter's involvement. 4)No amount of money was being paid out of pocket."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home.

The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was hired to assist the plaintiff with the purchase of the home. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of the realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. HELD: 1) The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of $400,000.00.  2) The property was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was the defendant Mario Jacobucci, the owner of the last defendant, Trevi Holdings Ltd. 3) The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She was concerned that the property was too expensive for her to afford. There was no discussion about extending the deadline to remove the conditions so that further investigations into the condition of the house could be carried out. The search for a suitable home expanded to acreages in the neighbouring environs.  4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to damages against the defendants based upon mental and emotional distress, aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress.  5) The defendant was liable to the plaintiff in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  6) The Court found the plaintiff to be entitled to special and general damages, including damages based on mental, emotional distress and aggravated damages, as well as punitive damages, against the defendant and the plaintiff for breach of the terms of the contract."
7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties applied to vary spousal and/or child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The parties originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. Macdonald's improved employment and income situation. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for support purposes was $41,000 and he was to pay child support of $567.00 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. 2) There was a current need for a lump sum award to compensate the respondent for her relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above. The respondent was ordered to pay $8,000 in child support. 3) Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the respondent should be credited the amount of that lump sum. There should be stability of payments for the recipient and the payor."

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, a judgment left the issue of division of property until a later date for reasons outlined at that time. The petitioner did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required surgery on his back making it impossible for him to physically do the work. As a result, a hearing date was set for May 13 at which the respondent was asked in accordance with my prior judgment to complete the division. The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the spousa maintenance order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)Division of property based on asset values which are at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. The respondent was granted 56% of the estimated asset value and 44% of his wife's 44% share of the value of a 1990 Oldsmobile which fix for this purpose at $9,000 in order to achieve a 50% split of the assets to each party.  2)The respondent did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. He claims this was in violation of the original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. However, counsel for the respondent suggests that include all of the property in my order dividing the assets because he intends to take the position that the respondent's share of those assets may be subject to constructive trust and should he succeed in that contention then the trustee in bankruptcy would not be able to claim her share of that assets for distribution to the unsecured creditors of the petitioner under his bankruptcy. 3)Divisions of property divided based on the values indicated by the evidence including, on the foregoing analysis 56% to the respondent and 44 percent to the wife. Each side shall bear their own costs."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin.

Revenue Canada objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt on the basis that Section 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act prohibited the use of tax information. The bankrupt argued that the Act was intended to protect his common law spouse, Patti Ann McCool, and the company that she was sole director and a shareholder of. HELD: 1)The court found that the application for discharge was being opposed by certain creditors. 2)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. 3)There was an investigation conducted by the R.C.M.P. as a result of the superintendent's investigation order. The evidence would not support a successful prosecution. 4)Reasons for the denial of the application were not satisfied. 5)The applicant was not satisfied that the principles and exemption contained in the Excise Tax Act would allow disclosure of certain paragraphs of the applicant's affidavit.

(2010) to summarize the principles and case law relevant to determining a cost award under Rule 77.

HELD: The applicant/plaintiff was to be paid all monies paid into court by SPMC with respect to the two files together with accrued interest less the amount previously paid out. The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v. Prudential Assurance Co create a fund from which creditors must be paid, the claim by the Minister of Labour as of the date of the application was not a proven claim. No certificate had been issued and no judgment had been entered as of that date. A judgment had been filed by the plaintiff. He was the only party entitled to the monies.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, 626170 Saskatchewan Ltd., for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 9, 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC"") the proposed garnishhee. On April 29 1999, the SPMC filed notice with the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench of potential wage claims owing by the defendant company to its employees pursuant to s. 54 of The Labour Standards Act. Tapp then made an ex parte application for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPMC. The court granted the application by Tapp by notice of motion and the matter was heard in Chambers. No one appeared on behalf of the other parties. At the time of the application for the payment out the Minister of Labour had not obtained judgment against either defendant and there was no evidence that he had filed a claim against either company.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC) by Leo Larsen, its former president and chief executive officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum."

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not succeed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or none assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There were appropriate circumstances to allow the plaintiff to post a security for the costs at this stage as it wished to provide an opportunity at the pre-trial conference stage for the matter to be resolved. 2)The plaintiff was advised of the plaintiffs' position.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order requiring Red Seal to serve pre-certification notices to all persons who travelled with the plaintiff during the purposed class. The motion was dismissed. HELD: 1) The application for examination was dismissed on the basis that the plaintiff could not rely on s. 14 prior to certification of the action as a class action. 2) It is important to remember that we are in the pre certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. This is a still an action and not one of the class actions. An action is defined under s. 7 of The Queen's Bench Act as meaning 'an action certified as class action pursuant to Part II' and a Class Action is defined as an action certified under Part III of the Act. 3) The court reviewed the words of s.14 and s. 24 of our Act and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit. It was clear that Red Seal opposed the certification application. The usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for a plaintiff to demand defendant produce a plaintiff. The plaintiff could only demand that the defendant provide the plaintiff with a list of names and addresses of all those who had booked with Red Seal during the proposed class. 4) The actual purpose of examining the plaintiff is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys. Rather, it is a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. The examination may lead to a multitude of issues such as production of documents and undertakings and so forth.  5) The Court reviewed the wording of s14 and the general provision allowing the Court to make any order considers appropriate respecting the conduct of class actions to ensure fair and expeditious determination and, for that purpose, may impose on one or more of the parties any terms it considers appropriate. 6) It was important to note that the practices and the implementation of The Rules of Court do not allow the plaintiff to cross examine a defendant on an affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence.  7) It would essentially not make sense for the defendant to have to produce a proper representative plaintiff.  8) The plaintiff was given ample time and opportunity to prepare a detailed response affidavit.  9) In light of the above contextual understanding of the law regarding civil litigation, the usual approach is"
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out.

The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the court and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 2) This appeal from the spousals order was set aside, the respondent's and the appellant's respective incomes, as found or imputed. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. The appellant did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. 3) The appellant was awarded costs against the respondent."

The evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues that warrant compelling his attendance. 2)The Court has already considered whether the accused should testify and on December 4, 2001 quashed a subpoena directing his attendance to give evidence at the Charter Motings hearing.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The judge substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP. This led him down the road to reversible error. The court found that the judge had not erred in law by holding otherwise. The evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same. There was no breach of s.7(1) of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the fruits of the trial. The issue was whether the issuing judge had to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences in order to establish a reasonable and probable grounds for issuing a search warrant. In R. v. Garofoli, [1990] S.C.R. 1421, the Supreme Court held that the test for determining whether a warrant could have been issued became an exercise where the judge ultimately considered whether he would have issued it."

The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs.

The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and education. The Court dealt with the matter orally, after hearing argument, granting the Crown's application to appeal, and allowing the appeal to proceed.  2) The respondent had already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence is to be set aside. The court noted the offender's previous criminal record and the fact that he had served 45 days in custody on remand. 3) The Court noted the respondent's lengthy record of previous offences and his assessment as high risk to re-offend, his inability to be controlled in a non-custodial setting, and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act.  4) The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to indicate that sentence of closed custody must be employed only rarely and in unusual circumstances.  5) It is our respectful view that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was demonstrable unfit. It is the view that under the Act, the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.  6) It may be of note that, given the fact the respondent was not represented, and given the uncertainty of the law just now in the wake of these decisions, not only inform him of his right to appeal this sentence; encourage him to do so, to ensure that he has been given just treatment."

The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring.

The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public.

There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Both individuals were charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession of the marijuana and the other charge was judicially stayed. Brooks applied to have her interest in the Lincoln declared as not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed. 1)The Court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the nature and extent of the interest. 2)It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by her for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S20. The Court must also consider that the applicant (a) is the owner of the motor vehicle and there's some evidence that she may have had knowledge of the existence of the marihuana. The Crown did not provide any evidence adduced at trial to rebut the Crown's assertion that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of a designated substance offence. 3)Section 20(4) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from a forfeiture order pursuant to ss.16(1). Section 20(3) allows the court to order forfeiture of conveyances utilized to transport controlled drugs and substances. That surely cannot constitute cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, but what about those persons who may own, have an interest in, or have a relationship with the forfeitable conveyance and have not been convicted of any substance offence?"
c_1995canlii4546.txt,"The applicant sought a declaration that the province was responsible for providing school buildings for delivery of the public school program and that when buildings must be leased, the province bore the associated costs. The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of Nova Scotia and the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue was whether the Minister of Education (Minister) was required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing these school buildings from the Church. HELD: 1)Where the Minister has received a request in the proper form and determined with the approval of the Minister that it is necessary to lease a school building in order to meet the Province's statutory obligation, the cost of such a lease is the responsibility of the Province.  2)Where there is an inequity where it is required, in order for the Province to provide the school buildings, to lease buildings from third party, in this case the Church, while other boards are provided buildings free of rental cost. It is inconceivable, when read in light of the entire Act, which regularly requires the Minister's approval, that a board could enter into any lease for the rental of buildings for school purposes without the approval or involvement of a Minister. There shall be no costs."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order requiring the father to pay child support in the amount required by the Maintenance and Custody Act. The respondent was the mother of the child. The father argued that the child had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The Court was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it.  2) Section 2(c) of the Act provides that a child may remain dependent even where over the age of majority, if '. unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to withdraw or provide himself with reasonable needs'. It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full time members of the faculty of the respondent immediately. The respondent was a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which managed, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. The applicant was a member of the Faculty Association until he reached the age of 65. He requested reinstatement as a full-time member immediately and requested that the respondent pay him all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest and costs of this proceeding. HELD: 1)The applicants' contention that this creates the degree of governmental control to warrant the application was untenable. That section by 'deeming' is only bringing employees who are not in the public service within the definitions required to be under that pension plan is only for the purposes of that Act. 2)Every jurisdiction in Canada has an anti-discrimination statute which is explicitly made applicable to the Crown. There could be others. 3)The applicant was not mandatorily retired on March 31, 1988 as he claimed. The collective agreement in effect in 1987 provided for the normal retirement date of June 30, 1988. This agreement changed, for the next agreement provided for June 30 1988. It reserved on the matter of damages and was to hear the parties on that issue at a later date. 4)There was no evidence that governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws on behalf of the project. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the mortgagees. In early 1987, the first mortgagee to the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. At the meeting, the defendant suggested that he retain separate legal counsel to deal with the second mortgagee problem and the creditor-suppliers dispute. He requested postponement of the mortgage draws in order to allow for sufficient funds to be disbursed. The plaintiff sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Any claim under this ground is dismissed. The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breached trust and cannot succeed on this ground."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim; two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.  2) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was primarily relying on three cases: Hathway Ross, Stonechild, and Stonechild. The accused had an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which the most serious being the severing of his left jugular vein. That tragically resulted in the landlord bleeding to death for no apparent reason. 3) There were numerous Gladue factors relevant to the accused taken as a whole. The evidence showed that the accused had previously overcome his demons with alcohol and drugs and was very resentful of his community. The Court was not satisfied that the Crown had established that the expression of society's denunciation of white men being rapists and pedophiles was a factor in his decision to plead guilty to manslaughter. It was not necessary or appropriate for the Court to impose a concurrent sentence of 1 year to the ten year sentence the Court had imposed."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters. The corollary relief judgment was made in 1989 except that an order suspending enforcement of arrears during periods when the respondent was unemployed was granted. HELD: 1)The father was ordered to pay child support of $300 per month during months when his gross income was $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when his adjusted gross monthly income was less than $1,200. However, it was clear that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. 2)A flexible order would be appropriate."

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence.

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

To some extent, as well, the requisite 'hurt feelings' can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. 2) Although the plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault, extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required in the future.

e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother who is making an application for joint custody of the two children. HELD: 1) There is no difficulty determining that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest regarding the children. The children are now 10 and 9 years old and the mother has a 'blood tie' to the children, as seven of his nine years have been spent living in the grandmother's home. It is apparent the children have lived with the grandmother for the past nine years. 2) The grandmother has a reasonable and liberal access with the children and she is willing to provide the father with parenting time with them. 3) An interim order was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have supervised access for the children for three weekends in a row with no access on the fourth weekend. The grandmother was granted interim custody in August 2015. 4) The court reviewed the extensive affidavit material filed and heard from counsel on behalf of both the mother and the father. It was clear there were concerns regarding the father's use of alcohol and drugs. The evidence showed that he smoked marijuana and'maybe' hashish but said he never did meth on a regular basis. He opposed the mother's claim for custody and requested a lump sum payment of $69,000. 5) There was an interim order in place in January 2016 that continued the father’s access for two years. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of the Children’S Law Act, 1997, 1997. The designation of the grandmother was not binding when considering whether or not to grant person- sufficient interest status to the grandmother after having heard all of the evidence at trial.  6) The Court was dealing with a request by a third party “friend” of the children to move from the primary care of the mother to his primary care. The parties’ second child, Arty, was born while the mother was in the hospital. He was absent for approximately four years. The father was granted supervised access in January 2015. The matter was adjourned over to the specific date of August 2016."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. The respondent argues that the judgment in that particular requires amendment since there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by counsel for the parties. HELD: The application for fixed costs is dismissed. 1)The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. The court's discretion arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules. Rule 184C allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the Act. 2)The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. 3)The respondent's offer to settle for $47,000 was not appropriate. The total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September 1996 which would result in a reduction in approximately $5,000 in fees and disbursements. In the alternative, the applicant requests a fixed award of costs in order to avoid taxation. 4)The Court is faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was no contract that the judge could enforce. The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)Nothing in the evidence indicates such an intention in this case."

The applicant applied to determine whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia concerning the Quebec accident and to dismiss the action on the basis that Nova Scotia was a forum non conveniens. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the forum conveniens is Nova Scotia. The plaintiff has the prima facie right to select the forum subject to the defendant's right to establish that the forum is non conveniens. In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens. The substantive law governing the proceeding will be the law of the place where the accident occurred and the governing procedural law will be the law of the place of the trial.","The application was for directions as to procedure to govern the future course of conduct of trial in the alternative to determination of a question of law and, secondly, to dismiss the action because Nova Scotia is a forum non conveniens. The only issue was whether the plaintiff was barred from suing in Nova Scotia regarding the motor vehicle accident which occurred in the Province of Quebec. HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs. 1)The plaintiff has a prima facie right to select the forum of his choice. This right is subject to the defendants' right to try to establish that the forum chosen is forum non- conveniens and that a more convenient forum exists elsewhere. 2)The substantive law governing will be the law of the place where the injury occurred. The applicant has chosen Nova Scotia and following the next rule, unless the defendant, that is the applicants here, can show that the province is forum conveniens, the plaintiff's choice of jurisdiction of forum will govern. In the absence of so many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called on behalf of the defendant and the witness likely to call on the plaintiff, the court concluded that that was the question of the law. If there is a procedural problem, a problem arising from procedural law, before or during trial, that problem will undoubtedly be determined in accordance with the procedural law of a place of trial and that is Nova Scotia. Counsel are going to have to find some way of not only getting the law but interpreting the law before the Court here."
c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. The governing provisions contained in s. 303(1) of The Rural Municipality Act, 1989, s. s. 1989-90, which noted that substantial compliance with statutory requirements of this nature can be sufficient, and so the appeal from the decision of the Committee will be allowed with costs as usual and there will be an order directing the board of revisions to hear and determine the company's appeal. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appeal was directed to the Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, which declined to hear the appeal. The Committee ordered that the company appeal be heard by the Board of Revision within 20 days of the mailing or publication of the notice. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to the administrator in the most obvious way, which is to say by simply handing it to the board. The administrator was bound by the terms of the Act to immediately notify everyone affected thereby of the time and place of the board's sittings. The board was bound to entertain the appeal on the footing the property owner had failed to give notice. 2)The wording, purpose, and objectives of the provisions of this subsection are similar to those of the Urban Municipality act, 1984, S.S. 1983-84, referred to in Regina v. Newell Smelski Ltd. (1997), 152 Sask. R. 44. 3)It is difficult to say that the legislature intended that the word give, as distinct from requiring them to serve notice upon, the administrator. This is less formal expression suggesting less exacting term. It is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given by registered mail, applying as it does to almost everyone in every corner of the rural areas of the Province, and falling as a result of the scheme of the enactment."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent. The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. He moved for stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. In response, the Crown filed an affidavit to show disclosure had been made. The affidavit had appended as exhibits the items disclosed, among them, a copy of the criminal record of Mr. Herzberg. The application was dismissed. HELD: The appeal must be allowed. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the basis of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. There is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even though the exact statement alleged to have been made by the accused may not be revealed, it may be properly inferred that there would be no attempt to introduce it into evidence unless it tended to establish the guilt of the accused; the Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 2)The appeal was allowed. The appeal was to be allowed on the grounds that the appeal must allow."
5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","Saskatchewan Government Insurance terminated the benefits of a farmer who suffered soft tissue injuries in a motor vehicle accident. The farmer had received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits pursuant to s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. If it was found that the farmer caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana it was encouraged to consider the farmer's condition as a relapse under s. 142(1)(a)of the Act. SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the farmer prior to October 1 and subsequent failure to reassess his income replacement benefits were significant factors that contributed to his desperate circumstances in October 1997 and resulting in his termination of benefits."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively dismissed from his employment with the defendant. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The plaintiff asserted that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlements for holiday pay. HELD: 1) The jury trial should proceed with respect to the issues of liability and damages. It would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. 2) Any debt for the April 1990 to March 1991 holidays would have arisen within the statutory period of six years. 3) The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish that he was entitled to from April, 1990 to his termination date. 4) The defendant relies on the LSA definition of 'wages' which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. The defendant asserts that the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Labour Standards Act and therefore not entitled to overtime. 5) The court awarded the plaintiff damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination. He also claims that holiday pay owed should be based on his wage, plus one-half his truck expense allowance. 6) The Court awarded the defendant $250,000 for the period April 1988 to October 1997.  7) The defendants claim that if the court finds that the plaintiffs contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum LSA standards, the time the plaintiff spent away from work must be considered holidays. 8) If the Court finds the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.A. 1978, c. L-15 which only allowed recovery of funds under a Contract up to six years after it arises."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused were charged with two counts of defamatory libel relating to a sign that read 'Did a police officer just allow or help with the rape/sodomy of an infant?' and 'If you admit it, then you might get help with your touching problem'. The accused plead not guilty to both counts. HELD: The Court found that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes a limit to freedom of expression which is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by s.300 of the Code, not only the expressions involved in this particular case. 1)The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 2)The accused are found guilty of publishing a plea of justification consisting of 17 typed pages which, for the purposes of this application, need not be reproduced. 3)There is a proportionality to the legislation in that the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly.

The plaintiff's action against the defendants Redden and Lockhart was discontinued as a result of the defendant's decision to discontinue the action against them. Dismissing the action, that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty has been held to exist.

Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,The respondent issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the INFORMATION sworn in support of the application for the application failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location where the search was to be conducted; and (2) substantial compliance with s. 443 was sufficient.
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","HELD: The Court found that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. The legislation attempted to find the non-earner's earning reality. The court found that the IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act.

c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the underlying proceeding is an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The application is opposed by the respondent 2301072 Nova Scotia Limited and the intervenor. The appellants wish to add as ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for the costs application, were not justiciable issues before the chambers judge and should not be raised on appeal; that the torts of champerty and maintenance have been all but eliminated by the common law and are not reasonably necessary to their presentation of their appeal.

b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused had not been responsive to the Crown's request for disclosure. 2) The length of delay was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 3) The prejudice to the accused has been substantial. This is not an excuse for the delay. The accused was unwavering in his desire for a speedy trial. This fundamental principle is often overlooked by the public and especially in highly publicized cases where a public figure is involved. Where no inference as to prejudice can be drawn from the length of the delay or where the most reasonable inference is the other way, the accused may have to call evidence if he is to displace the strong public interest in bringing those charged with an offence to trial."

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.

The applicant was a Roma and Romanian national who had resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminal negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. The applicant appealed the committal order and his application for interim judicial release.

He is a Convention refugee. It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. There is no reason to consider the third test under s.679(3)(c).  2) Turning to the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the applicant, the applicant must establish that his grounds of appeal are not frivolous and the risk of non-appearance is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court at this juncture, he might be able to meet.  3) The Crown concedes that the appellant has met the low threshold in respect of his non-compliance with his 2004 release conditions and his connections to this jurisdiction.

The applicant was granted its costs of the application to be taxed against the plaintiff and the proposed third party.  1)There may well be some delay by allowing the third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceeding, must necessarily result in dismissal. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice.  2)The applicant had no evidence of prejudice. It was contemplated by the parties that if settlement was not achieved, further steps would be taken. The parties agreed through correspondence that: 'Should settlement not be reached at pre-trial, either party may take any further necessary steps that such party deems necessary to prepare for trial.' 3)There was no evidence that the inherent delay would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by either party in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's claims."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court.

The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's counsel put forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1) The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. He directly encouraged others to produce similar stories, which is an aggravating factor in this offence. The fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies of what he wished had done with those two girls when had them under his roof. 2) A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence as the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him. He would not endanger the community if one were imposed. The defendant had no previous criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 3) The Court took into account the mitigating factors referred to in R. v. Cohen, 144 O.A.C. 340 (C.A.) (CanLII) which upheld conditional sentences of 14 months and 18 months respectively for distribution of child pornography."

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward into him. At trial, the Crown called three witnesses and the accused testified that he had received a radio message asking him to assist another officer on a 'non-priority' matter in the south-west part of the province. The defence then called four witnesses, including the accused, to testify that the officer had advised the accused that the most direct route to the area he was called to was via cross-walk, and that the accused had rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside Super Store constituted careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and secondly, his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle was directly in front of the police vehicle. The Crown argued that neither seat belt, belonging to Mr. Tyndall or Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking the officer. The evidence of the Crown's witnesses that neither was waving their arms, or giving any other cause for concern other than the statement to his wife saying 'that vehicle could slow down' did not lock upon impact. The Court reviewed four areas where inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by Crown and defence witnesses. The first issue was whether the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless. Here, we have a pedestrian crossing road adjacent to parking lot, and while walking directly into front of a stopped vehicle, he is then struck by that vehicle as it rolls forward into the vehicle. This driving was careless, as the accused did not intend to harm the officer or cause him to be fired from his employment. The second issue is whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and if so, whether the Court has shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. 2) The Court accepted that the defendant's vehicle was rolled forward less than"

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway. The only issue at trial was whether this made the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on a highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The words'motor vehicle' and 'ruck' in the Act do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the roadway. The word'mobil vehicle' is used within the sections of the motor vehicle to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. When the content, context and purpose of section 287(2), the words'motivator' are used within s.2(m) and 'driver's license' means license issued under this act to drive motor vehicle upon the highway, which is propelled or driven otherwise than by muscular power. It is argued that R. v. Boutilier is authority for the proposition that a person who has been driving a vehicle of type or class for which one can obtain a license to drive it on the road is not a person operating an off-highway vehicle while his license or privilege is cancelled, revoked or suspended."

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","HELD: The court declined to issue summonses as requested. The issues raised by these claims are important issues to the potential Plaintiffs, and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen’s Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made.

Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This was an appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The respondent denied coverage and refused to defend the action in the name and on behalf of the insured on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. The plaintiff was an employee of the respondent and was involved in a motor vehicle accident. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. McLeod, Kellogg and McLeod were sued as result of the auto accident. Royal was under no duty to defend because the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the decision made by the trial judge. The appellant was entitled to considerable deference with respect to how she treated the complainant. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had intentionally driven in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner intended to scare the complainant and her young daughter. The appeal should not be dismissed where, although the accused was not cross-examined at trial and her evidence went in unchallenged, the trial court was entitled in its assessment of the evidence that the appellant's conduct was a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent driver."

He sent monthly invoices to Dobson who paid them as they came. No bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-2006 year. Benson testified that the reason the amount was left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be. He testified that later on we were going to set the price but it never happened. He had heard that some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he felt he couldn't charge that much. He agreed in cross-examination that the bonus was requested by Benson because he didn't know what to charge. He also testified that he never sent a bill to the plaintiff because he was afraid he would charge too much.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process.

Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused sought exclusion of the intercepted evidence on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible because there was no Charter breach. 2)The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code. That the investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. There was no evidence of bad faith. 3)The respondent had sufficient evidence to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The evidence did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. 4)The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive and ought not to be excluded. 5)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Code and the relevant case authorities. It concluded that there is no breach and the evidence is in fact admissible. 6)If there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent -the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence that such a scenario could quite likely result in producing evidence highly relevant to the investigation. The seriousness of the breach was minimal and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: 1) The Court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest in the circumstances of this case. The Court held that because he was a'step-parent' to the petitioner, he did not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' under the Act.  2) The petitioner had already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple'siblings' in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. 3) Access to the respondent is not in the best interests of the petitioner. 4) The court found that because the respondent has a near perfect relationship with the petitioner and that he has always been in the place of parent to her, it cannot conclude that access should be granted to him."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the prison. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault. 1)The accused's actions against the victim were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Crown established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offences against the other two victims. 2)The Crown established the existence of an actual assault is not a prerequisite for defence under s.34(2). Rather, it must ask itself whether the accused reasonably believed, in the circumstances, that she was being assaulted. 3)The Court established the mental element. The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm. If the accused was a joint principal offender, he was liable as both a 'joint principal offender' and a'secondary offender' pursuant to s. 21(1)(b) that reads in full. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. In all of the circumstances of this case, the Crown has established that bodily harm to Dorion was objectively foreseeable by him as a consequence to the plot to which he was party. He admitted that his intention was to hurt the victim so that he would not hurt himself. 4)The court established the subjective perceptions of the accused. It is clear from the video, the evidence of corrections officers and the testimony of Knife that he was mixing with the other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. It does not need to establish that he knew that something was about to happen and that it was going to be 'bad'. It is reasonable to conclude that he acted in concert and for a common purpose."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside its default judgment on the basis of forum non conveniens. The defendant corporation had entered into a letter agreement with the plaintiff to represent its share of the plaintiff's energy savings, which it claimed was entirely unrelated to any advice from the defendant and were, instead, the result of price reductions offered by its own suppliers of fuel. The plaintiff paid the defendant what the defendant terms a deposit and service fee and agreed to pay Fifty Percent of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were not part of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. Although technically the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default under Civil Procedure Rule 12.03 (1), because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant."

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank.

The respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that the amount of the deficiency judgment should be $162,675. This amount was calculated as follows: $536,186.72 total amount owed to March 23, 2016 ($372,485.01); $87,711.00 balance owed and amount of deficiency judgment III.

The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties.

The secondary residence and primary residence were to be supervised by the respondent and the respondent had access to his son on the three days each week he was off work. The applicant was to pay child support of $89 per month for the first year and $96 per month thereafter for the second year. The child care costs for the interim residence and child maintenance were to include the respondent's pro-rata share of $7,393 for the two year period and $89 for the annual maintenance schedule. HELD: 1)The respondent's primary caretaker was the primary caregiver for the child. 2)The primary residence of the respondent was with the petitioner. 3)S.W.S. remained in primary care of the petitioner for the duration of the interim custody proceedings. 4)The petitioner's attendance at the Apollo clubhouse was reduced from four hours per day to four hours. 5)The court found that the petitioner had total disregard of the child's well being on the date she attempted to commit suicide. The court ordered that the respondent have access at all times on the third and fourth days of each week."
5_2001skqb98.txt,"Issues of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgment given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. The petitioner claimed an interest in the standing crops. The respondent argued that he had only completed seeding on one-third of the land when he left. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support (including the extra costs) of $948.00 per month. 2)The petitioner's income from her employment in restaurant was $798.00. She also paid $400 per month for play school. The total costs of $440.00 were to be paid by the respondent in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support, the income of the petitioner and the petitioner will be nearly the same, it is agreed that the respondent stands in loco parentis in respect of the respondent."
8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff commenced operations in late July 1985 and continued until terminated without prior notice by the defendant on March 11, 1986. The plaintiff brought this action claiming reimbursement of monies advanced to the plaintiff under the contract and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses caused by the plaintiff's unjustified termination of the contract, and as extras, and for which it has never been paid. HELD: 1) The nature of the work was essentially the same as it would have been if the wording in the original invitation for tenders had been used. The contractual obligation to'maintain the banks' was to be construed by the wording of the tender and any variation in wording between the 1984 invitation and the 1985 invitation for tender was inconsequential. 2) The plaintiff was awarded the contract with the option of cancelling the contract without notice. The contract was terminated without any prior notice.  3) The defendant was awarded monies and expenses advanced to it under the tender.  4) Roper was to reimburse the plaintiff for monies it incurred in equipment rentals or other activities related to the contract due to the failure by Roper to perform under it.  5) There was no ambiguity as to whether the contract was a contract between the parties or a contractual contract between a company and a corporation. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover monies from the plaintiff and for expenses incurred by the corporation as a result of its failure to perform its contract obligations.  6) The court awarded the plaintiff monies for equipment rental and other expenses which the plaintiff claimed were required due to Roper's failure to comply with the contract obligations and for services it performed under it as extras."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. Given her age the parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between the Father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. HELD: 1) The evidence before the court was that the Father was from another country and still had family living in Nova Scotia. The evidence did not suggest he would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for their daughter and remove her permanently from Nova Scotia and the fact that the mother had recently moved into her mother's apartment taking the child with her did not support the idea that supervised access was in the child's best interests.  2) The court found that the evidence was insufficient to categorize the violence that occurred between the parties during the incident in question, nor the other unpleasant events that have occurred in their relationship, as domestic violence requiring the father's access to be supervised. 3) The Court ordered that the father attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent."
e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement made shortly after her arrest. HELD: The Crown sought to use the prior statement, but for thedemonstrably false portion, as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial. 1)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 2)There was insufficient solemnity attached to the occasion of the oath to bring home to her the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement. The statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B., supra. 3)The reliability threshold can be met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. The reliability threshold is not met even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of her statement is false. The form should not override substance. 4)It follows that the statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its witnesses. It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an officer who has provided consistent testimony what portions of such statement they wish to accept."

The trial judge found that both were true and awarded damages equivalent to 5 months notice for the wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence supports the trial judge's finding that the pre-contractual representations made by the respondent (and KPMG) were truthful, accurate and not misleading. The decision reveals no palpable and overriding error, indeed, the evidence supports his findings.  2) The Court of Appeal must not interfere with trial decision making. It is unnecessary in these factual circumstances to consider, had misrepresentation been negligently made, whether clause 13 would bar recovery in tort."

HELD: 1) The plaintiff has failed to identify the legislative scheme by which responsibility for education in Ile a la Crosse or specifically, responsibility for education of a group of people that included the plaintiff, was delegated to the Minister of Education or any other member of executive government. The Government is entitled to know the case it has to meet. If the plaintiff knows the statute and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars. If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government of Saskatchewan (the Government) sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.

The conduct of examinations for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action. The pleadings support a claim for damages for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of trust.  1) The Government relies on R.E.L. v. Saskatchewan where the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation' were struck. However, the plaintiff cites samples of cases involving similar open ended phrases and submits that such wording is common and should be permitted by the courts. 2) In the circumstances here, the conduct of the examinations is sufficient for the plaintiff to know the case it has to meet. If the Plaintiff knows the statutes and regulations on which he relies, he must provide particulars of same.
