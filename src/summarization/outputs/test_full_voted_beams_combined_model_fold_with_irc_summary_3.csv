The appellant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault following a dispute in a trailer where the two girls were living with their mother. He denied assaulting the complainants and sentenced him to 9 months in prison followed by 2 years probation. He appealed the convictions on the 1st and 2nd counts. The Court found no error on the part of the trial judge in conducting the trial or in weighing the evidence. The issue on appeal was the matter of credibility. In assessing the evidence the court could not say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and accordingly the appeal was dismissed.,"The appellant was convicted of indecent assault against two young girls. He appealed on five grounds related to a substantial conflict in the evidence.

"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to this Court. He was convicted at trial on the basis of the testimony of his estranged wife and their daughter, whose accounts of what occurred were accepted by the trial judge. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he was not a credible witness. The appellant took the appeals himself. He contended he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he has evidence that his estranged Wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally.  1)There are certain procedures that have to be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. These procedures were not followed. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts as found, based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed.

"The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff sought a change of place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor, in the area where the dispute arose. The defendant, Sterling Farm, argued that the attachment order caused Sterling Farm to shut down and that it was trying to hinder or delay its creditors. The plaintiff, which operated out of Stewiacke, said neither party had a connection with Halifax and that the matter should be heard in Windsor, where it had been held for several years. In addition, it argued that a reference to another document was not the same as in a defence filed in an action. HELD: 1) The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil.  2) The plaintiff did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The prothonotary filed in the cause was not a proven instrument under rule 44.02 and, therefore, could not be relied upon as supporting the admissibility of the claim. 3) Costs were awarded to the applicant in any event in the Cause.","The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.",6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor.

"The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01. There is a total of alterations of preprinted material and one alteration of writing contained within one of the blanks. Of the five initialled changes, four are initialled. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(1(g)(i) that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. If Parliament had intended the contrary to be the case, it would have specifically stated that an approved instrument needed to be identified, just as it did with respect to the alcohol standard. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be afforded the Crown, it must be set out in the certificate or proven by other evidence. 2)There was insufficient evidence to identify the alleged approved instrument. It was not sufficiently advanced in the circumstances to advance the case beyond the weight of the certificate. 3)The accused's model did not adequately or adequately describe the instrument. There was no evidence of the model's ability to accurately or adequately identify the instrument or its model. 4)No weight was given to the model in the Certificate of Analysis and the accused was acquitted of all three charges.","The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration.

"FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted interim custody with specified access. The petitioner requested that the child support be based on his 2005 income. Given the age and circumstances of the children and the fact that the petitioner had not seen the children for ten months, it was uncontroverted that the father had not been seen for the past ten months. 2) Retroactive child support was warranted. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties that the respondent would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. The parties based their verbal agreement on the petitioner's 2004 income. It is common for support provisions to be based upon the prior year's earnings. 3) The petitioner was awarded interim child support arrears of $8,107. 4) The court found nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. 5) The parties had discussed the adoption of a retroactive order pursuant to s. 18 of The Children's Law Act. The Court ordered that the retroactive orders be paid retroactively to January 2006. 6) The Court was not prepared to deduct the $9,600 from the respondent's 2006 income.","FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.",4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005.

"The landlord appealed an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. The landlord had refused to renew for another year and the tenant sought to convert the lease to a month-to-month tenancy. Landlord and tenant both appealed; in the end the court allowed the appeal and declared the tenancy to have been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused to consent in a timely manner. The parties had agreed on a timeline and the court found that it would not be unreasonable for the landlord to refuse to renew the lease for a further year. The court allowed both the landlord and tenant appeals and declared that the tenancy had not been converted. The appeal court found the landlord had erred in law in that he did not give reasonable reasons for his decision, but in practice he had not given reasonable reasons. The tenant had been advised that the lease would terminate sooner than he expected and he had no inclination to delay.","The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.",d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31.

"FIAT. The husband sought to vary the May 2002 child support order on the basis that his income had decreased as a result of being laid off from his employment, that the parties' oldest child was no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that his s. 7 expenses had not been incurred for more than a year. The wife opposed the application arguing the layoff was only temporary and that the child continued to be a child of the marriage and that she had no obligation to contribute to the child's extracurricular activities. HELD: 1) The husband's obligation to pay child support of $534 per month for both children and $60 for the son's hockey, golf and baseball expenses was terminated effective March 31, 2003. 2) The wife's position warranted an assessment of costs. 3) The father's income had increased since the May 2, 2002 consent judgment. The unreasonableness of the wife warrants an assessment. 4) The parties' eldest child had been unemployed for over 2 weeks with vague knowledge of when he would be rehired. The school year began in May 2002 and the child was in full-time attendance at a post-secondary institution by the end of March 2003. 5) The respondent's s.7 expenses (hockey, golf, baseball and soccer) were increased. 6) The applicant's income for child support purposes was $37,416. 7) The court found that the wife ceased to be an 'child of themarriage' within the Meaning of the Act effective March 2003 because of the husband's continued absence from work and the wife's failure to terminate the husband’s contribution for his hockey, soccer and baseball expense.","FIAT.

"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue of the sale and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof have been decided by the Court. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply an adjustment to the owner's property. There is no doubt in the present case the first prerequisite is law. The questions as recast them are clearly questions of law. For a question to be sufficiently meritorious to place before the Court either the judge hearing the application for leave must have a doubt, if not serious doubt, about whether the tribunal appealed from correctly decided the question or the question must be of such broad importance that it deserves the attention of and determination by a higher authority irrespective of whether the judge has any doubt about the correctness of the tribunal's resolution.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act.

The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance from the respondent husband. The parties owned three separate properties at the time of the separation. One of the properties was purchased with proceeds from the sale of the Chicago property but broke down en route and was abandoned because the cost of repairs would have exceeded the value of the vehicle. The respondent husband cross-appealed claiming that the property was given to him by his sister and he overstated the purchase price of the property. The trial judge found this to be a palpable and overriding error and dismissed the appeal and the cross application without costs. Both parties' affidavits were found to be true. The court found no palpable or overriding error in the standard of review as the evidence was readily available at trial and there would not be the same opportunity for direct and cross-examination related to the evidence which was available for the trial.,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia.

"The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted the day after the Justice R.D. Maher changed the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. The respondent argues that there has been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister.

HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated.

"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant to provide banking, blending and lifting of coal at its coal preparation plant. The defendant was the successful bidder. The plaintiff sued for damages in the amount of $270,307.05 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract. Roper appealed, arguing that the judge erred in finding that the defendant was in breach of the contract and in holding that it was not entitled to rely on the exclusion from liability provisions in the contract. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the cross-appeal, that both parties had breached the contract, Roper by failing to perform and Devco by not providing the approximate tonnages set out therein. The trial judge found that even if the defendant had performed the contract the plaintiff would have continued to operate at loss. As a result, the judge held that the plaintiff did not suffer any loss as a result of the termination of the contracts.

In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed.

There is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly administer.  4) Having before this Court an application seeking revocation of a grant of proate, and an ordered that the will be proven IN solemn form, it is incumbent on the executor to act promptly in respect of his application, should he decide to proceed with that application.

The plaintiff was warned of the impending deadline and asked to continue to hold the funds pending a further order of the Court. Counsel for Key sought costs in any event of the cause on the basis that the default judgement was set aside ex debito justitiae. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim. Even under the Moir J. approach to the interpretation of s. 2(3)(b), the power of Council was not exercised 'pursuant' to the consent of majority of councillors present at a meeting. There was no meeting as required by the legislation. 2) In exercising the judicial discretion under Rule 9-13, the court must also conclude that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key's then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending against the action is insufficient to deny Key its day in court.","HELD: The application was granted.

"The respondent applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The respondent responds through its counsel that it now has every intention to proceed with its action. HELD: 1) A delay of over five years is inexcusable and it does not reach the level of serious prejudice described in the ICC case. However, it is in the interests of justice that the claim proceed to trial notwithstanding the delay.  2) The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim is comparable to that experienced by other cases in which the decision to dismiss is discretionary. As was the case in ICC, this case has now seen the completion of all pre-trial steps excepting for the response to certain undertakings given and still outstanding and the scheduling of pre- trial settlement conference. Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed without further delay. 3) The delay in excess of five years in advancing this case does constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases.  4) The onus is on the respondent to convince the court that the facts and circumstances support the conclusion that the delay was excusable. The application for an order returning $40,000 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid is not granted.

"The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused argued that since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting off a driving error, the court need not enter the analysis of whether the accused had de facto care or control of an inoperative motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person that was occupying the driver's seat was incapable of providing a sample of his breath and that he required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2)Although the accused may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused and, in coming to his conclusion, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the potential seriousness of the assault, the head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and the length of time it would take to treat the victim and keep him under observation. 3)All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle pursuant to ss.255 and s253(b). 4)There was no evidence of impairment by reason of his physical condition which would justify a demand for a sample. The evidence established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. 5)The Court held that it would be unfair to deprive the accused of his s. 10(b) right to counsel in any way. Given the circumstances of the accident and the accused's condition at the scene, it was not unreasonable to expect the accused to sleep in the vehicle at the time of the demand.  6)The court found that there was no reasonable person's question as to his ability to operate the vehicle with respect to his health and safety. The only question was whether he was able to fully exercise his rights or fully exercise them when he spoke to a lawyer","The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.",5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code.

The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way."

"The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of The Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: 1)Section 146(2)(c.3) of the PPSA does not apply to the applicant. The taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes s. 146(3) and the Income Tax Act. 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having retired. The commutation and surrender provisions did not apply. 3)The application for a restraining order was denied. 4)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. If it did, such provision would violate s.146(12) and s.8.03 of the Act. 5)Since the applicant has not retired, there appears to be a no-monetary sum current for the Crown to set off, unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by the applicant by her.  5)The provisions of s.7.02 of the Plan Contract specifically provides that upon an annuitant's coverage terminating, the annuitants' account is to remain with the insurer and the proceeds of the account are to be used to purchase a qualifying annuity or transferred to a registered retirement income fund (RRIF) authorized by the government. 6)Section 7.02 provides that Crown Life is entitled to attach the resulting proceeds pursuant to the terms of the plan in the same manner as the secured party did in Phenix. 7)Since Ms. Corscadden has not been retired and no pension refund exists, there appear to be other arrangements for the proceeds to be paid to the Crown in the form of a lump sum transfer to another depository in accordance with subsection 146(1)of the Income tax Act. 8)Pursuant to s.2(c)(3)The provision that the applicant shall have no right to assignment or a pledge of her interest under the Group plan and therefore be entitled to a pension refund, if a proper request is made by her, Crown Life shall be responsible for paying the lump sum to the designated Transferee. 9)Allowing the application for restraining order denied","The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security.

"The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the primary residence being with the mother. The petitioner wishes to move with the child from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move. The issues on the proposed relocation are whether it is in the children's best interests to relocate the child to Edmonton with the respondent; if so, what is an appropriate access schedule for the child in Edmonton. HELD: 1) The child's psychological parent and psychological home was with the petitioner. The respondent's primary residence was with her. 2) Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the future, the child was not allowed to relocate to Edmonton. 3) The respondent was allowed to have access to the child on one weekend per month even though his current residence was in the city of Saskatoon. The child would no longer benefit from the access schedule provided by the respondent. 4) The court was cognizant of the fact that the respondent's reasons for relocating were only relevant in exceptional circumstances where it impacts on the parent's ability to meet the child's needs.","The parties separated in October 2003.

"The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and the decision by the Minister to make the present application was not taken in haste. The mother, who had separated from the husband and was much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all of their children, had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) since the birth of the oldest child. She had been relying on the husband for support throughout the years. He had been sentenced to prison for sexual assault, and the wife had pleaded guilty to domestic disharmony charges. HELD: The children were permanently committed to the mother. 1)An application was made under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act permanently committing the mother to the father. 2)The mother was not able or unwilling to take action to protect the children. She was in denial of this or to excuse it. 3)The evidence showed that the mother was incapable of supervising or protecting the children and that her failure to do so would result in further harm to the children emotionally. She did not have the competency to care for all three children on her own.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.",e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister.

"Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The evidence from the child protection worker was that the mother was mentally ill and abusive to the children and that the father should be made aware that she had custody of them.  1) Although the mother's recognition of past problems with depression and her progress in dealing with it through medication and counselling, the Court found that the tapes had the opposite effect. They spoke volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. The tapes were primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The keynote theme, as orchestrated by the father, is that the Mother is deranged and violent but the father will always be there to rescue the children. The children have no fear of either parent. 2) The father has no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He has exploited the children's unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. Even his current partner is blunt in her analysis of the situation. She was present during some of the exchanges. She heard the tapes and found them to be quite extreme. 3) The tape recordings were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified. The Court was of the opinion that only by hearing the tapes, if they were taped, could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children (M.M.D.). The father had been on employment insurance for a short time and subsequently obtained brief employment in the construction industry but he continued to default in his maintenance payments. The mother was to have access on his scheduled days off work.","Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.",c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute.

"The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carry on a family farm operation and operate a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages. The petitioner accountant, who had advised the brothers that they should become involved, alleged that the petitioner had committed an act of bankruptcy within the six months prior to their filing of the petition. HELD: 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amounts claimed. He had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. It was common ground that the respondent had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. No adequate explanation had been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his obligation. 2)As the petitioner was awealthy individual who was quite capable of paying his debts but had simply chosen not to do so. He earned over $1.4 million in his last four years as a professional hockey player in the NHL and had saved a total of $108,625.65 in personal tax liability.  3)It was Appropriate for the Bankruptcy Court to grant a receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner's partners as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. 4)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant such an order.","Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996.

"In October 2014, Turcotte J. ordered the defendant to pay retroactive child support to his former wife in the amount of $21,645. The parties agreed in May 2011 to vary the 2011 Variation Order to reflect the amount payable pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines. In December 2011, the defendant abandoned his request to change the primary residence of his ex-wife to that of his current one. He applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order varying the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to include the change in custody of his two children. The Court found in December 2011 that the defendant had exceeded his means in paying the child support he was owed for the period from January 2009 to August 2012 inclusive. In May 2011, a variation order was issued which reduced the defendant’s monthly child support payment to $950 from $1,000 per month. The defendant filed an application for variation of the variation order in which he alleged that he had been required to pay $2,000 less per month in the previous variation order and that he should not have instructed his solicitor to consent to it. The applicant argued that the trial judge erred by misapprehending facts when he found the defendant did not advise him of changes to his circumstances and by failing to find unreasonable delay. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Saskatchewan courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. 2)Canadian courts have not followed Frey. In his decision regarding the 2006 consent order, he held that there was no expressly legislated power to vary an interim order on an application pursuant to s.17 of the Divorce Act. In this case, the court referred to the decision in Frey Frey (1987), 1987 CanLII 4734 (SK CA), RFL (3d) 154 (Sask.) at para 12. The court reviewed the various orders of the Court in the past 10 years and found that: 1)The Court found that the parties had not reached an agreement on the extent to which the defendant was entitled to vary his consent order in accordance with the Guidelines; 2)There was no evidence that either party was aware of the material changes to their circumstances; 3)The defendant failed to inform the plaintiff of the 2009 material changes or to have adjusted his child support accordingly. 4)The court found that a consent order can only be varied if it is necessary to change circumstances. 5)A spousal","Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.",4_2015skca111.txt,"The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645.

"The appellant appealed the trial judge's decision regarding custody and access. He argued that the trial court erred in law in that the decision was made to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column 5. The court cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody andaccess. The welfare of the appellant would be better served by spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.",6_2004skca37.txt,"[3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'.

"The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found guilty of both charges. 1) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There was no doubt that the accused were the aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows. He chased after the complainant with Dagenais' help. Once at the trailer he rushed up the stairs toward the defendant. This was threatening behaviour and the defendant said he felt threatened. As the complainant said in his testimony, the defendant was not there to apologize. The accused both admitted to breaking the front passenger window and breaking the rear window. However, the Crown was unable to prove the cost of repairing the windows was under $5,000. There being no evidence of an essential element of the offence, the Court found the accused not guilty of the second count on information 24414281. 2) The Court found both accused guilty of assault upon the complainant. The first count was dismissed. The second count was stayed.","The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault.

"A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault. He appealed the conviction submitting that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was ample evidence which, if believed, justified the conviction. The judge applied the proper test and did not apply his or her mind to the possibility that despite having rejected the appellant's evidence, there might nevertheless be a reasonable doubt about guilt. The court applied the correct standard of proof to the whole of the evidence.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.",c_2004nsca135.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, with the only live issue at trial being whether the Crown had proved the absence of the complainant's consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

"The appellant appealed a decision of the Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code which found that the appellant continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services to wheelchair users and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet the accessibility requirements of the National Building Code of Canada 1995.[1] The appellant appeals contending that the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order that it did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with cost on double Column V. 1)The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by the Court of Appeal. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The Board acted within jurisdiction in hearing evidence which went to the issue of whether the appellant consulted or did not consult with the Commission and to determine whether the renovations completed by the appellant met the order with the result that it ceased to contravene the Code. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to external access of the property or to other 'facilities and services', and whether it had been complied with is the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. 2)The appellants appealed the decision of Matheson J. to this Court on essentially the ground that he erred in failing to find that the board had exceeded its jurisdictional jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.","A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order.

"The defendant was charged with the death of his 15 passengers and 3 others when his car veered off the road and struck a power pole. The plaintiffs sued the defendant, alleging negligence in the ownership and operation of the vehicle. The defendant argued that there was no evidence supporting his claim that he owned the dog that ran onto the highway and therefore the claim against him should be dismissed summarily. He argued that the chambers judge erred in describing the affidavit as a second part of the test, which he did not refer to. The chambers judge dismissed the application. The application for summary judgment was dismissed. The court found that the defendant met the second part and then that the plaintiffs met the onus on them in the second portion of the tests. The Chambers judge seemed to blur the two parts of the evidence, namely the affidavit and the statement of the officer who testified. The onus was not on the defendant to prove the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit.","A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway.

"HELD: The petitioner was granted joint custody with the mother with primary residence with the father and access for the mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in January 2013 contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under the Family Property Act, S 1997, C-8.2, joint custody of Z. and S. to be with the wife and child support for the father set aside for 6 months. The interim agreement provided that the parties would have Z. in the interim care of the mother and that the respondent would receive parenting time. The mother was to have her own home. The father was to pay child support and the parties had been locked out. HELD: 1)The mother was concerned that the father was holding her child from her and that she needed to end the relationship. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back to her house. 2)The father was in constant pain and the mother was afraid to get out of his house. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had followed the interim agreement which provided that all materials would be provided to the petitioner. 5)The evidence from the parties’ lawyers was that although the father had not seen the child for some time, he was often verbally abusive, grabbing the petitioner and hugging her and saying things like “I’m sorry” and “Get out of here!” The petitioner’s counsel had accurately summarized the verbalizations in the statement of mind given by the father that the child would not be able to sleep with her for several days because of the restrictions placed on his access to the computer and the Internet. 6)The petitioner was awarded one-half of the day and one-third of the parenting time that was to be paid for by the respondent. 7)The respondent was ordered to pay $600 in child support, the cost of the settlement and the costs of the application. 8)The wife was to bring the child to her home in Warman and the respondent was to provide the other half of the household with necessities such as books, toys and books. 9)The child was to spend one day with his mother in her home. 10)The parents would have access on a shared week-on/week basis until trial could be held","The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act.

"The plaintiff Seeds claims damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff Seeds attempts to have matching contracts for the quantum of specialty crops required with various producers with options for differing times of delivery to match the demand of the purchaser and to meet the delivery date requirements in the sales contracts. HELD: 1)The plaintiff did not receive an executed copy of the contract. In addition to the fax, the plaintiff used the mail to communicate the offer to the defendant and it should therefore have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive the fully executed copy back in the mail. 2)In the instant case the plaintiff signed the contract and faxed a copy to Farr. The contract was signed by both parties in May 1993 and both parties considered that they had a binding and legally enforceable contract in May and in November 1993. In November 1993 the plaintiff telephoned Farr and found out he could sell the canary seed for more than double the contract price and he wanted to hold the sale for better price. 3)In all discussions prior to January 1994 the plaintiff had received a copy of each contract. Each person now put their own slant on the deal. The post office was legitimate agent of Johnson Seeds for the purpose of communicating the acceptance of the offer and the copy was never received. If Farr is now seeking to break the contract he must insist that it be expressly stated in the contract before he executes the same. 4)If the plaintiff is wrong and if he has a valid contract with Johnson Seeds he may have thought that he might have to pay the defendant 10ï¿½ per pound less the contract amount. 5)Johnson Seeds knew in January 1994 that the contract was in breach and this is when the defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff.","The plaintiff, a specialty seed marketing company, claimed damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. Johnson Seeds entered contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting to secure product for resale. After extended negotiations the defendant eventually signed and mailed the standard form contract but never received an executed copy. The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem.

"The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and the still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that his expert's opinion should not have been introduced by the Crown. He also argued that there was a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. Dismissing the action for negligence and breach of contract, that the video was a very good example of how the facts presented to the jury could be explained. It was also a very timely appeal, which allowed the Court to review the expert's report and find that, in some respects, the video's admission should have been made sooner rather than later.","The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case.

The administrator of the municipality advised council that the plaintiff had moved a motion to tender the contract for building inspection services which had failed to comply with the plaintiff's requests to remedy his deficiencies. Council convened to discuss the issue. During the meeting, the administrator received legal advice from the mayor's administrator regarding the possible conflict of interests and the plaintiff brought an application to have the administrator revoke the sanctions she had imposed upon her. Application to quash the sanctions dismissed; the plaintiff did have another remedy open to him, which was to apply to the action against the defendant. The defendant was acting in her personal capacity and did not act in good faith in imposing the sanctions. The plaintiff failed to establish that she acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff; the defendant is not liable to the plaintiff pursuant to the tort of misfeasance in public office. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court was not prepared to award damages to the defendant and enable him to gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. 1)The dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant was a political one. A court should not be reluctant to get involved. The dispute is best left to the ratepayers to deal with at municipal election.  2)The plaintiff was not seeking damages for her actions. She was acting with the express purpose of demonstrating a personal injury to her reputation and feelings, and thus causing her to gain personal benefit. She did not establish that the defendant acted with a sense of personal liability or that she had received legal guidance in her capacity in order to impose sanctions upon her in the course of carrying out her duties as councillor.  3)The court could not decide on damages or costs.","The plaintiff alleges the defendant has injured his reputation and feelings, and has caused the plaintiff humiliation and distress, through her actions as Reeve of the Council of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care.

"At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude them. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make a roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Charter; whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence leading to such a demand; and whether the certificate of analysis could be relied upon to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. HELD: The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. Based upon the evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle, the Court was persuaded that the words 'has alcohol in your body' were insufficient to determine that the police officer had the reasonable suspicion that the accused motorist had consumed alcohol. Based on the previous admission by the accused that she consumed alcohol, together with the other evidence he had on hand, he believed he was justified in making the breath demand. The Court was also persuaded that there was insufficient evidence upon which to convict in regard to the second count, which was also a Charter breach.","The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand.

The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.

"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the respondent’s position on the matter was not blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner category.  1)The respondent”s position was that he had agreed with the previous two consent orders that they would continue to share the custody and care of both of their children, Meghan and Ryan, as well as his special and/or extraordinary costs. 2)The petitioner”d not disclose her income tax return”(s. 25) or any current information about the status of the child” (failing to do so) within the meaning of s. 25 of the Guidelines. 3)There was no agreement or obligation to disclose. The petitioner had been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. 4)Relying on the Supreme Court” s. 15.1(7) for its reasoning, the court found that the petitioner was not in breach of the 2003 agreement. 5)The fact that the parties had agreed on the table amount for the child in 1996 was not grounds to vary the amount of support in 2004. The respondent“s delay between June 2004 and July 2006 (the first time the respondent broached the issue of revising child support by sending a letter to the petitioner) was a reasonable excuse for inaction.  6)Reasonable excuse for not seeking a variation was not sought. The annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum were not so significant that the mother would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 7)The court was unable to find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that he accepted $380.","The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.

The evidence at the trial did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties. HELD: The claim was dismissed.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence, taken together with the exhibits, did not assist the court in reaching a determination regarding the issues of negligence and legal liability. 2)The evidence was equivocal.

"Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. Following a jury conviction, the applicant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. The latter were both upheld on appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) The trial court was not persuaded that the appellant's arguments were misplaced. When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that, if the appellant could have outrun the Constable, this would suggest that the Constable who had been driving the Tempo had been the more experienced officer and therefore less likely to be called to testify. The appellant's concerns were rooted in part of the charge where the trial judge told the jurors they could decide for themselves whether the individual depicted in the photographs was the driver of the white Tempo. The jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the Crown's credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court noted that this was not a case where the convictions turned exclusively on eye witness evidence. The appeal court was unable to conclude that either of the appellant’s convictions were unreasonable or were in excess of the total sentence imposed.","The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence.

"The accused was presented with an indictment containing five counts. At the arraignment the Crown stayed counts and gave him a credit of double time. The accused pled guilty to three counts. The count amounts to fraudulently and without colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of a Credit card to credit card users contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and two counts of theft of goods of a value exceeding $5,000. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. HELD: The accused was sentenced to four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly. 1) The offences were very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offence was committed over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. 2) The accused pleaded guilty. While it was long time in coming, it has avoided lengthy trial and the attendant expense. What is more important is the dollar value of the goods and services realized and the total deprivation inflicted. 3) The Court held that sentencing the accused to consecutive sentences of eight years and six months would be a priority. 4) It would be perverse to deprive an offender of liberty when he is sentenced to two years and three months consecutive to the preceding sentences. 5) The Crown should have given a credit for four years, nine months, or a global sentence of 10 years and 9 months because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. The discretion to grant the credit remained with the Court despite s. 719(3) and (4) of The Criminal Code because they were both set-off in the context of the same criminal record. 6) The gravity of the offences was very high, because of the numerous offences and because the place from which the crimes originated. 7) The conduct of the accused was most unusual, even bizarre, as it occurred while he was in prison. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be 8 years and 6 months. The combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh; 7) the objectives of sentencing, as stated in the Code, are rehabilitation. 8) It is denunciation and deterrence, both accused and others, which must be emphasized and obtain a priority; any other approach would being the administration of justice into dis","The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders.

"This was an appeal from a decision of the trial judge interpreting s. 89(1) of the Indian Act to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent Band under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The trial judge held that s.89(1)(b) was applicable and set aside the provisions of s.87(1). He also held that the respondent had priority over the second assignee in the sense that the conditional sales agreements covered by the previous contract between the respondent and the defendant should be affected by the subsequent assignment of Fagel's book debts. The appeal was allowed. All the assignments which were made by the Respondent pursuant to the Construction Contract with the Receiver were void. S.89 (1) was not intended to prevent an Indian from entering into normal financing agreements in conjunction with the operation of commercial business. The act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. When an Indian is in business he holds and deals with his or her business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. The protection afforded by s.84(1 of the Act for the purposes of registration under the Act was limited and the respondent could deal with his accounts receivable as any other Indian on a reserve.","This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed.

Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments.

"The Crown obtained a warrant to search for blood samples from the Peace in January 2009. The warrant resulted in blood samples being taken from the accused. The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and while his blood alcohol concentration at the time of the accident was.08. At trial, the accused testified that he thought the accused had been driving his vehicle that early morning, the vehicle had been in an accident, it was apparent that the accused was drinking alcohol, and that he was in no condition to consent to providing samples of his breath. At issue was whether the Information to Obtain Blood Sample Report should be admitted into evidence at trial; whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report were sufficient grounds to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds exist for the warrant to issue. HELD: 1) The Crown and the accused agreed that the officer should testify on a voir dire for the purpose of the Court making the determination of the validity of the warrant and the admissibility of the certificate of analyst. 2) The officer failed to communicate this basic information to the Justice. 3) There was a breach of the accused's s. 8 Charter right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter. The officer's testimony concerning the accident and the fact that the driver of the vehicle was unconscious when he was extracted from the vehicle and was found to be strongly of beverage alcohol did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief the accused committed an offence under s.253. Further, the officer's attendance at the scene at the accident site was affected by the impact of a power pole on the vehicle. 4) Blood samples were taken at a hospital and a pre-arranged hearing was held. 5) A warrant was issued for the officer to search the vehicle for blood. He was required to provide his reasonable ground of belief in the driver's condition and in the manner in which he believed the alcohol was administered to the driver. The information to be obtained was a technical error which could not be fixed on a trial basis.  6) The oath sworn by the officer was not fatal to the warrant as it did not include the source of his belief the driver was not wearing a seat belt or the reliability of that belief.

The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle.

"The respondent purchased a sailing vessel in 1988 and sailed to the Carribean where it remained until 1989. The vessel was used as a charter vessel in Maine and the Carribbean. In 1990 an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board, which concluded in January 1991 that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the Province to attract tax under s.7(1) of the Act. The Minister appealed the decision of the Board which held that the yacht was not subject to tax under the Act and that s.8 of the Health Services Tax Act applied. Appeal dismissed without costs.","A sailboat, which was owned by a resident in Nova Scotia and registered in the province, but which was purchased in Finland and kept in the United States and the Carribean, and which was twice in Nova Scotia under customs permits to participate in races, did not have a sufficient presence in the province to be subject to an assessment under the Health Services Tax Act.",8_1991canlii2444.txt,"A sailboat, which was owned by a resident in Nova Scotia and registered in the province, but which was purchased in Finland and kept in the United States and the Carribean, and which was twice in Nova Scotia under customs permits to participate in races, did not have a sufficient presence in the province to be subject to an assessment under the Health Services Tax Act."
"The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for dependent benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers’ Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that her husband had died while he was performing work duties at the University of Saskatchewan. The respondent Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the applicant was not advised by anyone that she might have any potential entitlement to benefits from the Board as result of the death of the applicant; and third, that there were no life signs at the time of the application. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The standard of review is the'mere error' of law standard and not the 'patently unreasonable' standard. 2)Section 45(1)(b) does not bar the board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' (see Baker v. Canada). 3)The principles of the law and workers' compensation principles in general, particularly those relating to the use of the term 'found dead' in reference to the deceased, were reviewed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in its decision on November 20, 2002. The privative clause did not apply in this case as s.45 did not bar it in the sense prescribed by the legislation. 4)S.45 is not a discretionary decision and, in the circumstances, should not be exercised in accordance with the boundaries imposed in the statute, the principles of administrative law, the fundamental values of Canadian society and the Charter. 5)The trial judge dismissed the application with respect to s.30.  6)Each application is a separate matter and should be dealt with according to the broad principles of law applicable to all circumstances. 7)The issues raised by this application are the same. Whether the reasons for the delay such that it would be just to allow the claim to be allowed in spite of the delay, whether the Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption contained in s.40 within its jurisdiction, whether there was any uncertainty as to the cause of death based upon the circumstances leading up to the death, and whether the board","The deceased was a master's student who also worked as a student assistant at the University of Saskatchewan.

"HELD: The court granted the divorce and ordered the child to be registered in the Montessori program. The parties were one year removed from the original decision and the matter would not get to pre-trial. There was no reason for the court to delay the trial. The child was now fully potty trained and would be able to attend school with the respondent. The issues were resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The mere passage of time is not sufficient reason to vary an existing order. The statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of the divorce are present. The matter will not get past a pre- trial conference for several months to decide whether to proceed with the parenting arrangements. As the child is only five days removed from having given birth, matters involving the children and the petitioner's parenting are very much in flux. The court should carefully review the material to determine whether there exists a compelling reason to change an interim order. This is one of those things that arose during the course of an action and following an interim court order being made. There is more than a minor change in circumstances and the threshold test set forth in Guenther has been met. HELD: 1)The child was to be registraded in a MontessorI program. 2)The petitioner was ordered to have the child in the program by the petitioner. 3)The parties were able to transport him to the program. 4)The court was not required to make any determinations on either the creditability of the parties or on any allegations of misrepresentation having been made. The facts of this matter speak for themselves and allow for decisions to be made on the various issues. 5)The applicant was granted access to the courtroom. 6)The children were to have additional time with the petitioner and to have her accompany him to his appointments and activities. 7)The respondent was to have custody and access. 8)The issues of child and parenting were to be decided on the basis of the evidence before the court. 9)The Court was prepared to impose costs on the application.","Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.

In September 1994, the accused's application for release from custody pending the hearing and determination of his appeal was granted by a member of the Court of Appeal. The accused appealed the sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment to 6 months and the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as provided for.

"The wife commenced the divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between herself and the father. The father sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousals. The mother argued that the Separations Agreement was a good agreement and that it should be varied to reflect the true financial circumstances of the parties. The parties agreed to joint custody of the child and to provide the mother with the means to support her family in the area. The husband argued that he expected the agreement to be varied because he believed the agreement would favour the mother and that mobility would become an issue at some point. The evidence showed that the parties had first arrived at an amount of child support which when combined would keep the mother in the jurisdiction. The agreement clearly favoured the mother. The respondent gave up all his interest in the division of matrimonial property (except for his vehicle) in order to keep his child in the home. He agreed to term of spousol support that exceeded what he was prepared to pay. The petitioner failed to negotiate a mobility restriction clause which prevented her from keeping her and her child in their home. The court ordered an increase in access.","The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills.

BCFS, 2003 NSCA 119 (CanLII), which I will hereinafter refer to as BSF. 2)The court had not lost its jurisdictional jurisdiction in this matter and the matter was to continue tomorrow.  2)Reapprehension will expose the child to the very delay the deadlines are designed to avoid since each of the stages set out in the Act (interim hearing, protection finding and at least one disposition hearing) will have to run their course, in the absence of consent to consolidation under s40(2). 3)When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date. There may be need for the preparation of expert reports and other trial preparation and to ascertain whether ongoing further services would have resolved the problem. The court has a fundamental policy of following those guidelines whenever it is possible and of taking whatever exceptional steps are needed to achieve that compliance. 4)Any attempt after the trial to make a continued intervention order of any type would not be possible in the circumstances.","The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.

"The accused was charged with a number of offences, including robbery, and possession of a gun. The police stopped the car and found the accused in it, minutes after the robbery with the person who had pleaded guilty to the robbery and the gun and brass knuckles. At the time of the police stop, the accused was sitting in the car with the other accused. The accused was not at the scene of the robbery, had not been picked up on the way to the court, nor had he provided any evidence about what happened in the house where the robbery took place. HELD: The accused’s involvement in the robbery was ruled out. The circumstantial evidence at this point was piling up and it was logical to infer that the people found in the vehicle when it was stopped by the police were the people who got out of the car when it left Sackville. The court found that the circumstances in the case were more than suspicious given that the accused had a hand gun and was sitting directly in front of the accused and that she did not stop to pick up any of the people she had picked up. There was an opportunity for the accused to demonstrate that he was not involved with the robbery. The Court found that because the accused clearly saw the people he described and was able to identify them, the evidentiary gap could not be closed. The Crown had proven that it had a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed the robbery or if he was the mastermind behind the crime.","The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.",7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery.

"HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully harvesting forest products and found that it should have quashed the sentence. The conviction was upheld on the basis that there was no evidence that could support a finding that the firewood sold to the undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the illegal sale of the wood was not the subject matter of this appeal. The appeal court also appealed the sentence imposed on the appellant for unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The issues on appeal were whether there was evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict and whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the learned trial judge’s conclusion. On the factual grounds, the standard of review is whether there is evidence uponwhich a triering-fact could reasonably be found to support the trial judge. The appellant was found not guilty on the trafficking charge because the evidence did not come directly from the Crown. The Crown appealed the sentencing of the appellant on the issue of unlawfully trafficking. HELD: 1)The appellant was convicted of trafficking forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) and s. 822 of the Criminal Code. 2)He was found guilty of unlawfully selling forest products on Crown lands and unlawfully possessing forest products from private lands. 3)Given that the defendant was entitled to harvest dead wood from Crown land for his personal heating purposes and that he was permitted to harvest wood for his own use, there was an error of law by the lower court in relation to the wood being sold to him. Thus, the appellant court should intervene if the decision is not correct in law unless there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice that has occurred. 4)On appeal, the court may allow a Crown appeal where a conviction for unlawfully harvesting, or on any ground if there was a miscarriageof justice. 5)The evidence of conservation officers was uncontradicted.","The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.",7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act.

"HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that the parties could appeal an arbitrators' decision based on the very limited nature of potential appeals. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements was so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that they cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. 2)The use of the word 'arbitration' in the meaning of s.45(2) of the Act does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that 'it goes without saying', in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. 3)The agreements signed with HAL did not provide for the right of appeal on questions of law. The terms of the agreement set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution, and the parties intentionally 'contracted out' of it.","HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.",8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.

"The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that when the defendant's vehicle passed hers, a piece of metal came off of his vehicle, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet and hit the plaintiff's vehicle. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The defendant engaged two experts to examine the piece of wood and reported that it did not come from the tractor- trailer. The experts concluded that the piece had not flown from the trailer and therefore there was no issue to be tried. The claim was dismissed. The court found that the defendant had met the threshold test of establishing a material fact requiring a trial and that the plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence to support the bare allegation made in the pleadings. There was no genuine issue for trial and the defendant was found to have borne the costs of the discovery.","The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled.

"The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times over top of her clothing, in all cases touching her inappropriately, while she was sleeping or in the presence of her children. The accused was drunk and had been inebriated. The complainant alleged that he touched her buttocks once, her breasts once and sometimes while standing on the couch. She called the police. An expert witness testified that he had been drinking and that he was drunk. HELD: Accused found guilty. 1)There was no reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Although he did not have a reasonable chance of being found guilty on all of the allegations, there was some circumstantial evidence surrounding his guilty plea. There was no evidence beyond that which would have confirmed his guilt. 2)The evidence was not so reasonable as to justify a guilty verdict. The Crown had all the evidence they needed to convict the accused of dangerous behaviour. The Court was unable to conclude that his explanation for his behaviour was beyond reasonable doubt and beyond the reasonable doubt of his reasonable doubt on all the other allegations.",The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor.

"The parties divorced in 1992 and the appellant was ordered to pay $200 monthly support. He later entered a new relationship and he and his common-law spouse had a mentally handicapped child born in 1995. He remained at home to care for the child, while his common law spouse died suddenly in 1997. He used his commonlaw spouse's modest insurance proceeds for living expenses and he made no payment towards the accumulated arrears of support. In March, 2000, he made an application to vary the support order both by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing the arrear. The application was dismissed without reasons. He appealed the resulting order. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court ordered the payment of $30 a month to Maintenance Enforcement. The arrearns were not likely to ever be paid in full and the reduced amount was reduced to $5,000.

"This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father felt that since he was paying a proportionally greater share of the day to day care expenses, the mother would have no reason to develop a better relationship with him. The evidence from the father's witnesses differed materially from that given by the mother. HELD: Custody and access were granted to the father with a review date. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses was credible and the information concerning the mother's contributions to the children's education was not. The court found that although the mother had not always been as respectful of the father during the marriage, she had not convinced me that the set-off amount was inappropriate given the childrens needs when living in her household. 1) The evidence indicated that the father would not seek to renegotiate the arrangement or change the way the children were cared for. 2) There was no evidence that the parties would suffer irreparable harm if a shared arrangement were entered into. 3) The father was to pay $502 per month for child care and Taekwondo expenses. Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines was considered and the set off was appropriate. 4) The mother was to receive a setoff amount of $502.5 per month. The formula used in this decision was based on the best interests of the parties and could not be taken as an excuse for deterioration in his communication and behaviour. Spousal support was not included in the calculation of child support table. 5) The information was credible. 6) There were no significant differences between the parties.","The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount.

"The appellant was convicted of seven offences, including careless use of a firearm, pointing a firearm at a person, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public, possessionof a weapon at an unauthorized place (Criminal Code s. 86(1), 88(1)) and 95(1) offences.

"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application.

Rather than inventing structured procedures for Charter applications in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. 2)There will be instances where defence counsel will be given some leeway at some stage of the trial to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial. Counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue and at trial, counsel should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion is made.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.",b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application.

"The respondent father applied to vary an order made in May 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his father's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. When she returned in August 2006, Michael began living with his mother. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. Michael resumed living with the mother and was supported by his grandmother. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another, notwithstanding the difficulty it undoubtedly causes their children. 2)The onus is on the parent wishing to invoke the operation of s to demonstrate to the court's satisfaction that a shared custody arrangement as contemplated by s. is in place and has been in place over the course of year. While it is necessary that there be a shared parenting regime in place, it is not necessary that the parties live together for the foreseeable future. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9. Accordingly, the father did not meet it. 3)A trial of s. 7 would be necessary to determine the appropriate amount to be paid by the father each month to cover s. expenses. 4)The mother was entitled to costs in the amount of $500.","The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991.

Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years.

"A summary conviction appeal from a judgment wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds of appeal were that the learned trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely, that the appellant had been drinking, that he had bloodshot red eyes, his mouth appeared to be dry, he was rubbing his lips and he smacked his lips even when he was not talking and that, having worked with the appellant in the past, he had not been informed of his right to counsel when the tests were performed; and that observations concerning slurred speech while the appellant was detained and prior to being permitted to drive constituted an unsafe and/or dangerous verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The learned judge made express findings of credibility concerning the evidence of the two police officers who testified at the scene as to the appellant's level of intoxication. The learned judge did not resort to conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 2)Although the results of roadside sobriety tests are not an admissible evidence at trial as evidence of impairment, there is no inherent improbability in the observations concerning the impairment of the accused. The observations were corroborative of other symptoms of impairment that were noted by the police officers. 3)The appellant could say with his limited exposure that the accused had alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes, flushed face, and his speech was lacking in any detail and he was as well smacking his lips. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the trial judge.","The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.",e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations.

"Electric Limited (the defendant) applied for an order permitting the defendant to amend his admissions and add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act and for leave to apply for the amendment to the admissions. The defendant had previously been a director of the defendant and had filed a defence and counterclaim against the defendants. Oickle had left the company in early 2003 and was no longer working for the defendant. The defendants sued him in early 2004. The plaintiff alleged that Oickle surreptitiously competed against the company during his employment, appropriated opportunities that would have been available to the company, and misused company resources to support his competition. Okeller and his new counsel applied for orders permitting the defence to withdraw the admissions and for an application for an “oppression remedies” pursuant to the Companies act. The appellants sought leave to appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence on which the defendant's rights as existing shareholder were suspended by the consent order and not his rights as a former shareholder. The judge misinterpreted the effect of the April 2004 consent order referred to in the statement of claim. There must be some parameters within which the concepts of 'former shareholder andformer director' confined to the concepts outlined in the terms of the Shareholder Agreement. The new counsel could reasonably be drawn by requiring some connection between the timing of the events which are the subject matter of the proposed derivative action and the position of the applicant as shareholder or director.","The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company.

The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies.

"This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s.9 Charter motions and lead evidence.

Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of a breathalyzer law, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss.8 and s9 charter motions and leads evidence to the contrary, the court found that prejudice can be inferred on the basis that the length of delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed.","The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time.

"The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the Gold Key Lease has none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Issues #2 and #3 were whether the lease agreement was actually a rental contract pursuant to s.62 of the Act, and whether Chrysler was vicarious liable for any negligence attributed to Giffin. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in finding that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case. The reverse onus provision simply does not apply.  2) The complex legal issues arose out of disputed facts and the appropriate inferences and legal consequences to be drawn from them were found.  3) The relationship between the law of vicarious liability and the automobile and its owner was unambiguously determined by the precedents.  4) The lease agreement did not fit within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62. 5) The insurer was not a party to the motion or on this appeal.  6) In a non-employer/employee relationship, the court reviewed Bazley v.

The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.",7_2010nsca95.txt,"The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence.

"The accused was charged with two counts of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and one count of attempting to strike his estranged wife with a motor vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court found the accused guilty of both counts. 1)The Court found that the accused operated the motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and the Crown had proven the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the counts. The offence required a marked departure from prudent conduct. The evidence showed that both the accused and the wife had been drinking and smoking pot at the time of the assault. The accused admitted to hitting the wife and driving the truck dangerously close to the ground while she was laying on the ground. 2)The injuries to the wife were accidental and the bruises sustained by the accused were the result of intervening events. 3)The Criminal Code does not provide an excuse to lie about the nature of the offence or to act in a dangerous manner. On the evidence, the Crown has proven the guilty of the accused to the satisfaction of a reasonable person with respect to the count of assisting in the commission of an offence of this nature. 4)There was no evidence of a consensual fight between the parties. There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the victim. The circumstantial evidence raised the issue of whether the accused was in a place where he might reasonably believe he was contributing to the dangerous driving condition of the general public.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code; assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Code; dangerous driving contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Code; and two counts of assault contrary to s. 266(a) of the Code. HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct.

"The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. HELD: The application was granted and the stay was lifted in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of the Children's Law Act. The reasons for the decision were: 1) the mother's lack of involvement in the child's life was due more to concern that the father would be held responsible for an injustice than any other factor; and 2) the father had not bothered to have any involvement with the child from the time he was an infant until he was again contacted by the mother. The father's seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and his sister especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. The court lifted the stay in proceedings arising pursuant to Rule 15(4).","The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.",9_2013skca85.txt,The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212).

"This was an application for an order varying the judgment of Dickson J. of the 5th of January 1990 in which he gave judgment for divorce and joint custody to the parents of two boys born April 22, 1984 and June 3, 1986. The mother had filed an application to vary the judgment by granting sole custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The circumstances were that the mother had been the primary care giver, principal residence being with her in the school term and the father in the summer term and he was to have generous access. 2)The economic situation in the province was such that a change in the circumstances would be in the best interests of the children if the joint custody order were not made. 3)The mother's application was not made to thwart the father's access but rather to have him removed from the province. 4)The father was entitled to reasonable and prompt access.","The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years. Under the existing order the children's primary residence was with their Father.

HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.",c_1995canlii5671.txt,"The Mother applied to vary the custody provisions of the decree nisis for divorce which provided for joint custody of the parties' 2 children, aged 11 and 9 years.

"Rule 173(c) of The Class Actions Act requires leave to appeal from a Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(C) application. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act and Rule 49 of the Court of Court of Appeals Rules for an order granting them leave to appealed from the chambers judge's certification order and the dismissal of the Rule173(c). They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Anns test, which states that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those akin to those before him. They also argued that evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause.  1)Nothing in the Chamber judge's reasons suggested he applied the Ann's test or applied the Re: Collections Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 and were well known to counsel. 2)The Chambers judge made no errors in law. The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer might owe a fee of service to a client and the evidence of the Respondent lawyer, Gary Davies, establish a common issue that appears to meet the commonality requirements of the class actions Act.  3)The issues raised by the applicants were not the only issues to be considered in the application. 4)The common issue was not one of relevance to the trial or to the cause but rather a commonality issue.  5)No appeal was granted for breach of s. 6(1)(c) or s. 7(d) of the Act. 6)Leave was granted or withheld in consideration of merit and importance as follows: 1)The proposed appeal would be prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant the attention of this Court.  6)The Court of appeal would not require an analysis by the Province of the common law or the interpretation of applicable law in the circumstances. 7)The arguments advanced by the parties in their submissions were not of relevance in the context of the case law or to any of the other issues before the Court. 8)The facts, combined with","The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence.

"FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for child support purposes is $59,500 gross per annum. In December 2002, Justice Dickson terminated the respondent's obligation to pay support for the parties' oldest child, Corry. In September 2004, Justice Wilkinson of this Court granted a consent order extending the respondent’s s.7 expenses. The respondent accepted responsibility for their costs. In addition, he agreed to pay his proportionate share of the girls’ dental and orthodontic expenses.  2) In September 2005, a number of orders were made varying the amount of child support. In October 2005, Justice R. S. Smith terminated Mr. Alm”s obligation for support effective October 1, 2005.

The petitioner also sought to have the respondent pay his portion of the costs for crisis prevention classes, computer repairs and equipment and support disallowed.

The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for the issuance of the warrant. HELD: The application was granted and the evidence obtained by it was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on a 'tip' originating from outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, the evidence corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. The police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources.","The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid.

At issue was the issue of whether the accused should be charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle and ammunition, in a careless manner, or joint possession with the accused. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. 1) The accused had not obtained a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor had he obtained a valid registration certificate for the firearms seized. 2) The essential issue on the firearms possession charges was whether the evidence led by the Crown had established that the respondent had constructive possession of two guns and ammunition at the address of his father. 3) The evidence introduced as evidence by the defence in relation to the guns was not the ones located in the respondent’d home. The evidence was that of the Crown witnesses. The witnesses did not cross-examine the lead exhibit officer for Operation Intrude. 4) The testimony of the accused and the documentary exhibits entered through or referred to by them left no doubt about the continuity and integrity of the exhibits. The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the case and never shifts to the accused, and an assessment that an accused is probably guilty is insufficient. Reasonable doubt is the whole of the evidence that must be assessed in the determination of the facts and evidence of the case. 5) The Court was unable to accept that the guilty pleas of the respondent and the stepmother were relevant because they did not associate him with the phone and entitles him at trial to demand the Crown prove the phone is his.","The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.",c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

"FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considered the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320 versus $56,103.00 for the respondent’s income and determined that the economic hardship the petitioner was experiencing was $10,000/month. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to pay retroactive monthly support of $700.00 to the petitioner in the amount of $8,540.00 per month beginning November 1, 2013 and on the first day of each month thereafter until further order of the court. The petitioner was awarded costs of $1,200.00 payable by the respondent.  2)The court reviewed the SAGEG as a guide only and found that retroactive support preceding commencement of the proceedings ought not to be granted in an application for interim support. The court found that assuming the circumstances in which the petitioner had taken this action changed materially in the past 3 years leading up to this action, the respondent should be given effective notice that she was now seeking additional support. 3)The petitioner did not seek to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income based upon significant overtime income.","Family Law – Spousal Support – RetroactiveThe petitioner commenced a family law proceeding requesting divorce and equal division of family property in 2010.

FIAT. The petitioner sought interim custody of his only child born in 1996. Section of the Divorce Act requires either spouse to be ordinarily resident in the province for at least 1 year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. HELD: Interim custody was granted to the father. 1)The child had no connection of consequence to Alberta and the Court lacked jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction under the Children's Law Act. 2)The father had consented to or acquiesced in the child residing in Saskatchewan and the court had jurisdiction pursuant to s.15(1)(b) as the childclearly had a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta. 3)The court found jurisdiction under ss.15 and 1(3)as the child had a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it was appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. As a result the court has jurisdiction under s. 15(1(b). 4)In the event that there was a change in the petitioner's residence the matter was brought back before the Court for review.

"The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. He was also charged with impaired driving. Witnesses testified that the defendant lost control of his vehicle as he rounded a curve at the top of a hill near the fire Hall. The defendant was the lone occupant. Witnesses gave evidence of him getting gas at the fire hall, before leaving the scene. He claimed to have had three beers in the car, but later admitted to having only had three. He stated that he only consumed three beers at the time of the accident, and that he also informed someone that someone had let him know that he was either high or intoxicated.

"The applicant applied for an order that the respondents be prohibited from further proceedings or actions in relation to a formal complaint against him, dated December 15, 1988, alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming a barrister and solicitor. The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for a stay of proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal. This stay was granted in 1995 and the Hearing Committee met intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time for firstly because the court had imposed a stay and then because the criminal matters were still before the court. The applicant appealed his conviction and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. He appealed the conviction and sought leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave was denied on May 22, 1997. The last two sentences in the third paragraph on p.3 of the judgment should be deleted as they may enable him to escape upon a technicality. The sentence of the applicant's sentencing was set aside in August 1995.

"The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred between April 8 and April 14, 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases. The first proposed basis is to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences but not the others. There is no such risk of propensity reasoning in a judge alone mode of trial and the court will not countenance otherwise. The second application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. It is the absence of a true nexus between the counts; the complexity of the evidence and the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; and the potential of the accused deciding to testify on one set of counts (i.e., those pertaining to April 8/14) could be more efficient and cost effective to have all the counts tried together and thereby be avoided while the accused is in custody. The Court has had the benefit of watching a two hour videotaped interview conducted by the police in the early morning hours of April 15, 2010. In that interview, the accused adamantly disclaimed any association with the subject handgun whatsoever. He maintains that the gun was not his and that he had nothing to do with its possession or use either on April 8 or on April 14th. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. The Crown has in the wings a ballistics report containing expert opinion evidence that match has been made between the gun used in the April 8th shooting and that found by the arresting police officers on April 13th. This finding can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests of justice require a joint trial.","The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.",2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed.

The sellers were not represented by legal counsel. They prepared a transfer of the property and sent it to the Land Tittles Office for registration. On August 20, 1997 a mortgage was registered by the lawyer on the title without the words 'as joint tenants' appearing on it. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did and that the mistake was not noticed by him when he reviewed the documents.

Rochon had been satisfied on the facts of this case and the applicant had an alternate remedy available which would correct the mistake and provide compensation to the lawyer for any loss suffered as a result of the mistake. 3)The authorities had narrowly construed the discretion to amend or alter or cancel registrations.

"The parties were involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The parties lived in Alberta and then Nova Scotia. At the outset of this relationship, the Agency sought to have its involvement terminated, while L.M. sought the continued intervention of the Agency. The Agency consented to its continued involvement with the child, who had run from her mother's home and stayed with her paternal uncle in [...]. The Agency applied for a protection order from Nova Scotia which required the children to be placed in the custody of T.B.'s common law partner, who was to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children who had been apprehended by the Agency and who became the guardian and foster parent of the children, respectively. The protection order was dismissed in February 2006. The children were placed with their father, who lived in a supervised care home with his sister, who in turn remained with the mother until her death in December 2005. The father did not participate at the disposition review, although he participated in previous hearings. HELD: The court found that the information concerning B.R.W. was simply not germane to the agency's decision. It would appear that the Agency was responding appropriately to the children's current situation. The court ordered the supervision order to be dismissed as the Agency had failed to take proper steps to protect the children. The provisions of the Children and Family Services Act provide that no person shall publish or make public information that has the effect of identifying a child who is a witness at or participant in a hearing or the subject of proceeding pursuant to the Act, or parent or guardian, foster parent or relative of the child.","Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect.

"The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. 2) The accused's version of the incident in the general office differed significantly from that of the complainant. The accused responded to an invitation from the police to attend at the police station. He said he believed that the matter was closed and that he would return his call. She was required to specifically describe a number of incidents that took place over a period of about year and then year after the last of the incidents had taken place and believed her recollection was accurate. She believed that he was only joking and that there was never any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. The statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness. It was necessary that certain findings of credibility be made in this case.  3) While there is some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21, the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003.","The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.",e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature.

"Applicant asks for an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. The application is opposed by the Attorney General of Canada. HELD: 1) The applicant has and will continue to experience financial difficulty to such an extent that (he) will be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan. The debt in effect can either be cancelled or affirmed.  2) Using the Superintendent's Standards he may have a monthly surplus of about $170. It would take many years for him to contribute enough to significantly reduce this liability.  3) He does not have the resources to discharge this liability now, nor in the next several years.","The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.

"The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The father, who was a pediatrician, claimed that the mother, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, had wrongfully accused him of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: 1)The mother's justification plea was withdrawn.  2)The children had been receiving a report from the pediatrician in support of an order for home study. The report was prepared for use in family court custody proceedings and their maker was protected by law from being sued. 3)The evidence showed that the alleged abusers had been using the children's reports to attack and threaten the mother's credibility. 4)The facts were set out in a detailed report prepared by the mother. The evidence showed the alleged abuses were not credible and the report was grossly defamatory. 5)The conduct of the parents was characterised by hostility, accusations, intimidation and duress. 6)The statements of the alleged victims were found to be defamatories of the Declaration of Rights. 7)The court was not prepared to accept the mother’s admission that she had written the reports in the hope of obtaining custody for the children and that the evidence supported her allegations. 8)The defendant was found to have acted in good faith in the report and in good conscience in the execution of his duties. 9)The plaintiff was ordered to pay $600 costs to the defendant. 10)The co-defendants were ordered to forfeit any profits or assets they might have in the cause. 11)The plaintiffs were ordered not to contact the children even if they had been sued. 12)The parties agreed to a six month wait in order to have the report published. The co- defendants were ordered by the court to have their counsel assessed and then to pay the plaintiff’ s costs. 12"")The court found that the statements of fact were defamative and that they constituted malice. 13)The fact that the defendant was the mother who prepared the report did not serve to justify the six month delay. The plaintiff was entitled to judgment for breach of contract and breach of undertaking.","Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages.

"The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being held in Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and a half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff also submits that the airline and its employees did not take proper precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays on board the plane. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim does not disclose a cause of action.  2) Pursuant to s. 4(2)(a), the Act provides for an order certifying an action as a class action is not a determination of the merits of the action. 3) The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no action. All allegations of fact pleaded are to be accepted as true and secondly, pleadings will only be struck if it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs cannot succeed. 4) The generous approach to be adopted on this application is to set out the principles of class certification and the applicable statute and regulations. 5) Although the plaintiff was given until March 2006 to file case law with regard to the narrow issue of the meaning of 'bodily injury' within the Montreal Convention, it is not very high onus on the plaintiffs to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of actions. Although the Court would have dismissed the certification request on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria as outlined in the Act, for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, it would have also dismissed the certifying application on its basis of the other criteria as listed in the act not being met for reasons which will be briefly outlined in that judgment. 6) Corrigendum released July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina.

"FIAT: The Court ordered a number of orders regarding child support and an order regarding summer access. The remaining issues were: what, if any, should the father pay to the mother for extraordinary expenses relating to tutoring for one or both children; what, pursuant to s. 7(1)(d) of the Divorce Act, the interim spousal support order; what retroactive support should be payable by the father to the Mother; what if any retroactive spousals should be ordered in this matter; interim spOUSAL support; interim childcare costs; interim costs. HELD: 1) The Court was unable to make a retroactive child support order because the father did not have necessary resources to pay monthly sum to the wife once he had satisfied his child support obligations. At this interim stage, the matter should not affect the right of the mother to pursue spousa support in the future. Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence discloses that both children, but more particularly Kody, was in need of a specialized educational program given his current problems at school. Although it is clear from the evidence that the mother has an entitlement to interim spouse support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 2) The Sylvan Learning Centre expenses were necessary and reasonable. The father's share of both childcare costs and the Sylvan learning centre expense was equal to 71% of the total cost. 3) The mother was ordered to pay costs in the sum of $400 to the father pursuant to S. 15.3(1) of The DivorceAct.","FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses. HELD: 1) The father is not opposed to Kody receiving some additional educational assistance. However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month. Although the father will be stretched, the Sylvan program is necessary and reasonable.  2) Although the mother has an entitlement to spousal support, the father does not have the ability to pay. 3) The father shall pay costs in the sum of $400.",d_2007skqb266.txt,"FIAT: The primary issue is whether the father should pay for tutoring expenses.

"The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act is also not within the Act. 2) While the insured clients' class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involve the interests of other persons. 3) While there has been some disagreement as to the appropriate manner of payment, it is clearly arguable that to the extent Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, it had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; 4) While some of the borrowers may have defaulted in payment of loan obligations and/or related insurance premiums and Ag Credit may have chosen to nonetheless pay the premiums on their behalf, this economic reality needs to be recognized. 5) The applicant has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim by the insurer that the surplus is its property.  6) Empire Life will be appointing a representative party to advance the case and interests of the insureds class.","Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus.

"The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1 year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to properly consider the test for a defence of necessity. His belief in the existence of photographs enhanced the complainant's credibility. There was some evidence that could amount to an error of fact but no miscarriage of justice resulted. 2)The court found that the trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist or by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction could not be set aside for that error of law alone.  3)Although correctly articulating the test used in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the court was unable to conclude that his belief in that the appellant's evidence had influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 4)It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for the conviction and an order to be made in s. 686 are granted.","The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant.

"The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed an issue on whether it was liable to the plaintiff for injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same if not identical to those considered by the Court in the Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 2)The evidence did not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the fall. The logs showed that floors in the produce department were swept a total of 16 times between 9:00 a.m. and 9:20 p.m., each cleaning by dry or wet mop. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. On the basis of all of the evidence, the plaintiff met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the Floor of the Store. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 4)The affidavits filed by the store's owner and occupier as required by the simplified procedure were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. 5)Although the defendant did not know the water was there, it did know that water and other substances could be in the store and who would be assumed to be willing to assist that party. The evidence does not support either the occupier's or defendant's use of reasonable care to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger' and if he did not, was the invitee contributorily negligent.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases.

The respondent pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her 7-month-old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded her 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of three grounds: 1) the sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to both the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it; 2) the trial judge erred by failing to give appropriate weight to the aggravating features of the case and by overemphasizing the significance of the factors he found to be mitigating; and 3) the respondent had a dysfunctional upbringing which resulted in symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Court found these factors were factors which should be considered in assessing the appropriate sentence for the respondent. These particular issues were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court.,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.",4_2009skca102.txt,"The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances."
"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s. 151 and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety had refused to sign the document, stating that after it had been filled out by the justice of peace it was handed to him and he was told to sign it, the document was not explained to him, nor were the potential consequences of the breaches explained. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizee. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact. The principles of the Criminal Code were not to punish an obligor but to enforce payment of a financial obligation. The ability to pay surety was a factor to be considered but, in the circumstances, the accused was experiencing enough negative factors to conclude that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.  2) It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture against the accused for his failure to appear for trial which is not acceptable in our system of criminal justice.  3) Although the accused may be prone to blameworthy or reckless, if one accepts his version and deserves some sanction, the circumstances have concluded that he should be responsible for the forfeiture of the bail.","The accused was charged with four offences relating to a twelve year old girl, including sexual assault and uttering a threat. He was released on bail with a surety. The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited.

Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment.

"The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 was a result of a resolution to expropriate the land for widening the Bedford Highway. The land was originally intended to be used as a retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 and was completed in June 1994. In October 1994, the City Council abandoned the expropriated land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the appellant appealed the decision, which the City held was an error. Allowing the appeal and the taxation of costs, that the errors by the Taxing Master were minor and not indicative of the overall position of the appellant. The appellant's solicitor-client account was taxed by Arthur Hare and in a decision in August 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The TaxingMaster was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant solicitor. This amounts to $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file.","The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed.

"The appellant was charged with impaired driving and driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol or drug. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the breathalyzer demand. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed; the findings of the trial judge do not address fully the various indicia of impaired driving beyond the findings that the accused had been drinking, had a very slight accident and failed the SL-2. It was, however, open to him as well on the evidence before him to consider that the appellant (a) had bloodshot eyes and (b) had a moderate smell of alcohol on him. He had apparently concluded that in the event he had failed the screening device he was capable of continuing to drive.","The police observed the appellant's vehicle rub another vehicle and followed him to where he parked without difficulty. While taking the appellant to where the incident occurred, the officer noted slight smell of alcohol and bloodshot eyes. The appellant failed the ALERT test and refused the breathalyzer.

"This was an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The plaintiff was stopped on the Cole Harbour Road by a flagman to allow a piece of heavy machinery to back out onto the road.

The injuries were aggravated by the motor vehicle crash. The defendant admitted liability and was liable for 33.33 percent of this sum. The total award was $70,305.12 plus pre-judgment interest of 2.5% per annum. For the lower back injury, the plaintiff was entitled to an award in the amount of $75,000. Not all of the damages were attributable to the defendant's negligence. The whiplash injury to her neck was assessed at $34,251.88. The court awarded $25,000 for loss of income and added $5,500 for section B benefits.

"The landlord appealed a decision of the hearing officer of the Residential Tenancies Office. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and made an error in law by failing to make an order for possession of the rental unit. The landlord appealed. Appeal dismissed; in these circumstances there was no valid tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant and the Hearing Officer did not err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. To create a fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the tenant must enter a written tenancy agreement. The Hearing Officer found that although the tenant had signed a 3-year lease in good faith, it was under the express or implied consent of the landlord that it be concluded that the landlord had not obtained the necessary security deposit and interest from the tenant and until such time the tenant may have remedies against the landlord.","The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.

In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person.

The plaintiffs claim against Ford for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford. The action against Country Plaza was discontinued. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs have proven beyond a balance of probabilities that the fire started as an electric static discharge through the U-shaped fuel tube in the Ford truck. Due to extreme cold weather the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the accumulated static electricity discharged through the fuel line would flare up and into the adjacent garage where the gasoline was pooled. 2)There are no known reports of this type of fire occurring in the United States. 3)The Court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and in preference the judge from the Provincial Fire Commissioner's Office with respect to the cause and origin of the fire.,"The Plaintiff's 1989 Ford F150 1/2 ton truck caught fire and burned in his garage.

"The respondent owned several buildings converted into apartment units. The respondent repainted the buildings haphazard and multi-coloured. They were an eye-sore. Following complaints from nearby property owners, the respondent was charged with 'owning unsightly properties' contrary to the provisions of the Halifax City Charter. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge made no error in law.

Unsightly in that subsection cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings because this category is already dealt with in s.6.

"The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant argues that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge misapprehended evidence. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on errors of fact and not on proper interpretation of evidence. 3) There is no other way in which the appellant’s evidence could be viewed as internally inconsistent. The trial judge attempted to portray himself as someone who was good to the children but failed to give proper effect to it. The evidence that the appellant asked not to be left alone with the children was not evidence of the truth of the allegations. The inference drawn by this evidence was material and played an essential part in the decision to convict.  4) In the circumstances of this case, either use reveals a chain of reasoning which is not available to the judge in law or in logic on this record and the court concludes that the errors were not sufficient to justify the denial of evidence on this point.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault.

The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice."
"This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position as a senior geophysicist. The position was based on a contract between the parties that required the plaintiff to give 30 days notice of termination if the company desired to terminate the contract. The defendant refused, and the plaintiff went into deep depression. He underwent treatment for several years and then quit work. He claimed that he could leave the company on three months notice. He alleged that this clause did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant but rather to a period of time when the contract would terminate. Awarding the plaintiff $500.00 in salary and benefits, that the 30 day notice provision in the contract did not abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given.","In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice.

The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta.

The actual amount of the expenses may be somewhat more or somewhat less than the actual amount.

The roles of the parties and the validity of their agreement was clearly disputed. 2) The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently exist. The respondent is not obliged to pursue work in the field of computer consultant or to impute income. 3) The respondent's gross income is $53,000.

It is only in the circumstances that the parties have relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis that that agreement is unfair and unconscionable. 4) In this case, the petitioner was granted child support pursuant to the agreement.

"The applicant sought to vary spousal support in accordance with the terms of their Corollary Relief Judgment. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child, who was now independent of the parties. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and the parties divorced in February 2003. At the time of the divorce, the respondent brought an application to vary the respondent's monthly spousals to reflect the changes in the applicant's debt situation. The applicant argued that the Agreement reached in January 2003 did not conform with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed. She proposed that the monthly support be increased to a figure that closely resembles that of the respondent or, $21,864.00 exclusive of those support payments. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The agreement was sound when signed and there were no changes in circumstances. The objective of the Agreement was to provide for an approximately equal division of matrimonium assets and debts. 2)The respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. 3)The Agreement was not unconscionable. The Agreement was based on the principles of mutual desire and took heed to all of the objectives in Miglin (supra). 4)There had been a change in circumstances since the signing of the agreement and the applicant had not met that burden. 5)The applicant was found to have been in debt.  6)The parties had signed an agreement in 2004 which incorporated the terms and provisions of Miglin. Miglin does not permit substitutions for goods and services or for loans or to take out loans. There is no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature.

The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge oughtto have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court.

"The plaintiffs constructed their case in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings. The plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City but were part of the general contract with respect to the use of truckers. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 21, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work and the contract Between the City and TripleP Holdings obligates the plaintiffs to provide services according to the maximum allotment of hours available. The issue of privity could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case would not turn on the question of privities. The plaintiff were not actually parties to either contract but were involved in the general arrangement and certain benefits intended to pass through the general contracting to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The evidence was that the defendant made some efforts to include them in the rotational rotation. HELD: Each case was dismissed. The single issue of access was overwhelmed by the larger issue as to what really is the contract alleged to have been breached. The case would therefore focus on the privity of contract rather than on the issue of entitlement.","This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants.

The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P.

While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.

Much of that would be irrelevant. 7)All agreements between the two defendants as they relate to the franchises and their dealings with other persons who were potential operators in the Prince Albert area or who actually became such operators were privileged and therefore admissible evidence. 8)Each party had brought an application and had been successful at least in part. The broad relevance as opposed to a narrow or strict relevance is the applicable test. 9)Any costs awarded would be off-setting. 10)The affidavit evidence was not relevant because the plaintiffs filed a defence and counterclaim and there was no requirement that the defendants reply to it. 11)The letter was not privileged as it contained a description of shortfalls and deficiencies. 12)The plaintiffs merely plead 'failing to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation'. The words'shortfalls and deficiencies' did not add much more.

"The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court Judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 25, 2006 and August 26, 2007. The Crown alleged that the judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, apply the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (limited cognitive capacity) is a valid and effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. However, it is not required that the accused be able to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations. The trial judge adopted the higher threshold 'analytic capacity' test for determining the accused's fitness to stand a trial. This test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled.","The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.",6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial.

"FIAT. On January 24, 2002, this matter was heard in chambers and I reserved on the issue of whether costs should be assessed against the plaintiffs over the conduct of their counsel or against counsel directly at this time. HELD: The matter was to be determined by the trial judge in the course of the action. 1) Because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the three applications, the applications were dismissed. There was a request by the defendants' counsel to have the matter addressed by way of costs.  2) Given the plaintiff's representation as to the amount of stress that he was presently under, it was not appropriate in the circumstances to assess costs against them over-the-conduct of their Counsel or against direct counsel at the time. Accordingly, the matter was left to the trial court in the matter of this action. 3) The two motions served by the plaintiffs on the defendants returnable for January 24/02 were not filed at the Court House prior to the return date as required by The Queen's Bench Rules; and in his confusion he had filed some and not filed others. Given that the plaintiff was under extreme pressure and stress lately, he had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another but in his confused state of mind he had not filed them all.","FIAT.

"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. The appellant argued that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in his charge. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed.  1) The trial judge was of the opinion that counsel for the defence had done most adequately and that it was neither necessary nor desirable that he should repeat the outline of those discrepancies. The evidence of the Crown was that the appellant's cross-examination of the complainant would not have served any useful purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from their efficient discharge of their sworn duty. 2) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The charge was found to be consistent with R. v. Jacquard.  3) The appellant's point of view was that if the sentence of two years or more was imposed, the appellant would have had no appeal against the order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. 4) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. While there is a general obligation on the court to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence, this case met that standard. If a sentence of 2 years less a day is imposed, Mr. Almajidi will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order.","The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order.

"The 37 year old male was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for sexual purposes with his hand contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code and 1 year probation with an order requiring him to participate in an approved program or programs for substance abuse and sex offenders. He was ordered to provide sufficient samples of his bodily substances so that a DNA analysis could be conducted. The Crown requested a sentence of two years less day of imprisonment in addition to the s. 490.012 of the Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public places as provided for by s. 161 of the code. The accused's s. 718.01(ii.1) applies since this case did involve the abuse of a person under the ages of 18 years. The Court requested an order be made in s. 487.012, s.487.012 relating to the imposition of conditional sentences. HELD: The Court found that the sentence imposed for the offence was consistent with s.109 of the criminal code and was appropriate. The provisions of s.810 and s.687 of the Criminal Code relating to denunciation and deterrence were not available in this case. S.718.2(ii) applies as a relevant aggravating circumstance as is the fact that the accused abused his position of trust and authority, namely his step-father/daughter relationship, and this is an aggravating condition that the Court is mandated by s.(a) to consider.","The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A.

"All parties agree that this case turns on the interpretation of article XIV, subsection 14.01 of the joint venture agreement, which provides that the parties are absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or disposing of any interest other than all or part of its Participating Interest. The voting agreement secured the follow up steps under the original commitment by Kensington which would be implemented over a lengthy period of time.

In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

"The father applied for access to his four children at the request of the mother. The mother had previously refused to allow the father to have contact with his children. The father alleged that the mother had deliberately failed to provide the children with information about their medical condition, their use of marijuana, and their driving habits. Application to have the access restricted by the terms of the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment dismissed; the evidence showed that the father was able to drive safely on routes that permitted speeds over 80 km/h. Although the children had expressed some concern about the father's medical condition and its effect on his driving, the father argued that his condition did not hinder his ability to drive. He requested that all restrictions on his transport of the children be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior to his driving. He argued these were reasonable concerns and asked that the restrictions be lifted because his children would not be able to travel within two hours of consuming marijuana. Counsel for the father confirmed that he had renewed his prescription to use marijuana and that he was not seeking to alienate his children from him. Application for a cost award granted for the application not to protect the children's independence but to place the entire responsibility for monitoring their safety on their young shoulders.","The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation.

It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring equipment at the company that led to the equipment being disabled. Either way, the plaintiff has proven that the defendant breached the contract by failing to monitor the temperature in the freezer and by not responding to the restaurant. There is not in the view proof to that standard that the reason Gardon did not received a freezer temperature alarm from Sturgias Meats was within their control. Based on the original contract between the parties and ongoing payments being made in 2010, the court was satisfied that the contract between them was solely for the monitoring of the temperatures in the cooler and freezer and did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at that business. HELD: There was insufficient evidence to prove that the breach of the contract was caused by a computer glitch or by someone at the restaurant or that the equipment was adjusted improperly by someone else. The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the failure of the equipment could have been the cause of the loss of the plaintiff's claim. The court found that an employee of the defendant's monitoring company was monitoring the signal on the dates in question and that no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, when the computer monitoring system was working properly. Given the exclusion clause in the contract which am satisfied is enforceable, the issue becomes whether there was cause beyond Gardon's control which resulted in the failure or in an error by the defendant so it could be reported to the plaintiff.","The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the installation and monitoring of temperature monitoring equipment for its meat cutting business.

"FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. The petitioner is disabled and the respondent is a pediatrician. HELD: 1) The respondent's application to reduce or eliminate child support is dismissed.  1) It is common for a payor to stop recording ongoing child support payments once the children have turned 18. The fact remains that the respondent, who is a medical doctor, has not been paying support for the past 12 years. Rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. The Court does not accept the assertion that he is incapable of paying. It has determined that his child support obligations are based on his actual income over the years. 2) The father will have a few lean years to pay off the arrear. He did not have the ability to pay the support willingly it had to be snatched away from him. 3) The petitioner has always been a child of the marriage. She has always believed in the principles of self sufficiency and in the absence of any special circumstance, the respondent has failed to do so. The court cannot find that the father does not have that ability. 4) The Court reviewed the various orders issued in respect to the child support payable in respect of the 1998 and 2001 orders. The 1998 order was varied and therefore his childsupport obligations were still calculated on an income of $109,912. 5) The 2001 order was inconsistently varied. The s. Guideline amount for this period was $1,493 per month for a total of $107,496 ($1,687 72). The s.(e)of the 3 orders, the Court found that it would be unfair to the respondent to deprive the petitioner of her child support obligation when she is nearing the end of her useful life. 6) Applying the criteria set out in Wurmlinger and D.B.S., the Court concluded that the petitioner had the ability and obligation under the 1998 order to pay child support ended even though the respondent did not record it on its statement. 7) The court found that the child remains a Child of the Marriage until age 59. The arrearns accumulated over the span of 12 years are approximately $183,746. The respondent cannot be faulted for his choice to","The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.",e_2013skqb264.txt,"In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001.

"The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the sender did not take the content of the email as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant contended the evidence presented by the Crown was rife with hearsay and prejudicial to the appellant's credibility. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The evidence raised serious issues of admissibility of evidence, appropriateness of questions asked of the appellant in cross-examination, the impact these matters may have on the integrity and fairness of the trial, the elements of the offence that the Crown needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, and was there sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed and acting reasonably, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on those elements. 2)The trial judge did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence. He simply directed: “Well, we’ll hear what his evidence is, okay and then you can ask him questions.”  3)The only reasonable inference that one could draw was that the appellant thought that someone was monitoring his typing and that he intended to get reaction from whoever was monitoring the e-mail. There was no evidence that he was trying to elicit reaction from the user of the program.","An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.",e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment.

The defendant made an offer of settlement in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of costs, which take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation.

The plaintiff was awarded $5 million plus disbursements of $510.97 and the defendant was entitled to judgment for costs and disbursement. The amount of solicitor and client fees awarded was approximately $2,000.00. There is no tariff that provides direction with respect to the determination of the amountof costs in Chambers' applications.

"This appeal was taken under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the same basis as the previous grounds of appeal. 1) Market Mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The assessor calculated MAF of 0.94 for the mall. If it had been grouped with all other commercial retail buildings in its commercial building neighbourhood, its MAF would have been 0.65. 2) Each of the issues raised in this case was dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. Exactly the same reasoning applies here. 3) The court was able to divide the issue of abnormal functional obsolescence into two categories: 1) by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions in the Assessment Manual or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used; and 2) by creating a commercial building 'like a grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatoon.' It was not the ground for the decision but rather a result of the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.","An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed.

"The City applied to have the Director of Labour's Standards Branch issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the city owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages. At the hearing, the Director filed a letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay). The City brought this application to review theessment. At issue was whether an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday(holiday) or whether the City is obliged to pay overtime as required by the Act for hours worked over 32 in a week which has a holiday in it.

"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones and a 9 day video surveillance authorization authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the residence of the accused was issued in April 1997 primarily directed at the residences of the applicants. The Crown alleged that this action on the part of the police rendered the search unreasonable under s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: 1)Leave to cross-examine was granted in the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Leave should be left to the exercise the discretion thereof. 2)The authorization for the electronic surveillance was set aside as information obtained from the electronic monitoring was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants were derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. 3)The granting of leave to cross examine was not the preserve of the court. The granting of the leave to exercise the exercise was strictly for the discretion. Leave to cross cross-amine should be limited by the trial court to questions that are directed to establish that there was no basis upon which the authorization could have been granted. 4)The Crown did not err in arguing that the authorization should not be set aside. The appeal court held that R. v. West (1998), 12 C.R. (5th) 106, was a strong directive to that end. The court found that given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code there is no reason that the granting of a leave to examine should be the preserve OFA. The decision of R. vs. West was a reviewable decision. 5)The applicant’s evidence was admissible on an application to set off the authorization. The applicant”s counsel did not seek to call amplification evidence pursuant to s.(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. 6)The court reviewed the various breaches of the R.V. West Act and found that the Crown had not exceeded its authority in applying for the authorization and the accused were not at fault. 7)The accused were granted leave to apply for the privilege to cross question at trial pursuant to the provisions of s. 186(1)(b) of The Criminal Code and the Order of the","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.",6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT.

"At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. The constitutional question is not properly before me. 2)The three bylaws tendered were not to be amended. The zoning bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock. The amendments to the bylaw addressing the meaning of the word 'hamlet' did not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue. 3)The uncertainty on the part of the appellant's relying in attacking the bylaws did not exist. The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs did not refer to any amendments. The references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments; 4)The evidence had come into the possession and that it could have been admitted on appeal if, by due diligence, it could not have been adduced at trial, as R. v. Palmer (1979), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 and Carriere (2004 SKCA 80) were found to be relevant. 5)The trial justice made no error in law.

"This was an application for custody of the child. The mother had previously resided with her father in Nova Scotia and the father had moved away from Nunavut before he knew the mother was pregnant. Due to the unavailability of translation services and obtaining a transcript, the mother had been forced to change residence to Nova Scotia. The father had previously applied to Family Court for custody but had been denied. Finding for custody, that the child should be given custody. Custody should be granted to the father. The child had been in the mother's home for a few months and had been doing well in school. There was no evidence that any problems had been found. The paramount consideration was the child's best interests, which included retaining his first language (Inuktitut) and his culture. Access was every summer from the second week in July until September and including the third week in August which is seven full weeks.","This was a hearing to determine the proper venue for a custody hearing.

"The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments. Two of the plaintiffs, who were associated in the practice of law, filed an application for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The application was dismissed in accordance with the 1972 Rules because it was filed before December 31, 2008. The plaintiffs submitted that RBC was responsible for a considerable period of delay and that it acquiesced to a slow tempo of litigation. They alleged damages for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and breach of the contract. RBC counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity from RBC's solicitors in 1990. The Court refused to dismiss the action on the basis of (i) an inordinate delay; (ii) an inexcusable delay and (iii) the conduct of RBC, as a defendant, was to blame for the delay. It was not RBC who acquiesced or approved of the action. The solicitors did not file a list of documents. There were additional delays between the filing of the original Notice and the subsequent Notice of Intention to Proceed. There was additional time where nothing happened on the file due to delay by RBC. Even allowing for the two-and-a-half year delay, this means the delay of attributable to the plaintiffs was of some eight years.","The action, originally filed in 2000, concerned allegations of breach of - fiduciary duty, trust, industry regulations/standards, contract; and claims of negligence and malpractice. These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years).

HELD: 1) The Act does not permit the amendment of the Form discipline notice, since it is a statutory form. 2) The applicant argued the fundamental questions to be resolved were the issues of statutory interpretation, the fundamental unfairness in the process of the commission, the alternative remedies that must be resolved on a standard of correctness and the burden of previous finding, expeditiousness and costs. 3) The respondent argued the Court should not entertain the application as there is an adequate remedy, by way of appeal, provided for by the Act. The test to be applied was to determine whether the applicant's right to fair hearing should be limited to an application where there was insufficient notice of the investigation. 4) The alternative remedies were not adequate. 5) The convenience of the alternative remedy was held to constitute a bar because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and if an adequate alternative method of securing justice was available, it ought to be accessed. 6) There were no special circumstances existing in the scope of this application.

Although she had a good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy. Relief was granted. The Bankrupt had 13 years of student loans outstanding. The proposal was made because she was advised by a debt counsellor that it would be an effective way of satisfying her student loans. After completing the proposal, she learned that this advice was not correct. She was forced to pay a significant portion of the debt, say half of it, which would be a continuation of financial difficulty that prevented her from paying the loans. Any period longer would be too long.","The bankrupt, who had outstanding student loans of approximately $39,000, applied for relief under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

"HELD: The motion was granted. The court ordered that the accused be provided with full disclosure in usable format. The issue was whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence had been provided. The second issue was to be dealt with by 'Laporte inventory'. The court reviewed R. v. Laporte and found it appropriate to order the disclosure to be provided in a usable format so that it would be available to the defence in a reasonable fashion. The nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in reasonably accessible manner. It is not necessary to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. The use of hard copies for trial preparation is a reasonable resolution.","The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask.

The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order.

"The Crown applied for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to declare him a dangerous offender. The accused had been convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The Crown had applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an Order remanding him for an Assessment. The Court found that the accused demonstrated such indifference to the officers and to the public that an order of this magnitude was warranted. The court found that given the accused's lengthy criminal record and the fact that he had been involved in several violent offences over a period of time, it would appear that the predicate offence of this offence is one which is prerequisite to ordering an assessment. The offender did not show such indifference. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by s.752. The threshold is low and the accused did not engage in conduct that would result in serious harm or severe psychological damage. The offences were violent and the impact on the officer was significant. The fact that the officer had a gun with a bullet in it and used it on the accused when he was cornered by the police and the officer fired his weapon at the accused and the police officer was struck by the officer. As the accused had committed violent offences and was in the process of breaking up a family, one of the factors that led to his convictions was his desire to kill his wife. The victim had a history of violent offences, including one where he had threatened to stab the officer in the face. The evidence showed that the offender had a serious psychological injury offence, which was the basis of his criminal record. The judge concluded that the prospect of the accused being found to be a dangerous or long-term offender was within the realm of possibility or beyond it. The order should not be made as the predicate offense is not a serious injury offence and it is not within the realms of possibility that the person who is convicted of this would be a person of interest under s.786(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of that Code. The crime was a'serious personal injury' offence as determined by the Court. The sentences were set out in R. v. Peters, 2009 SKQB 350 (CanLII). The Crown and the Crown had agreed that a penitentiary sentence was warranted given the serious nature of the offence, the level of risk of harm, the accused’s past behaviour and the court’d hope that deterrence would outweigh the risk of a dangerous and long","The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.

"The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be opened nor for the police to take any statements or require the detainee to participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. This additional informational requirement on police ensures that detainee who persists in wanting to waive the right to counsel will know what it is that he is actually giving up. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper but the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s s. 8 Charter rights by failing to explicitly warn the police of the obligation to provide unequivocal advice to the accused once he has changed his mind about seeking legal counsel. 2) The respondent had not explicitly indicated that he would like to contact a lawyer. The Crown did not raise this issue with the learned judge. 3) On the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction to hold off from trying to elicit incriminating evidence from a detainee until a reasonable opportunity has been had, the Crown was required to explicitly state that it had not obtained a waiver of the right on the evidence. In this case, the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver once the police officer determined he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. 4) The holding-off requirement was not required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst. Lerat. In such circumstances, the burden of establishing a waiver is on the Crown.","The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated.

"The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration certificate and who had made payments on it under the original purchase agreement. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the security on the ground that she was at all times the real owner of the vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of the car. HELD: The claim of the Credit union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton. 1)The evidence of ownership is important but not the principal determinant of ownership. The Bank of Montreal case was one of several that dealt with the use of a title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by SGI. 2)The claim of a Credit Union was enforceABLE. The claim was not enforceable in the special circumstances of this matter.  3)The applicant had transferred ownership from her husband's estate to her name and such a transfer would only serve the purpose of defeating the Creditunion's claim if undertaken for value and without notice, which was not the case here.","The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.",d_2002skqb80.txt,"At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it.

"HELD: The Court granted the petitioner access to the family home and supervised access only for the respondent father. The Court held that the evidence suggested that the respondent had anger management problems that made her and their children fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that made it not in the best interests of the children and that their father had only supervised access to them. The respondent took the position that the petitioner's allegations of sexual abuse were unreliable and that there was a risk of harm. Therefore, the Court applied the Risk of Harm test, holding that the allegations were based upon speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and that the harm test was not accepted. The court found that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be beneficial. HELD: 1)The Court found that it was impossible to conclude from the evidence that there is anything to be taken from the incident that showed any improper behaviour on the part of the respondent. The evidence did not support the respondent's contention that he was the only person to put the children to bed. 2)The respondent was found to have been significantly involved in his children's lives beyond the level of most fathers who have normal work commitments. 3)Discretion was not appropriate. 4)The petitioner had provided factual evidence as background. Much of it is expressly disputed by the respondent or implicitly acknowledged by him. However, the onus is on parents who seek to restrict maximum contact to satisfy the court there is good reason to restrict contact. If the evidence is such that a proper assessment of the risk going forward can be made, the Chambers judge should do so.","HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children.

"FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction residential contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. In February 2012 counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial. At that time, Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, advised the plaintiffs and the Court that his corporation had recently been dissolved. That was later confirmed when a certificate of dissolution was filed with the Court. HELD: 1) The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. That would include not being permitted to cross-examine the plaintiffs' witness or to present its own case. 2) The Court was aware that there is case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. It was not prepared to follow those decisions but to follow other case law that supports the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. The Part 40 simplified trial shall continue on September 5, 2012. 3) The plaintiff and defendant corporation have given notice that they wish to cross examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's's case. Orion Morgan shall be produced for the purpose of cross-examination. The Court has concluded that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness that this matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed. If the liability of an unregistered corporation continues it is only fair that the struck or dissolved corporation should be allowed to defend itself in an action commenced before the dissolution of the corporation. If not, the Court will disregard the contents of her affidavit.","Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.

"The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home. It was owned by the defendants and their realtor, who was hired by the plaintiff to advise her that there had been a problem with the skylight in the house and that she could not realistically afford to buy the home. The defendant, who had recently purchased a new home, also misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, namely that the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site, in so doing, it is alleged that they breached the terms of the contract between them. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in her home.  1) The evidence from the realtor was that the house had been heated by wood, which caused cracks in the eaves, peepholes in the attic and a gas line onto the property. The rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences.  2) There was no discussion about home inspection. The realtor looked at nothing in particular since the rural municipality had not done any such inspections prior to 2000. The Rural Municipality of Corman Park did not inspect the property and did not provide a copy of the building permit. 3) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife for failing to obtain a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition in the contract for sale. The offer was made at the expense of the plaintiff. The husband was not the only one buying the property at the time. The wife was the primary caretaker of the home during the construction of the house. She was involved in the preparation of the PCDS and in the execution of the inspection. 4) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to costs in the amount of $1,000,000 for each year that she paid for the home, and that the husband was to pay $250,000 to have the home delivered. The PCDS would be incorporated into the agreement for a further 50 years. The parties were also entitled to solicitor-client costs. 5) Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

This was an application by the defendant to have Lienaux to remove himself as solicitor for the plaintiff on the basis of allegations of misconduct of another solicitor.

"The plaintiff practising lawyer commenced an action against the defendant in March 1999 for fees and disbursements in the amount of $4,647.85. On March 1999, Tapp obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (""SPMC""). In April 1999, the plaintiff obtained default judgment against SPMC. In May 1999, he made an ex parte application for payment out of the moneys which had been paid into court by SPPC. On April 13, 1999, an application was made by SPSC on Q.B.G. 969 of 1999 for an order pursuant to Rules 411 and 415(1) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court that the sum of $2,521.68 and any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the defendant company be paid into Court and disposed of as the court may direct in full satisfaction of SPMCs obligations to the various parties who may have a claim against the money. Tapp served all of the various interested parties with the notice of motion and the matter was heard in Chambers on June 17, 1999. No one appeared on behalf of the other parties. At the time of the application, the Minister of Labour had not obtained judgment against any defendant company and there was no certificate of the Minister on file.

"This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff had been dismissed from his position as president and chief executive officer of the corporation. STC awarded damages in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two instead of five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and that it was mere fledging.","On appeal from 106 SaskR 277. 47 year old respondent, former President and Chief Executive Officer of STC, had been awarded $165,000 (18 months) for wrongful dismissal.

"The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge misapplied the standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court found the warrant was quashed in error. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. However, the evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and the result would not necessarily have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and the observations about the basement were insufficient to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information. Therefore, the trial judge substituted his view of the law with that of the issuing judge.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.

"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were three or four vehicles ahead of the plaintiff, it would still be a haphazard guess to determine that the tail lights were on or working. The plaintiff also argued that she had been struck from behind by one of the defendants named in the action. Application allowed; costs in the cause of the action were set aside. The application was allowed in part because there was no 'air of reality' to the defence; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. To strike the plaintiff from behind on these facts would result in any on-going inability of her to work in any capacity; the bald statement in the pleadings did not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and could not fend off an application for summary judgement.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages. Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.

"The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession for trafficking and the other charge was stayed. Brooks applied pursuant pursuant to S. 20(4) of The Controlled Drug & Substances Authority for an Order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln is not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The application was dismissed. The sentence imposed would be grossly disproportionate to the offence and the offender would be sentenced to a standard of punishment not available to the general public but to the extent that the offender received the punishment prescribed in s. 11 of the Charter. The societal purpose of the Act and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property was stated in R. v. Gisby. The offender deserves the punishment that is available to her. The criminal justice system does not allow the granting of a standard punishment, but rather an order of forfeiture, which is the standard for successful forfeiture applications. The administration of justice is served by the court applying the s. 20 provision of the act. The provisions of the Criminal Drug and Substance Act (CDSA) provide the court with the tools to obtain relief from forfeiture. The CDSA does so both through punishment and deterrence. The driver of the Lincoln was found innocent of any complicity in the designated substance offence and Brooks was found not guilty. The judge concluded that the standard of treatment available to offenders is not available in the context of s. 12 of the charter. The court concluded that it would be appropriate to grant the relief sought by the applicant in this application, but not in this case, that the relief was only available to an accused who had been convicted of the designated substances offence and who exercised all reasonable care to avoid punishment. The Crown did not prove that Brooks consented to the illegal possession of the marijuana.","The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.",e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act.

"The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The issue on appeal was whether the father had withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000.  1) The evidence was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it. He did not err.  2) The Court held that a child who is over the age of majority is no longer a dependent child pursuant to s. 2(c) of the Act. It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.  3) The father was not seeking to further his education. The child had not withdrawn from the charge of his parents, since it was his intention at that time, and still is his intention to. 4) The order for support was not premised on the child's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. He was taking a hiatus from work to pursue a career in the field. 5) It was not the judge's position that the child should abandon his educational plans and immediately find employment. The evidence did not support his decision to seek employment.","The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.",d_2005nsca104.txt,"The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father.

"This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. This was an attempt to short-circuit the anticipated lengthy process under the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act by calling the Charter into play both to declare the right and to grant the specific remedy requested so that, if successful, the applicants could resume work at the beginning of the September 1990 university term. Allowing the application on the grounds the Charter does not apply, that the respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. In this case, the collective agreement between the respondent and the Faculty Association was not subject to the Charter nor was the applicant's claim for retroactive compensation analogous to the one granted in BC and Alberta.","This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay.

"The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. Sadly, the petitioner, Megan Wolfe, died of cancer in January 2015. The third party takes the position that it would be in the children’s best interests to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’�s Law Act, 1997. The designation does not bind the court when considering whether or not to grant person of adequate interest status to the grandmother after having heard all of the evidence at trial. It is generally applicable to screen out applicants who do not have both a significant relationship with the child and a demonstrated and ongoing commitment to the child. 2) The grandmother was to represent herself at trial and the Court would have considered whether the grandmother could have obtained an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. 3) The father represented himself. He was very prepared and he more than adequately conducted his case.","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent.

"The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The plaintiff had been injured in a motor vehicle accident and received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. After the accident, the plaintiff temporarily disabled himself and underwent physiotherapy at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. He applied to SGI for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for September 24, 1998 and the date of the plaintiff returning to his pre-accident employment.  1)Sawkiw's benefits were terminated October 23/98 pursuant to ss.185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. 2)The plaintiff was found to have a relapse under s. 142(1)(a) of The Personal Injury Protection Benefits Regulations as he was unable to perform certain farm duties and was required by SGI to attend physiotherapy sessions. 3)It was not clear how SGI expected the plaintiff to spend his time and energy in treatment and if he was entitled to interest on such an amount from the date such benefits should have been paid until the commencement date of his employment in Alberta.  4)SGI was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. The court found that SGI had prior knowledge the plaintiff was suffering from depression and it was not entitled to terminate the benefits. 5)Saskatchewan Government Insurance was awarded costs of preparing and filing notice of motion.","An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver.

HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work.

"The appellants sought leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave was required because the underlying proceeding was an application for leave to appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties.

The amendment was reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice in the sense which is relevant to this application. The amendments will not interfere with the date set for filing the appeal book or result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed.

"The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. He stated he was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years and an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years.  1) The defendant did not own a computer at the time he engaged in the activity. He had enrolled at the University of Saskatchewan in 2005 in Latin course. He used the university computers to engage in the activities. 2) There was no evidence to support the conditional sentence as the defendant had no criminal record and was now serving the social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lived on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 3) The Court accepted the defendant's submission that child pornography writings do not harm children the way production of images does and should not be subject to the same denunciation. It cannot be assumed that writings stimulate the demand for images which do directly harm children. Not all pedophiles are voyeurs. Some will act on their desires. Anything that stimulates that desire places children at risk in the real world. 4) The sentence imposed on the defendant was considerably shorter than the maximum sentence of 12 months imprisonment, which would result in a sentence of three years probation. The Court took into account the mitigating factors referred to in the pre-sentence report, such as the fact that the defendant did plead guilty and did not have a criminal record, the limited information available that he would not endanger the community if one wereimposed. A conditional sentence would not bestrong enough to deter others who might be inclined to engage the activity of distributing child porn.","Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

"The court refused to issue summonses to the defendant in an action for breach of a trust agreement. The defendant had submitted 18 claims for issuing to the court on behalf of the claimants. The judge had refused, on the grounds that the claims were frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of the court's process.

The supplementary decision concerned whether the defendant should issue summons pursuant to s. 7(1) of The Small Claims Act, or alternatively by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made.

FIAT: The petitioner paid the respondent an annual sum of $6,000. The court concluded that relief should be given but in-the circumstances it must not take spousAL support. The petitioner had the means to pay $500 per month. The Court noted that the respondent does not need financial assistance. He is the registered owner of the farm land and receives the entire rental income. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the wife brought into the marriage. In total there is a section of land one quarter of which contains the matrimonial home. The home is one of the few remaining pieces of land left to the husband. The Matrimonial Home is another source of revenue and the petitioner has de facto possession of the land. The rental income is 33% of his present income of $630.

The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15).

"The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their daughter from an earlier relationship. That child is from an 11 year old. The petitioner and the respondent live together in a five-bedroom home. It would appear that the relationship between the parties spanned the years 2000 to 2007. They moved at the same time, bringing with him his two daughters. The parties had been married for four years. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple parents and multiple siblings. The confusion that this has caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of the petitioner. 2) The respondent demonstrated he is a person of sufficient interest with respect to the child. He did not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. Because of the familial relationship among the parties and the amount of time that the petitioner allowed to elapse before commencing his petition, access is not granted to the respondent. 3) The relationship spanned five years, commencing when the petitioner was barely a toddler. Over those years, the relationship span span from time to time. The respondent provided care for the child, participated in activities with the school and was intermittently involved in their lives. 4) In this case, the respondent demonstrated that he was a person with sufficient interest. He demonstrated he had, and has, the same status as a parent. The presumption that it is in the petitioner's best interests that she have access to him is more consequence to the legal position that the respondent has argued than to the fact that he has a high risk of harm. 5) The Court must consider a variety of factors including the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and quality of the relationship with the person who is seeking access, how the relationship was represented to the world and whether the applicant provided financially for the petitioner in the circumstances of this case.","The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.

"HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. Given that the video evidence and the testimony of corrections officers, it was not legally necessary to establish that the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries caused to the victim fell within the definition of wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life. The accused”s position in the trial was based on the concept of “parties to the offence”, “principal offender” and secondary offender. The three elements of s. 34(2) have both subjective and objective components: (1) the accused reasonably believed that he was assaulted; (2) that he caused the injuries to Dorion; (3) that his belief in himself was objectively reasonable on the basis of the situation that he perceives; and (4) that knife believed on reasonable grounds that he could not otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of Dorion. In all of the circumstances, the Crown established that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by the accused as a consequence to the plot to which he was a party. The court reviewed the various pieces of evidence and concluded that the existence of an actual assault was not a prerequisite for the defence under s.34(2). All three elements must be established: the subjective perception of the accused, the objective foresight of specific wounds, and the fact that his group moved in unison with the purpose of attacking the victim.","In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.",e_2011skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant.

"The appellant contended the trial judge erred in law by applying the doctrine of recent possession mainly because there was no evidence that he was in recent possession of the stolen Chevrolet Blazer. Dismissing the appeal, that although the evidence was circumstantial, the facts he found to be proved led to no other reasonable inference than the guilt of the appellant. The appellant ran from the vehicle and made the tracks in the snow which were followed by the police. The time periods for each and all of these events were consistent with his findings of fact.","This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.
