b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.",[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Conclusion [SUMMARY] The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order would be issued and primary care would remain with the mother. The parties also agreed that the parties should share joint custody of the three children. The mother was to have exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and the father was to pay basic guideline support of $650 per month. The father was opposed to the payment of spousal support in any form. He argued that he did not earn enough to pay such an expense and that the mother did not need it. HELD: 1)The parties did not agree on the appropriate date for valuation. The evidence showed that the father had been extensively involved in the operation of the property since it was purchased and the couple considered this property to be a joint business operated for the benefit of the family. 2)The mother's position was that the children had always wanted to study divinity and that they would forfeit this claim if she was awarded Bazoun Enterprises Limited. 3)The court reviewed the economic circumstances of the parties and found that they did not suffer any economic hardship as a result of the breakdown of the marriage. 4)The children were to remain with their mother until the end of the school year. 5)Spousal Support was requested. She did not seek periodic support but rather a lump sum payment to cover her tuition at the school.
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This was an application by the Director under the Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in right of Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There is no retroactive issue. The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 legislation thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture application must be assessed from that perspective alone. 2)Both the terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. Both applied the same legal test and standard of proof."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT: The father applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under an order of Archambault J. in 1996. The father was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. He argued that his decision to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it would be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. HELD: 1)Any sharing of s. 7 special expenses should be based on the father's imputed income of $40,000 and the mother's income of approximately $39,000. 2)The father was underemployed at the time of the order. He did not have the financial means to continue with his employment and to only work three months of the year. 3)On all of the evidence, the father was found to have made an aggressive and intentional effort to obtain full-time employment. The court found that the father had made an impulsive and intentional decision, which was not a reasonable one when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child, Stephanie. 4)The court ordered costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force him to disclose financial information."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession.

8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached.

e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The parties agreed to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. The respondent did not suggest that there had been any change in his hours of work or work schedule. What had changed was that his mother was no longer available to provide child care during his access weekends. The court found that these orders were made in order to provide some predictability for the children. The Court found that the respondent's income was reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion and that such loss as was caused by his cattle is minimal. The defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act and further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same - the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by the straying cattle."
b_1995canlii5775.txt,"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors.

The fact that any payment to the unsecured creditors is dependant upon successful negotiations with the Bank of Montreal, Prairie Security fund and an outside investor means the proposal is effectively nothing more than a 'holding proposal'. 3)The Court must also consider the conduct, conduct and future of the debtor and the requirements of commercial morality."
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This appeal is from an order of a Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

Whether one approaches the question from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s.5.3, or from the context of the entire statute, or a purposive approach, the result is the same.

e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff brought action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention is that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The Court could not find on the evidence that clear instructions had been given to the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, thereby causing any damage to the premises.  2)The plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: 1)It was impossible for the Town to recover the costs of the damage sustained. It would have been impossible to assess the likelihood of the plaintiff's property being damaged by the water being shut off.  3)No amount could be negotiated by the Town with respect to costs."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The parties applied to vary spousal and child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The parties claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. Macdonald's improved employment and income situation. They also sought a lump sum spousa support of $20,000 to compensate for relocation expenses. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for support purposes was $41,000 and he was to pay $567.00 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. 2) Costs were to be determined based on the respondent's net income of $29,000.00 for the purposes of paying child support and $8,000 for moving expenses. 3) Costs should be determined on the basis of income, ability to pay and need.  4) Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the court found that the respondent should not have to use the assets or RRSPs she received on the matrimonial division in order to re-establish herself. Otherwise the effect could be significant."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify.

Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion.

HELD: The division of the balance of the property was to be postponed to determine whether or not the profits therefrom (if any) could lower the debts outstanding enough that it became a viable farm operation. The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claimed this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. The evidence supports this position so I ordered a division of property divided based on the respondent wife's estimated net worth and the respondent husband's 44% of the estimated asset value. When all of the assets were liquidated and it was determined what amount was actually available for division, the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the November spousal maintenance order in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

HELD: 1)The bankrupt was granted a conditional order of discharges requiring him to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee.  2)The court found that the application for discharge was being opposed by certain creditors. A review of the possible orders that may be granted by the court under s. 172 indicated that the decision need not necessarily be of final nature. 3)There was no evidence that Parliament intended the disclosure provisions to stretch beyond what would be reasonable for enforcement of the ITA and the Excise Tax Acts."

The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in an accident at the farm property. He had been out all night at social event, had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before the tragedy and were informed by the tragedy. However, he was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. Punishment should be mitigated by Mr. Sutherland's lesser degree of culpability and he also has no prior record for safety violations. The evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues prior to the accident and had endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm. HELD: The joint recommendation of counsel for a total penalty of $25,000 was a significant penalty for the defendant. It was material to the court that the evidence in the farm showed clearly the defendant's conscientiousness for the offence of failing to take reasonable precautions to address the problem of the damaged barricade having been removed at the entrance of the muck pit. The penalty should include significant contribution by the defendant to farm safety initiatives."

The court, however, in view of the third party claim by Labour Standards directed that the application for payment be made by notice of motion and that all parties interested in the funds should be served. 2) The Minister was only party to the $337.46 payment.  3) Although the plaintiff had obtained a default judgment on May 27, 1999 and then made an application to the Supreme Court of Queen's Bench for payment, he was only the party to be entitled to that money. 4) No certificate had been filed with the court as to the date of the application. No certificate was entered into court with the plaintiff's name on it.  5) Although there had been a judicial decision by the registrar of the court in July 1994, no judicial decision had been entered by the Registrar of the Court in any event.  6) The claim was dismissed with costs."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum."

The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.",[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The court dismissed the application for examination on the Moore affidavit.  2) It was important to note that we are in the pre-certification stage of this proceeding and this is still an 'action' and not a 'class action'. This is still a 'action'. The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. 3) The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of the jurisdiction to allow for examination of witnesses prior to certification.
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out in Rimmer v.

At the time of the judgment, the respondent was 60 years old and the respondent 53. The respondent had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. After the marriage, the parties had been separated for 24 years. The appellant had assumed a substantial portion of the respondent's support during the year following the one year order. The evidence did not establish that the respondent had engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. Finally, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in probationary position. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had surgery followed up by radiation in 2006. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The judge substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP and found that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the results of the search would not necessarily have been the same.

9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.

There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] A maintenance application was heard before Justice Tidman who delivered an oral decision at its conclusion. The father argued that the child had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from the charge of his parents since it was his intention at that time, and still is his intention, to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution. Dismissing the appeal, that the order for support was not premised on the child's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of a university education. The child had made great strides but had not and will not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis. 1)Section 2(c) of the Child Maintenance and Custody Act provides that a child may remain dependent even where over the age of majority, if '. unable, by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to withdraw and/or provide himself with reasonable needs.' 2)Section 30 of the Act prohibits consideration of that income when fixing child support.  3)The Court was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] An application under s15(1) and (7) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of applicants as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. The respondent has been free of any influence of the government with regard to its pension and retirement policies. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. What is at issue in this case is not an act directly mandated by government and calculated to affect the public, but the performance of a subordinate body created and supported by government. It is governmental action. 3)Subject to Section 17 of the Pulic Service Superannuation Act, for all purposes the Board shall be deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province and such employment shall be considered public service."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] At a meeting of the creditors to the project and the principals of the company, the plaintiffs sought information as to the reason why they disbursed funds from mortgage draws on the basis that they had been postponed. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground. There was no evidence that Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he retained by the plaintiffs or purposed in any way to act for them or on their behalf."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate for the manslaughter conviction. The court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel, including the totality principle and the Gladue factors, and found that the global sentence was appropriate in this case because of the multiple factors relevant to the manslaughter case. The Court also considered the fact that the accused had previously pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so, which was a separate and distinct offence."

The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue.

When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance.

Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

Excluding any component for aggravated damages the plaintiff was awarded a fair award for general damages of $12,500.  2) Aggravated damages are simply variety (or possibly sub-head) of non-pecuniary damages. They too compensate for intangible loss, but in particular for hurt feelings caused by the nature of the defendant's conduct. The injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the assault were serious but not life threatening.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The applicant applied for an amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. The respondent argued that the judgment in that particular requires amendment since there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made by counsel for the parties. HELD: The application for fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  1) The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September of 1996. 2) The respondent's position was that the whole estate should be transferred to satisfy the applicant's maintenance. 3) The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. 1) It is clear that the court possesses an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. The Court's discretion arises out of its inherent equitable jurisdiction and out of Rule 542 of The Queen's Bench Rules. Rule 184C allows the court to take into account offers of settlement that do not meet the requirements of the Act. In this case, the applicant characterizes herself as the successful litigant.  4) In the circumstances, am satisfied that should reconsider the matter of costs since the applicant had intended to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of it and that evidence and submissions do have a direct bearing on the issue of s. 30 of The Executions Act. 5) The court is the court of last resort on that issue."

Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow.

That being so, and since the period could not be extended in the absence of power of enlargement in the statute, the Court held that the appeal could not have been exercised properly. 2)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The plaintiff asserted that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. In the alternative, the defendant claimed that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his holiday pay. HELD: Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage and this portion of his truck allowance. Any debt for the April 1990 to March 1991 holidays would have arisen within the statutory period of six years. 1)The plaintiff clearly indicated that the portion of truck allowance that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his termination was not in lieu of holidays as it was really part of his wage and only designated as an allowance to avoid taxation. 2)It would be contrary to public policy for the plaintiff to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating his holiday payments on the basis of his wages and his truck expense allowance. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. 3)HELD: The jury trial should proceed with respect to the issues of liability and damages. The defendant claims that if the court finds the plaintiff’s contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 4)The defendant asserted that holiday pay should be based on his wage, plus one-half of his Truck Allowance. He also claimed holiday pay on the amount awarded by the jury as damages. 5)The court reviewed the case of Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service Ltd. (1999), 177 Sask. R. 197. In that case, the court found that the defendant had jurisdiction to entertain civil action for non-payment of holiday pay in the amount of $8.00 per hour. 6)The Court reviewed the circumstances of the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to his claim for holiday pay and found that, even if the plaintiff claimed his right for 10 years, the time the plaintiff spent away from work must be"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused were charged with two counts of defamatory libel.

HELD: The Court found that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes a reasonable limit in free and democratic society on the freedom of expression guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter and is of no force or effect. The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 1)The accused were found guilty of publishing a matter without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of [the police officer] by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to insult him knowing that the matter published was false. 2)The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by s300 of the Code, not only the expressions involved."

The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: 1) the INFORMATION sworn in support of the application for the search failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search; more particularly, the generality of the foregoing, the said Information was deficient in the following respects: the sole ground upon which the Information is based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in supporting the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. 2) the grounds of belief set out in the information must be such as would satisfy a reasonable man.

HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The court found that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. Counsel for Montgrand also appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest. 1) Section 198 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. 2) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102, which states that the interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's income (IRB) by 90% and not the other types of earners. The IRB is calculated on a formula of the gross yearly employment income (GEOI) less deductions under the provincial and federal income tax acts, premiums under the Unemployment Insurance Act (Canada), and contributions to the Canada Pension Plan (Canada). 3) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRB for both the first 180 days and the post 180 day period to SGI.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT: The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for a summary judgment application. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing. 2) The Court accepts the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and still concludes that there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The court puts forward a realistic assessment of an appropriate notice period of 7 months. Taking the factors into consideration, it seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship. 4) Where dismissal does result after one of more warnings, the category of misconduct can change from one of poor attitude to one of disobedience or insubordination. 5) In this case the alleged misconduct was not a cause for termination but rather, the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. 6) The plaintiff's griping occurred after it fell to him to perform the duties of the defendant in addition to his own duties. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. The Court puts only the amount of notice the plaintiff was entitled to for the notice period based on his income and value of benefits for the previous 12 months, less the six weeks' pay he received, and less the wages and value"
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code.

A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence as the defendant qualifies for the same to be given to him to be counselled in the appropriate time. 3) The sentencing guidelines for the defendant were that he should be given 15 months incarceration followed by 3 years probation. 4) There was no evidence that he would endanger the community if a sentence were imposed. 5) The court took into consideration mitigating factors such as his lack of a criminal record or plea to a charge of distribution of child pornography and the fact he had no prior criminal record which would not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing the child pornography."

The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and then his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. 2)On a balance of probabilities, the accused has shown that he exercised due diligence, or took reasonable care, on this date. Based on his evidence and the findings of fact, the Crown has proved that the accused drove careless. The Court reviewed four areas of the test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, as adopted and applied to this offence in Kozun. The first part was whether the accused exercised due care or attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness. The court accepted the accused's evidence that the most direct route to the area he was called to was proceeding straight south along this road, passing directly to the east of Super Store and then connecting to Highway and subsequently to the bypass leading to the south-west area. 3)The Court accepted that the officer's vehicle did not move very short distance forward before striking the accused. The officer did not swear at the accused and did not threaten to sue him and cause him to be fired from his employment."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. His driver's license was revoked and he was charged with driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked. The only issue at trial was whether this made the accused guilty of the offence of driving the motor vehicle while his license was revved. HELD: The Court found that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an  ATV. The offence was committed while his 'driver's license' was revoked because there was no nexus between his driving of the vehicle and the revocation of his driver's licence."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court declined to issue summonses as requested. The issues raised by these claims are important issues to the potential plaintiffs, and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen’s Bench, by either issuing a new claim or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made."

There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. The respondent denied coverage and refused to defend the action in the name and on behalf of the insured on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the duty to defend arises only when the claim alleges state of facts which, if proven at trial, would fall within the coverage provided by the policy. As the plaintiff has failed to do so, the insurer is under no obligation to defend. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge erred in his decision regarding indemnity when he determined that the policy did not provide coverage for that which was alleged in the pleadings. The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 2)The Court of Appeal was in a good position to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) of the Act by deciding that the claim against the insured is not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the insurance policy. A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(1)."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal from the dangerous driving conviction was dismissed. The trial judge found that the accused intentionally drove in a manner which he knew created a danger for others, and drove in such a manner that the complainant consented to the application of force. The appellant was entitled to considerable deference with respect to how she treated the complainant. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision."

The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of about one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm.

HELD: 1)No bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-2006 year. No bonus was requested by the plaintiff. The parties conducted their business together according to the terms of the October 20, 2004 agreement with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to sixty cents per day per cow. Another sixty calves were delivered to Dobson's pastures in the spring and early summer of 2006. 2)The plaintiff did not contemplate payment of a bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May. He agreed in cross-examination that he had heard some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he felt he couldn't charge that much. 3)There was no consensus as to the amount of the bonus to be paid for each live calf that he got to pasture."

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-residents to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither the Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion."

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)Evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications was validly obtained and executed in a bona fide way. Evidence of other offences gathered during the valid process is admissible. 2)The evidence was non-conscriptive evidence and was properly admitted. 3)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. 4)The respondent had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that information concerning the alleged offence would be obtained through the interception sought.
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means.

The relationship spanned years 2000 to 2007, commencing when the child was barely a toddler. Over those years, Lawrence provided care for the child and was involved in activities with the family. 3) The respondent did not have a financial interest in bringing the application. 4) There was no evidence at trial as to whether or not the respondent had a reasonable expectation that the child would be better served by having access to him."

The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the prison. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there was no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertained to how his actions ought to be characterized. Section 34(2) of the Criminal Code attaches criminal responsibility to a person as party to an offence if that person, with the requisite intent, plays any one of three roles in the offence. If the person actually commits the offence, liability follows; (b) the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the actions of the accused were done in self-defence as contemplated by s.34(2).

Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff corporation applied to set aside its default judgment on the basis of an interlocutory Notice filed March 2, 1995. The defendant applied pursuant to Rule 12.06 (dismissal of default judgment) for the following reasons: 1) that there were triable issues between the parties. 2) that the deliberate decision not to attorn to the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia courts should not be regarded as a reasonable excuse for failing to file a defence. 3) that any irregularities which may have prompted the issuance of the default judgment are not such as to cause the Court to find that the Order is nullity. It was not a mistake or an oversight. Although technically, the plaintiff ought to have sought the Court's leave to take default under Civil Procedure Rule 25.03 because the statement of claim had combined a request for declaratory relief with a claim for what I consider to be liquidated damages, such a procedural omission did not materially affect the defendant."

The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal was allowed with respect to the amount of the deficiency judgment and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment against the appellants.

The amount owed to the appellant was reduced to $31,160.23 as the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed. The court reviewed the decision of the previous Chambers judge and found that the proceeds of sale should be applied to the purchase money portion of the loan and not the non-purchase money portion. It also held that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to debt affected by s. 25 of the LCRA. The respondent appealed the decision and sought a determination as to the extent to which s.25 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for a mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings were the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision."

The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,"[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. For reasons which I will discuss later in this decision, where there is a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and that of the accused, I accept the evidence.  1) The mental element of the offence of refusal created by Section 254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. 2) The officer was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample. He was attempting to supply sample as directed by the officer. The officer testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District on the date in question with 'ride-along'. He testified that when the police vehicle approached his vehicle from the rear, its lights were very bright. He reached over and “flipped” the rear view mirror of his vehicle and pulled over to the right as he did not want this vehicle to continue to follow him. He stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. He waited for the ready light to come on. He said he thought he may have been having difficulty blowing sufficient sample for the officer, but then ceased the test. 3) There was no evidence that the officer had phoned another officer while administering the tests and informing that officer that he could not understand why things did not work on the night in question although he did remember the officer telling him it was like blowing up a balloon."

When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT: The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated a hostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement made shortly after her arrest. The Crown sought to use the prior statement, but for thedemonstrably false portion, as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)The statement did not meet the test for reliability set out in R. v. K.G.B. (1993). 2)The evidence of the witness was insufficient to support the Crown's claim that she was unreliable. 3)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 4)The credibility test was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the statement met the threshold of reliability. 5)Annette Cook's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its witnesses."

If he does not have particulars of the statutes and regulations, he must so state. 2) The court was not prepared to strike the phrases 'without limiting the generality of the foregoing' and 'without limitation'. The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The Government of Saskatchewan sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.
