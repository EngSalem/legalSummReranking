b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the irproperty. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","[STRUCTURE] Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order would be issued for the three children. The mother was to have exclusive possession of the matrimonial home and primary care was to be given to the father. The father opposed the payment of spousal support in any form. He argued that it was unnecessary and imminent. The wife sought authorization to obtain passports, expressed concern over possible flight risk, and sought a restraining order prohibiting the father from leaving the province with the children. Both parents were firmly settled into their local community. Awarding the mother $15,000 for her contribution, that the children will have the opportunity to become involved in many extracurricular activities in the future, and that she must give him notice of the activity and the cost of the tuition at the Atlantic School of Theology."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.",[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the property was proceeds of unlawful activity and that the Director should have acted pursuant to the legislation in place at the time. The Court accepted the Director's argument that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The Director also argued that there was no retroactive issue with respect to the property seized prior to its coming into force. The purpose of the legislation was to set out the test the court must apply in determining whether a forfeiture application should be made.
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT: The father applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which have accumulated under the Archambault J. order. The primary questions to be answered were: 1) what is the father's current income; 2) should the child support variation be retroactive; 3) should he be underemployed? The father's decision to work only three months of the year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not Mr. Pilat has, indeed, been successful on this motion. On all of the evidence, it is clear that Pilat's financial position has not changed as a result of the order for child support; on the evidence it appears that he has not made any aggressive moves to obtain employment which will severely limit the father’s income for a period of some time; and 4) that he may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation. It is very likely that the father has made a strategic decision to terminate his employment within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The court had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in this proceeding."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason [SUMMARY] The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision the Rentalsman granted.

8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings. 1)There had been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay. No explanation was offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather. 2)There was no waiver of the delay for these periods. The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007. Inherent time requirements led to some delay. The accused alleges that the passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. Actions of the accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. 3)The court found that the prejudice to the accused outweighs the public interest in having her tried for the charge."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The respondent served an application to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as the access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The respondent did not suggest any change in his hours of work or work schedule, what had changed was that his mother was no longer available to provide child care on his access weekends. The petitioner had custody of their two children, Rikki-Lee, age 12 and Lucas, age 7. The consent order provided that the respondent was to pay child support in a specified amount based upon his income. The question is whether there has been any material change in the circumstances of the children since the pre-trial conference.  1) Once there is a material change upon a material level, it becomes apparent that the amount agreed to be paid becomes inappropriate. 2) The respondent's income is reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. It was the understanding the children no longer attended institutional daycare. The fact that someone may come into the home to provide childcare is of no consequence. 3) The Court found that the imputation of income was not the same as the imputed income and there had been no material change. The Court ordered that the petitioner was not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The plaintiff admits that his cattle were in the Plaintiff's crop on one occasion but further denies that he was negligent in looking after his cattle. HELD: Judgment in favour of the plaintiff and pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. Under both the present s.27 (1) and the pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the field unbeknownst to the plaintiff, his spouse, his brother or his hired help."

3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] This appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way.

e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff brought action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention was that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. 1)There was no negligence on the part of the Town of Martensville in allowing the plaintiff to have her water service disconnected and, therefore, no order as to costs.  2)The plaintiff did not sign any authorization to this effect. Rather, she registered the transfer documents herself and did not discuss any adjustment of the purchase price. 3)No signature was required or obtained on the back of the form. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the price of the property."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998.

She also sues the defendants for negligence in misrepresenting certain facts and breaching the fiduciary duty expected of her. HELD: Judgment for the defendants. 1) The realtor was not qualified to work for the plaintiff as she was a single mother and her income from the sale of the home was minimal. She was not entitled to rely on the PCDS. The PCDS was incorporated into the agreement with the defendants as a condition of the contract for sale.  2) The defendants were found liable in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the plaintiff.  3) The plaintiff was awarded aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against them for aggravated and general damages of $250,000."
7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The parties applied to vary spousal and child support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than 1 year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The husband claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. MacDonald's improved employment and income situation. The wife counter-claimed for relocation expenses, which she alleged would affect her ability to pay child support. HELD: The application to vary was granted. The lump sum award was to continue until the $8,000 lump sum was paid.  1) Considering the couple's combined income for support purposes of $41,000 and the fact that the wife had moved and purchased her own home less than two years after the trial award, it would appear there was a current need for a lump sum in support to compensate for the wife's relocation expenses. 2) Considering that the parties had not addressed the issue of costs directly pending the court's decision, it was apparent that the husband had not established an immediate need for lump sum support. There should be stability of payments, both for the recipient and the payor.  3) The husband was to pay $567 per month in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guides. 4) The wife was to bear the costs of moving."

Granting the application, that even though the court has made a discretionary decision based on submissions of counsel, there has been no controversy as to the events leading up to the witness not being available at the date of the trial. In any event, there was sufficient evidence before the court to satisfy the court that the decision had to be based on affidavit evidence, and there was no such evidence as put forth by the applicant. The court was also satisfied that the Crown had cooperated with the defence in setting dates and co-operating to the extent that they apparently fumbled on one of the subpoenas. The trial judge granted the adjournment. The preliminary issue raised by the Crown is as to whether or not the extraordinary remedies of a prerogative writ, in this case certioraris and an ordered of prohibition, is in fact and appropriate remedy. refer to s. 669.1, subsection (2) of the Criminal Code: Any court, judge or provincial court officer having jurisdiction to try an accused or defendant, or any clerk or any other proper officer of the court, or in the case of an offence punishable on summary conviction, any justice may, at any time before or after the plea of the accused is taken, adjourn the proceedings. The Crown has also referred me to Section 571 of the Code.HELD: The application was dismissed. It is within the jurisdiction or power of a trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the relevant sections of The Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. By jurisdiction is meant the authority to decide case, to determine an issue, not the nature or correctness, actual or perceived of the determination made.

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder.

The claim by the Minister of Labour was dismissed. Although the monies paid into court according to the decision in Polyco Window Manufacturing Ltd v.

On March 9, 1999, the plaintiff obtained a garnishee summons issued prior to judgment against the said defendant and served it on Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). As a result, the defendant garnished a judgment against Tapp, who was the only party entitled to the moneys. $337.46 was paid into court to the credit of Q.B.G. 639. In April 1999, Tapp served all of the various parties with the notice of motion and the matter was heard in Chambers. No one appeared on behalf of the other parties. At the time of the application for payment out, the Minister of Labour had not obtained judgment against either defendant company and there was no certificate issued with respect to the registration of the company. A judgment against SPMC had been entered in 1994. No certificate had been issued with regard to the amount paid into Court as of the date of this application. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)No certificate was issued by the registrar of the Court of Queen's Bench indicating that the defendant had paid the money into court. 2)There was no evidence that the Minister had entered judgment against any of the parties who may have a claim against the money. A judicial certificate must be filed with the Registrar as to the date the judgment was entered. 3)The claim of the plaintiff was dismissed with costs."

For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should have been, but that is not the issue. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. Indeed they were inserted on the premises he had been in the service of the Province for 10 years.  2)The trial judge rejected the trial judge's request and took the whole of Larsen's Crown corporation service into account. 3)Costs were set aside and the payment of dismissal was determined in accordance with common law principles. 4)The appellant was awarded $165,000 for damages totalling $148,500."

Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that these members had all ready entered into full and final settlements with the plaintiff and were not entitled to be part of the action against the defendant. The defendant moved to dismiss the motion on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased the package. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court dismissed the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. The purpose of the affidavit was not to challenge the plaintiff's version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the defendant but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of the plaintiff about other customers who may have booked through her office with the defendant during the purposed class. The examination may be more broad ranging than that and could be an attempt to get information from Red Seal itself as to its customer data base that may have been relevant to the plaintiff during the relevant time.  1) The Court's usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. It has found that the plaintiff has the ability to cross examine defendant on an affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence. 2) The wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act in particular creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. There have not been any previous cases in which a plaintiff was allowed to cross-examine a defendant prior to certification of an action as a class action. 3) There is nothing in the statute that could be characterized as unfair to a defendant. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objections. It was not necessary to broaden the scope of the statute to include a suspension of the limitation period for actions that have already been certified. The Court is cognizant of the fact that the statute does not permit the Court to make orders prior to certifying an action. 4) In this case, the plaintiff did not seek through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor did it seek to have this court direct Inco to change any portion of the material. Rather, it is important to remember that we are in the pre-certification stage of this proceeding. This is still an 'action' and not a '"
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced.

The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. 3) The proper income for the appellant was in the neighbourhood of $30,000. It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable to become self sufficient.

Defendant granted an order compelling the OSB Superintendent to testify at the hearing of the charter motions. Application dismissed; there is no basis to compel the Superintendent's attendance and the testimony and documentation presented since the Subpoena was quashed raise issues which warrant compelling him's attendance.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The Crown appealed the validity of a search warrant issued against the respondent. The judge quashed the warrant, finding that it was issued without sufficient information. The Crown argued that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the judge erred in law by holding otherwise. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge's standard of review was incorrect. The evidence obtained as a result of the search was wrongly excluded and the result would not have been the same. However, the appeal should be allowed and a fresh trial ordered to determine whether the judge applied the proper test for reviewing the warrant. The court found that even with all the evidence gathered, there was still a reasonable ground to believe that the respondent had been involved in a marijuana grow operation and that there was evidence of it to be found in the place of search. Therefore, the decision to quash the warrant was not quashed in error."

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal was allowed. The decision of the hearing officer was set aside and the matter remitted back for re-hearing. The court found the reasons for the decision were inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and that the matter must be returned to the Hearing Officer. As s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act is an appeal on the record, affidavit evidence is inadmissible. While the tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. As the tenants had filed separate claims under the Act, the two claims should have been heard together; the third ground of appeal failure to properly serve was abandoned on appeal."

The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused pled guilty to a robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code.

From all of the evidence and applying the McKenzie analysis, the Court was satisfied that these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion the defendant was in the company of the girls."
e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The Crown applied pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Fair was found guilty of possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Crown sought to have the Lincoln forfeited to its owner. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purposes of trafficking. She had also been convicted of possession for trafficking. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed and the Lincoln was declared to be not subject to forfeiture. 1)The Court must first consider the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the owner, the strength of his or her moral claim to innocence and the sufficiency of all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to be used in the commission of a designated substance offence. 2)Section 20(4) prescribes the powers of the court upon the hearing of an application for relief from forfeiture pursuant to ss.19(3) and s.20(4). In this case, the registered owner was the driver and 28.3 pounds of marijuana were in two plastic bags stacked one on top of each other in the trunk of the Lincoln. There was no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the testimony of Constable Baulkham. 3)It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions because the Crown consented to Brooks' submission being viewed as an application by the Crown. The Court must consider the societal purpose of the Act, and the forfeiture provisions thereof, and their application to the Supreme Court of Canada, s.11(d) being Schedule to the Canada Act."

The applicant, which leased six school buildings from the Roman Catholic Church, submitted the respondent was required to reimburse the applicant for leasing costs. For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval. Because the applicant failed to report to the Minister, the respondent was not required to pay the leasing costs. Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the applicant board. Included in the fifty-five schools are six school buildings leased by the Cape Breton Board from the Catholic Episcopal Corporation (the 'Church'). It is the responsibility for payment of the leasing cost on these buildings that is now before the Court. The issue is whether the Minister of Education is required to reimburse the CapeBreton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing the school buildings from the Church. HELD: The Court granted the order. The lease costs were to the same extent as would be the cost of supplying the building free of costs to the Board. There was no suggestion any of the buildings were not required to meet the basic needs of the students now attending the school.  1)In light of the entire Act, which regularly requires the Minister's approval, that board could enter into any lease for the rental of buildings for school purposes without the approval of the Minister. Absent the report, under s.50(1) and s.33(7)(d) of the Education Act, there is no obligation on the part of the Board to pay the rent associated with the leases. 2)The Court agreed with the Board that, where the Minister received a request in the proper form and determined that it was necessary to lease a school building in order to meet its statutory obligation, the cost was the responsibility of the board."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] After a serious brain injury, the 19 year old continued to suffer from his injuries, required close supervision and was unable to work or further his education. He was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $2,000. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was no evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was inappropriate and therefore depart from it. The Court found that the 19-year-old had not withdrawn and was not unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. The consent order provided that the child would be in his father's custody, with reasonable access by his mother. It was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order as the guideline amount was not inappropriate."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC [SUMMARY] The plaintiff sues the defendant for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The defendant had been retained by the plaintiff to deal with a second mortgagee to the project and had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged would require him to pay mortgage draws in a particular manner. The project had been financially tight from the beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff sought postponements of the letters of directions in order to minimize the potential for a mortgage draw to disrupt the project's viability. Defendant granted written acknowledgement of each letter of direction in full force and effect; plaintiff's claim dismissed; there was no evidence the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs or retained by them or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf."

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, to a concurrent sentence of one year concurrent for the possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so and a 10 year global sentence. The accused had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. He had shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. The evidence showed that the accused had temporarily overcome his demons with alcohol, and had rewarded his cousin by rewarding him with a firearm in the death of his cousin and allowing him to live with a greater degree of remorse. There were numerous Gladue factors to be considered, including his extensive criminal record, his serious criminal record including 55 prior convictions, his current violent record, and his utterances about white men being rapists and pedophiles. The sentencing judge concluded that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate, given the multiple aggravating factors."

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring.

Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

The Court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and concluded at para that matters in aggravation of damages ought to be pleaded which accounts no doubt for the practice in this jurisdiction of doing so. 2) In assessing general damages, the Court accepted that the plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault and further treatment was required. The plaintiff has some minimal scarring and disfigurement but it is not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damages the court concludes a fair award for general damages is $12,500."

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The applicant applied for an amendment of the judgment. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be reserved on the basis of Column IV of the Tariff of Costs; declined to order solicitor and client costs on the grounds the applicant had always claimed the entire estate but did not have the complete evidence as to all offers made by the parties. The applicant argued the judgment in particular required an amendment since there was no evidence before the Court at trial about substantive offers made either by the applicant or the respondent. HELD: The application for a fixed award of costs was dismissed.  1) The court had an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. 2) The Executions Act states that interest runs from the time of entering judgment and not from that time. 3) The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. 4) It was appropriate to fix the costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000."

Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] Appeal from an order that determined after trial of an issue that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the appellant's pension plan during a series of pre-trial conferences.

The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'.

HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. This is a less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. 2)The failure to give notice to the administrator within the prescribed time gave rise to uncertainty in its application. 3)The delay in receiving the notice did not hamper the appeal. The appeal could only be entertained if it was posted within 20 days of the mailing or publication of the notice. 4)Had the legislature intended nothing of the possible effects of timely posting but untimely receipt of notice by registered mail, this case gives rise to a different set of issues. 5)This is a comparatively narrow context, concerned as it is with the meaning of the word give in virtual isolation, removed from the purpose of the subsection and the objectives of its terms. 6)The question was one of implication having regard to the governing provision of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. 7)It is difficult to think that a proper exercise of the right conferred by the subsection involves a series of series of acts occurring over span of time, beginning with posting, continuing with delivery and ending with receipt. Whether this allows for giving notice by mail is an issue of pure statutory interpretation and therefore depends in short upon what the legislature most probably intended, given the wording, purpose, and objectives of the provisions, and in the light of the scheme of the enactment."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal was allowed, the order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1) There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. 2) The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 3) The appeal must be allowed. There is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even though the judge had not read the criminal record, she was aware of its existence as her decision dated December 17, 2001 indicated. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too mild to be considered by the judge, a mistrial may be declared."

It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The respondent SGI terminated the respondent's income replacement benefits pursuant to s. 197 of the Act. The applicant applied for an order setting aside the termination of the benefits. HELD: 1) The termination was appropriate. The respondent was not entitled to terminate the benefits because the respondent was a farmer. 2) The respondent's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the applicant prior to October 1 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefit as at September 24 were significant factors that contributed to the Applicant's desperate circumstances in October and thereafter.  3) The Court was not prepared to find that the respondent caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. The termination of benefits was set aside."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Issue | Issue [SUMMARY] The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury awarded the plaintiff damages in lieu of proper notice in addition to the claim for failure to give reasonable notice of termination for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of termination. HELD: The plaintiff's holiday pay was calculated on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance was actually part of his salary. Any debt for the April 1990 to March 1991 holidays would have arisen within the statutory period of six years. 1)It would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the same basis as his wage, plus one-half of the truck allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the defendant will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. The defendant agreed to trial with the plaintiff on the issue of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff indicated that the $250.00 portion of the Truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. 3)The Court reviewed the Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service Ltd. (1999), 177 Sask. R. 197 and found that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday pay for 10 years. It would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right. 4)The court reviewed the LSA and found holiday pay should not be based on a wage and truck allowance as it was not designated as an allowance to avoid taxation. The definition of 'wages' does not include an expense allowance and the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in the winter. 5)The defendant argued that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay by his conduct over the years. The LSA only allows recovery of money under contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason [SUMMARY] The applicants applied for relief under s. 300 of the Criminal Code, which constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter. HELD: The relief was granted. 1)The impugned section of the code constitutes a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 2)The Court must balance the value of freedom of expression against the worth of reputation. The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by the Code, not only the expressions involved. 3)Section 301 of the Code constitutes a limitation of the right of expression which is of no force or effect. 4)There is no violation of s. 11(c) or s. 612 of the Criminal Code. 5)A plea of justification consisting of 17 typed pages which, for the purposes of this application, need not be reproduced. 6)Section 298, 299 and 300 are very broad. If the Crown fails to prove that the matter was false, the accused need not prove it was for the pubic benefit or that it was designed to offend the officer. 7)The principles of freedom, especially of the presumption of innocence, are at play in this case. 8)Defamatory libel is a matter published without lawful justification or excuse that is likely to injure the reputation of a police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that is designed to insult the person whom it defames or by any other person. 9)It is unconscionable to deprive a person of their right to express his or her opinion in a constructive manner. 10)Saskatchewan did not meet the threshold test set out in Oakes v. Oakes. 11)The court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge."

Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The respondent issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The information sworn in support of the application for the quashing of the warrant failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe the items sought to be seized would be found at the location to be the subject of the search. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, reasonable latitude must be granted when the wording of the Information is being considered: see Re Time Square Book Store and The Queen, supra, at p. 512 and Re Lubell & The Queen at p 190. 2)Technical compliance with s. 443 is sufficient. Informations are prepared by peace officers who are not trained as legal draftsmen and they often have to prepare the Informations under time constraints, faced with possibility that evidence will disappear if they do not act quickly to seize it.  3)The Information was also deficient in the sole ground upon which it was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in supporting of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. Furthermore the informant failed to pledge on oath as to his belief in the accuracy of the source of confidential information, and therefore no reliance could have been placed thereon by the Respondent in determining whether reasonable and possible grounds existed for the issuance of the Warrant."

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners.

The respondent appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgment interest.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property.

The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

He was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. The accused appealed the decision of the Romanian Court of Appeal which increased his sentence to three years imprisonment and converted it to a non-custodial sentence. He also submitted that his s. 43 submissions to the Minister were not frivolous.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment. 1)The Court found that the Court was unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination. The Court awarded the plaintiff $55,000 in lieu of costs.  2)It was apparent that the defendant bore the burden of demonstrating there was a genuine need for trial. It was not clear that the plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. 3)Gusting is not exactly unusual in a work place and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the Court calculated the plaintiff's damages in the manner set out in the Rule 488(a) and (b). 4)The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavit material filed, but rather, whether despite the contradictory evidence, the issue(s) can be decided in the absent of a cross- examination and it would not otherwise be unjust to do so. 5)The plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary.  6)It seems that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship.

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.",[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years. 1) The defendant had no criminal record and was serving the useful social purpose of looking after his ailing mother who lives on an isolated acreage and who will also be punished if he is incarcerated. 2) There was no evidence that the defendant would harm the community if one were imposed. A conditional sentence would not be a fit sentence given the defendant's record and the limited information available about his ability to communicate with others who might be inclined to engage in the activity ofdistributing child pornography.

The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v.

In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent.

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The defence called four witnesses, and the accused was found not guilty of the charge. HELD: The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the defendant's vehicle constituted careless driving. The Court reviewed four areas where there was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by the Crown and defence. 1) The Court accepted that the accused rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. This is understandable given the speed at which he drove and his driving forward into the defendant. The officer did not swear at the accused and did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the Kuchar. As the accused had stated in his evidence that his vehicle was not going very fast when it struck the plaintiff, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him, and therefore he did not have a due diligence defence including 'taking all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event'. The Court also accepted that neither seat belt, belonging to the accused or the driver, locked upon striking the plaintiff. The vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking him. 2) On a balance of probabilities, the accused drove within the range of what is considered reasonable care. The offence against him was in effect careless driving as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code."

Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused was observed by police driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia, at the time his driver's license was revoked. At trial, the Court found that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive a motor vehicle on the highway. The defence argued that it was not that simple. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the motor vehicle, because it was a prohibited vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license. The Court also dismissed the defence's argument that the word motor vehicle is used within the sections of the Motor Vehicle Act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The court refused to issue the small claims summons. The issue was whether or not the claims should be issued. The applicant had submitted 18 claims submitted in response to a letter from the defendant. Over 2 months later, the defendant responded to the Interim Ruling by responding to the final decision of the trial judge. The defendant had in his claim only averred that four cartons of cigarettes were purchased. The judge reviewed the claim when he was absent from the court on my holiday and found that he did not understand the basic principles and procedures of Small Claims Court. He declined to issue a summons. HELD: The issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature and outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. There is no claim being advanced against any potential defendant other than the Government of Saskatchewan, let alone the other named Defendants. The court has a duty to protect and serve the interests of its clients. The issues to be decided are with respect to the purported existence of a trust relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. There was no negligence on the part of the defendant in bringing this action. The parties will appear at a pre-hearing conference to determine if a resolution can be achieved outside the Court room.

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic.

HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. The respondent denied coverage and refused to defend the action on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. The chambers judge found that Royal was not obligated to defend. The issue to be resolved was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the policy. When the provisions of the policy are 'ambiguous' or 'clearly' do not provide coverage, the insurer has no obligation to defend on behalf of the insured. 2)The chambers judge did not raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by the insurance company was off target. Rather, he raised the possibility that the policy might provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleaders. 3)The Court found that the second stage of the inquiry, the inquiry as to coverage provided by the policy, required a complete analysis of the applicability of any relevant exclusion or definition provision in the insurance policy. 4)This Court was in as good a position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c). 5)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(3) of the Act. However, the test is merely one that if it can be shown that the claim arguably falls within the coverage of a policy, but is not determinative of the right of an insured to be indemnified under policy, the Court concludes that the duty is unambiguously restricted to claims for damages which fall within the scope of the coverage policy."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact were supported by the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault. The evidence did not appear to have been drawn to the attention of the appellate court at the time of trial. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the appellant had intentionally drove in a manner which created a danger to the complainant and to her, and that she did not consent to the application of force.

The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable.

The defendant submitted an invoice to the plaintiff for any costs associated with the conditions of the contract. Judgment was issue accordingly. The reason the amount left blank in the contract was because neither of them were sure what it should be (the plaintiff had not set the price but he had heard some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he felt he could not charge that much); no bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-2006 year (the parties conducted their business together according to the terms of the October 20, 2004 agreement) with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to 60 cents per day per cow; the bonus to be paid for each live calf brought to the defendant's pastures was left blank."

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because it was based entirely on the failure of the parents to live up to their commitments and that the Court did not inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.

The Court noted that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-right holders to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into the exercise thereof, nor interfere with it, with the Court’s reasons."

Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation.

There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of.

There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to a construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge caused as a result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit.

The issue before the Chambers judge was to determine whether the defendant had filed material which established prima facie claim against the City and whether there was any prejudice to the plaintiff if the third party claim was grafted onto the plaintiff’s action.  2)Having reviewed all of the pleadings, it was concluded that the plaintiff had not established a causal connection with the causes of the action raised by the defendant.  3)The application was purely one of procedure and no substantive rights between the parties could be determined on the combined process as an alternative.  4)Hence the application was granted."

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant and the evidence ought to be excluded. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible. It did not violate the accused's s.8 Charter rights. 2)The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s.271(1) of the Criminal Code. That the investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. 3)There was no evidence of bad faith. The intercept evidence was non-conscriptive evidence and was properly admitted by the trial judge. 4)Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered to be non-consecutive evidence. 5)The accused argued that the evidence should be excluded because the breach was inadvertent and the result of unmindful draftsmanship. 6)The Court reviewed the provisions of R. v. Stillman, [1990] and found that there was no Charter breach. 7)There is no evidence to suggest or from which it could be inferred that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences are not eligible for intercept authorizations, such an intention amounts to pure speculation and falls short of what could be considered reasonable grounds to believe information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought."
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest to bring this application. The Court found that access to the petitioner was not in the best interests of the child. The petitioner had a previous relationship with a stepfather, who had been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for sexual assault. The child had a father who lived with the petitioner and her mother. The respondent did not meet the child's biological father and there was no evidence that he would be more successful in harmonizing the complex relationships between his and the petitioner's two daughters."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The Court found that the accused had acted in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. It was not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. The Court distinguished between the subjective and objective perceptions of the accused and concluded that bodily harm to the victim was objectively foreseeable as a result of his actions. The accused was not a 'joint principal offender' as defined in R. v. Hebert, [1996] S.C.R. 321 (Ontario)."

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","[STRUCTURE] Conclusion | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court found that the lender was entitled to apply the realized security proceeds to the purchase money portion of the debt and to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants.  2) The Court found that s. 25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for a mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland.  3) The sale proceeds should be applied against the mortgage balance, but not to purchase money or non-purchase money portions. The Court held that the proceeds of sale must be distributed liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to both purchase money and nonpurch money balances. 4) The decision in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hrynewich Holdings should guide the disposition of this appeal. 5) The appeal was allowed with respect to the amount and proper amount of the deficiency judgment. The court distinguished between the two decisions respecting the Limitations of Civil rights Act (LCRA) and the one respecting the land contracts (Actions) Act (LCCRA). 6) The appellant appealed the decision and sought a determination as to the extent to which s.25 of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act protects an individual from being personally liable on any deficiency claims until economic conditions improved."

Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land. The petitioner may apply for judgment for the amount of the loan secured by the van in her possession if the respondent fails to pay off the loan. 7)Each was to pay his or her own costs.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] HELD: The petitioner was awarded judgment against the respondent for $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.19 and that the judgment shall be a charge on the respondent's personal land. The issue of divorce, custody and access was disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. 1)The petitioner's income from her employment as a restaurant server was reduced by $400.00 per month and the respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and C-ll. The respondent's income was $2,200.00 less the value of the assets in her possession and less half the costs of the appraisals. 2)The respondent was awarded spousal support of $1,278.50 less the $25,000 ordered by the estate. 3)The court declined to order any additional support as the petitioner's assets were in excess of $31,000.00. The court ordered the respondent to pay $300 per month as child support. 4)Spousal and other support of a specified amount was ordered in the amount of $40,000 to be paid to the petitioner in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines. 5)Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) the income of the respondent and that of the petitioner will be nearly the same, it was agreed that the respondent would be in loco parentis in respect of Randy."
8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Non_IRC | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The defendant brought an action claiming reimbursement of monies advanced to the plaintiff and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities required because of the failure of the plaintiff to perform under the contract. The plaintiff counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses caused by the defendant's unjustified termination of the contract and as extras, and for which it has never been paid. Although the equipment used by the plaintiff was not the same type and model of equipment as it listed in the response to the tender, no objection was taken with respect to the equipment delivered to the site. The contractual obligation to maintain the banks, ditches, railway tracks and roadways was to be construed by the wording in the contract as being the contract between the parties, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tenders and the March 1986 invitation for tender was inconsequential."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",[STRUCTURE] Non_IRC | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The mother was the primary care parent and the father was to have access supervised. The father had not seen the mother since January 2010 and was not able to leave the child. The mother also alleged that the father had threatened her with removal of the child from Nova Scotia and that she was in danger of physical harm if she were left in his care. Joint custody with respect to access was ordered to be conducted in six weeks intervals. The evidence before the court was that the Father was an abuser of marijuana and would be at a risk of harm if he left the child with his parents. HELD: The Court found that the evidence did not support the idea that the Court could categorize the violence that occurred between the parties during the incident and the other unpleasant events in their relationship as domestic violence requiring the Father's access to be supervised.
e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Non_IRC | Reason [SUMMARY] FIAT: The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that she had demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown and hadcontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. The Crown sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)The credibility test is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the statement meets the threshold of reliability. 2)The statement was improperly obtained in breach of the Confession Rules of voluntariness. 3)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 4)The witness's prior statement was simply encouraged her to make a statement she was otherwise inclined to make. The fact that her motivation to do so was to help herself is a factor to be taken into consideration. 5)The evidence of the cooperator was not sufficient to introduce the statement for the substantive truth of its witnesses. The credibility test was satisfied by the admission of the witness's voluntary responses to questions posed by her lawyer, city police officer, and prosecutor. 6)The reliability test was met in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C.C.(3d)285. 7)The Crown was not able to establish that the witness was acting in a hostile and hostile manner at the time of her arrest, nor could it establish that her voluntary responses were likely to affect the credibility of her witnesses."

There was no palpable and overriding error in the facts as determined by the court. The decision was also dismissed with respect to the amount of notice given. The five month notice period was reduced to 15 months from the date of the appeal.

The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","[STRUCTURE] Issue | Issue | Conclusion | Reason | Reason [SUMMARY] The Government of Saskatchewan applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.
