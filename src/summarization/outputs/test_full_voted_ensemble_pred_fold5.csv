If the three years for making such an application expires without an application being made, the limitation period begins to run again.

The limitation period for the commencement of an action to enforce the respondent’s mortgage has expired and the registration of the mortgage is ordered discharged.","The applicant asks that the registration of mortgage against land be discharged on the basis that the limitation period to enforce the mortgage has expired because The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c.

HELD: The notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again and promptly thereafter expired.

This absurd result would not flow just to the respondent in its unique circumstances. Acceptance of the respondent's interpretation of the Farm security Act would lead to a situation where any and all mortgagees could entirely avoid any limitation period applying to their mortgage by the simple devise of serving notice of intention under the Act.","[34] It is my conclusion that the notice of extension having expired on February 28, 2009, the limitation clock began to run again.

The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness.

The trial judge did not err in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 2)The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, decided to allow the appellant's appeal and order a new trial.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code.

Rather, it is quite clear, based on the evidence as a whole - including the appellant\'s admissions as to when he drove to the grid road - that the appellant had care and control, not more than approximately ten minutes before he was first approached by the police. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed.",0.38174273858921165,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction pursuant to Criminal Code s. 813. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. 1) The facts are unremarkable. It's tortured progress through the Canadian criminal justice system makes it much more remarkable than the facts. 2) The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could not have been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the appellant described. 3) The accused rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 4) The trial judge did not err in finding that the appellant had de facto care or control of the vehicle. Rather, he adopted the reasoning of Green P.C.J. at the second trial, which included finding the appellant was planning on resting and sleeping for a number of hours before driving to Manitoba, and did not occupy the driver's seat for the purpose of setting his vehicle in motion. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, stayed the proceedings.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code. The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could have not been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described. [16] In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge’s reasons disclose that he applied the wrong legal test as to de facto care and control. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests.

The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed. Accordingly, the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial judge’s error of law. [30] That said, it is my view that the trial judge’s reasons do not disclose an error within the meaning of the third part of the test outlined in Morrissey.  That is, they do not disclose that the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue which played an essential part in the reasoning process which resulted in the conviction. This unrepresented accused was given a very strong message by the learned trial judge that there was no point in leading evidence in an attempt to challenge the accuracy of the Intoxylizer results. Further, and although the learned trial judge initially referred to the fact that the appellant could prove either equipment malfunction or operator error, his comments, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the only expert evidence that would have been relevant would be evidence relating to equipment malfunction. [51] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to hold the appellant responsible for the failure to press the issue of operator error, or to refuse relief because he did not do so. [52] In the result, it is my respectful opinion that the trial judge’s comments compromised trial fairness, thereby resulting in an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is accordingly granted on this ground. [56] However, this is not a case where the alleged Charter breach was first raised on appeal. In the result, the appeal should be allowed on this ground as well. [73] In this case, it is my view that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested or aggravated if the appellant is tried a fourth time. [76] To the extent that there is any doubt remaining, it is also my view that the balancing of interests called for by the third test confirms that this is one of those “clearest of cases” which call for a stay of proceedings. [77] The appeal is allowed, and it is hereby ordered that the proceedings against the appellant are stayed. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests.

The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.

Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The Students' Union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act pursuant to s. 222(d) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.

The court found that the students' Union was a 'proper person' to bring the application and that it had no standing to bring it. The Chambers judge made no errors in his approach to the application.  1) It is not necessary to work through the merits of these arguments because, regardless of how they might play out, the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by Mr. Mowat and others about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. The Court found that there was an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice rules. 2) The Court concluded that the appeals must be dismissed. It is entirely satisfied that the student’s representative was a proper person to bring this application. He was active in the referendum campaign and a leading voice against joining the Federation and was a member of the Students’ Union both at the time of the referendum and during the time the actions about which he complained took place.

The fact that his application was ultimately argued a few months after he had convocated should not, in my view, defeat his right to bring his concerns forward.

The trial judge grappled with the substance of the issues presented at the trial which were whether the accused had been assaulted by the complainant, whether the accused reasonably believed that he was being assaulted and whether his response was proportionate. The trial judge based his conclusions on the whole of the evidence rather than preferring the evidence of one witness over another. An appellate court is not entitled to overturn a verdict simply because the trial judge placed more weight on some portions of the record than others.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Court granted leave and allowed the appeal in judgment from the bench. HELD: The conviction was upheld and the appeal was allowed. 1) The Court reviewed the evidence of the three witnesses and determined that the trial judge had misinterpreted the accused's reasons and exceeded the bounds of appellate review. 2) The trial judge did not err in his reasons. He did not direct himself on all of the relevant evidence resulting in a reviewable error. He focused on the fact there were two officers present. 3) The court found that even if the accused’s mistake of fact had been reasonable, he would have rejected the defence of self-defence on the basis that the use of pepper spray was not proportionate response. 4) An appellate court must re-examine and to some extent reweigh the evidence and its effect, but must not simply substitute its view of the evidence for that of the judge. The court also found that the failure on the part of trial judge to find Cst. Lariviere to be reasonable was not an unreasonable finding. 5) It was not necessary to draw comparisons with what a reasonable person might believe with respect to the extent and imminence of the danger by which he was threatened, and the force necessary to defend himself against the apprehended danger. 6) There was no inconsistency in the trial decision.","Disposition: Allowed (orally) [2] The Crown applied for leave to appeal pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tribunal found that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place; the tribunal also found that it was not responsible for the discrimination against the applicant. The applicant had been a casual employee for 16 years and had been employed by the City for 15 years. He had received 4% less in wages than other city employees because of his disability; the court also compensated the applicant in the amount of $8,902.00.","[1] This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the “City”) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (“CUPE”) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J.

The plaintiffs brought a claim in contract and tort alleging Hagblom caused a fire in their building. The third party claim alleged negligence by the city's fire department in managing the fire and in the post-fire investigation. The third parties argued that, subject to their duty to act in good faith, they could not be found liable to the defendants in negligence. In issue was whether s.136.1(2) of the Urban Municipality Act and s.34 of the Fire Prevention Act prevented the defendants from taking proceedings against the third parties; whether certain paragraphs should be struck on the basis the common law does not recognize a cause of action for spoiled or destroyed evidence and failure to assist in gathering evidence on the basis the third parties did not owe a statutory duty to the defendants; whether certain paragraphs should be struck as the defendants had not obtained leave to bring third party proceedings as required by s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act.

It is arguable on the pleadings that the fire department failed to properly fight the fire, and that they omitted certain actions prior to the fire that supposedly contributed to its spread. 4) The essence of the claim is that every allegation of fact in the Statement of Claim is true, even if it appears to be very unlikely allegation that will be difficult to prove.

At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs.

(""Standard"") and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited (""Hyndman"") with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. [10] It is clear, however, from Cox’s notes and Duda’s evidence at the trial that, (a) Hyndman would not assume the obligations on the Redhead and Standard leases, and (b) that Redhead knew at that meeting that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard’s insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases. Contract [12] On the evidence as a whole it is apparent that there was no contractual relationship between the parties, Redhead and Hyndman, with respect to the lease payments. [14] The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to the leases is therefore dismissed. [17] The facts of this case, however, do not satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that this is an appropriate circumstance for an award in favour of the plaintiff based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. [19] The plaintiff’s claim on this ground is also dismissed. On the issue of the unpaid invoices, the plaintiff\'s evidence does not establish that Hyndman had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from Hyndman authorizing the repairs. In fact the evidence indicates that Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number once they realized there may have been a misapprehension by Standard’s creditors with respect to the payment of these accounts. [22] I therefore find that the plaintiff\'s claim with respect to the unpaid repairs against Hyndman has not been proven and that portion of the claim is also dismissed. [24] There being no defence entered to the claim by Redhead against Standard and the defendant, Standard, having been noted for default, judgment is therefore given against them in the amount of the plaintiff\'s claim for:

(a) damages for breach of contract for the outstanding lease payments and the outstanding parts and service account in the total amount of $63,267.49;

(b) pre-judgment interest to be calculated from March 28, 1994, to the date of judgment pursuant to The Pre-Judgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P-22.2;

(""Standard"") and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited (""Hyndman"") with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to these leased vehicles. [10] It is clear, however, from Cox’s notes and Duda’s evidence at the trial that, (a) Hyndman would not assume the obligations on the Redhead and Standard leases, and (b) that Redhead knew at that meeting that there was a risk to the arrangement because of Standard’s insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on the leases. Contract [12] On the evidence as a whole it is apparent that there was no contractual relationship between the parties, Redhead and Hyndman, with respect to the lease payments. [14] The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant, Hyndman, with respect to the leases is therefore dismissed.

On the issue of the unpaid invoices, the plaintiff\'s evidence does not establish that Hyndman had notice of the invoices, or that there was a purchase order number obtained from Hyndman authorizing the repairs.

(c) costs of this action.",0.48154657293497366,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Standard did not enter a defence to Redhead's claim and had been noted in default. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment. The actions taken were for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number.","This is an action by Redhead Equipment against Standard Transportation Services and Hyndman Transport (1972) Limited with respect to amounts owing for payments on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by the plaintiff to these leased vehicles.

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the father's total income to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983. In 2003, the total amount of child maintenance was $5,000. In 2004, the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the father in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges portion of the vehicle is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as personal use should be 50 percent. Evidence was led that the father used the vehicle to efficiently combine personal and business use whenever he could. In looking at the last three years in total, the truck cost was listed at $23,283 with depreciation taken of $18,855 to date. The father testified that he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement. This along with significant personal use makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost of allowance claimed in each of the years in question which will result in an addition to income in 2003 of $2,882; in 2004, $3,829; in 2005, $1,733; and in 2006, $4,733. The Court awarded the petitioner mother $24,300. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is a three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father’s personal farming statement. Each party achieved partial success in their approach to the issue of maintenance. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable.","(a) The respondent’s income is determined to be $29,983, and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar Knudson, born December 18, 1998, and Bronwyn Knudson and Kadence Knudson, both born August 9, 2000, the sum of $568.00 per month commencing October 1, 2005, and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), provided that if he has overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50.00 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished.",0.22382671480144406,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.

The court determined that the respondent would be far worse off if the agreement was set aside and an equal division ordered.","A divorce and matrimonial property hearing was held. The parties were married in 1960 and separated in 1989. They had two children, aged 18 and 19 years of age. At the conclusion of the hearing and oral argument, the parties agreed that there was no possibility of reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing.

This would require, an examination of the injuries and how they are sustained. Such an examination would cause repetition of this costly expert testimony and if not properly considered would be prejudicial to the plaintiffs.",0.4971428571428571

Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The parties were married in 1993 and had two children, aged 12 and 7. They separated in March 2007 and were divorced in March 2008. The Corollary Relief Judgment incorporated an agreement that the parties would share joint custody of the children, with the mother to have relatively equal time with the children and each would contribute financially to the child support application. In 2006, the mother applied to vary child support based on the father's increased income and a decline in the mother's income. She also asked the court to review the amount of child support paid by the father going back to when the parties first separated and to consider a variation of the last variation order. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court was not prepared to retroactively vary the terms of that order or change the formula used by the parties and asked that it be adjusted accordingly.","The former wife now seeks to again increase the level of child support based on the former husband’s increased income and a decline in her income.

Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts. It was unnecessary to decide the constitutional issue.","The accused was charged with seven counts, including the following: without lawful authority, angle in Saskatchewan waters without a licence to wit: angle on Waterbury Lake, contrary to s. 11(1) of the Fisheries Regulations, and without lawful authorization, possess fish except in accordance with any licence or any provision of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan), 1994 or the Canada Act (Canada), contrary to ss. 13(1), and 9(1). The Crown has conceded that the accused is not a member of the Executive Council. HELD: The accused was dismissed. 1)There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of s. 27. The prohibition is not valid on its face as being without authority. 2)The accused did possess a fishing licence. He acted in compliance with that licence. There was no valid section 27 revocation or prohibition in place so as to invalidate his licence.","[1] Jason Paulsen stands charged with seven counts on a single information, including the following: Count 1.

Without lawful authority apply for or obtain a licence while disqualified or prohibited, contrary to section 9 of The Fisheries Regulations F-16.1 Reg 1 To put it another way, the issue is this: was there a valid ministerial order revoking Mr. Paulsen’s licence and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times? Section 27 does not give the minister the power to revoke when a person contravenes The Fisheries Regulations. The Crown has conceded that Kevin Callele is not a member of the Executive Council.

HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother.

The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price to be paid for goods and services. The amount sought was unreasonable. 2) The defendant properly pointed out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared and that it had, therefore, incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 3) There was no evidence as to how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred.

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded the sum of $10,902.32. 1)The court accepted that the law demands, in the absence of an express term in a contract, an implied term to be used to describe the price paid for goods, or services, or alternatively, a fair price for those goods and/or services be imported into that agreement. 2)The amount of the plaintiff’s travel to and from Grasswood (a round trip distance of 500 kilometers) at per kilometer rate of $.42 for each of the two occasions that it was required to attend was $8,614.17. 3)The plaintiff was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. 4)Costs were not included in the calculation of the amount of damages awarded. 5)The Court accepted that in ascertaining what might constitute a fair, reasonable price to pay for goods and service, the parties’ dealings must have been based on mutual assumption of fact or law, created by statement, conduct, or implied by silence whereby one party has conducted itself (or acted) in reliance on that shared assumption so as to change its legal positions. In so doing, the party has suffered detriment, such that it would be unfair or unjust to allow one of the parties to resile or depart from the common assumption.","The Law [7] I accept that the law demands, that in the absence of an express term in a contract which stipulates a price to be paid for goods, or services, or both, an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price for those goods and/or services be imported into that agreement. [12] Before discussing the accounting that is necessary, I wish to deal with the plaintiff’s argument regarding estoppel by convention. While I appreciate plaintiff counsel’s clear and cogent legal analysis of this area of law, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has provided a sufficient evidentiary foundation upon which that legal argument can be predicated [20] Even if this evidence had been led, I would still have reservations in accepting this argument, because I have heard no convincing evidence of detriment reliance. That is to say, I did not hear any representative of the plaintiff assert that the plaintiff had the opportunity to seek more lucrative work, but declined to accept that more lucrative work, in reasonable reliance of an understanding that the defendant would pay the amount of money that it was seeking on the terms that it thought existed under the agreement. [21] Because I cannot, on the evidence, identify the express terms of the contract stipulating the price to be paid for the various goods and services that were provided, I am obligated to import an implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge, and pay, a fair and reasonable price. [28] I find that a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equates to the sum of $10,902.32. am prepared to award the cost of the expert’s travel to and from Grasswood (a round trip distance of 500 kilometers) at per kilometer rate of $.42 for each of the two occasions that he was required to attend.",0.6219839142091151,"Reliable Truck Trailer, a mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company, entered into an oral agreement with the defendant in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for the defendant's fleet of trucks.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. The parties were parents of three children, ages 8, 9 and 10. The respondent requested an increase in the basic child support payment, including retroactive child support, and determination of the eligible expenses and proportionate share of s.7 expenses. The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in failing to take into account the total costs of the children's extracurricular activities, which were ordinary expenses and thus included in the table amount fixed by s.3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed
 [18] The Chambers judge had the necessary evidence before him that he is required to consider to make his decision whether all, some, or none of the expenses are extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs of the appeal to the respondent.

(in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v.

The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application.

The food services operators, alleging a denial of natural justice and procedural fairness, sought to have the orders set aside on the grounds the decisions were patently unreasonable in that the employer could not afford the wage increases and because retroactivity would not have been a feature of a replicated contract. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)In undertaking to replicate a collective bargaining agreement that the parties might have reached, the LRB concluded the contract in 14 months by which time the two year term contract had only three and one-half months to go. The two year contract has now expired and the business has been sold. To elevate this issue to a point where a rehearing would be required would seem counterproductive. 2)The LRB's actions fell well short of substantial compliance with the 45 day limit for review. However at no time was the 'over 45 days' issue raised in the proceedings before the Board. The test of 'substantial compliance' would involve a consideration of the purpose of the 45 day time limit and the probability of prejudice which might arise from a failure to comply. The importance of a retroactive wage increase, which was substantial if viewed as a percentage, would seem prejudicial, even accepting the 45 day limit is directory. The employer sought and obtained an adjournment of the hearing in April which effectively made compliance with the 45 day limit impossible as the employees left once they graduated from their university courses. 3)The errors were not so severe or so obvious as to meet the standard of patently unreasonable as defined by the courts (ie. clearly irrational (Federal Court of Appeal), outrageous, absurd, ridiculous, so beyond the bound of reason as to amount to fraud on the law or deliberate refusal to comply with it (Southam)). 4)The decision to allow employees, who had graduated and left their employment to receive back pay, was not of sufficient import to justify a finding of breach of natural justice. Whether the Board breached natural justice and procedural fairness by awarding retroactive wages depends on whether the issue was one of the points of dispute between the parties.

b_2004skqb156.txt,"The appellant appeals the calculation of his income replacement benefit made by the respondent, SGI, as provided by Part VIII of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. Under s. 198 of the Act, a hearing was held to determine certain facts. The parties agree the appellant was a non-earner as defined by the Act, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered injuries to an extent that he is not able to carry on gainful employment as a skidder operator. The appellant estimated that he should receive an income replacement benefit (IRB) based on yearly wages in excess of $50,000. This position was based on employment promised to the appellant that would have started during the first 180 days following the accident. The respondent submits that the weighted average approach sets the IRB much lower, as in the previous 3 years the appellant earned no more than $12,000 per year. HELD: 1) The IRB must reflect a claimant's earning reality. The appellant's earning reality was far from the promised employment. The Court found that the appellant's earning reality was working for employment income no more than half the time and the IRB ought to be calculated accordingly.  2) The benefits referred to in s. 20 of the Regulations include employment bonuses, tips, overtime, and personal use of a motor vehicle.

Counsel for SGI submitted that the weighted average approach in calculating the respondent's gross yearly employment income sets the IRB much lower than that of the appellant's. HELD: The appellant is entitled to solicitor-client costs.  1)The respondent stands for just this proposition. But, in that case, the court was required to make a determination whether the claimant was deprived of an employment insurance benefit in the first 180 days. This position is based on employment promised to the appellant which would have commenced during the first 90 days. If the appellant was entitled to benefits other than what SGI has paid him, he is awarded interest on the value of those benefits not paid, from June 1, 2001 to date. SGI did not receive information from the appellant regarding promised employment until that date, where the income is annualized, indexed and adjusted pursuant to s28.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The parties married in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 3, 2004. The parenting and support issues concerning Ella have been resolved. The respondent was the biological child of the parties. The issue for the Court was whether Tristen is a 'child of the marriage' as defined by the Divorce Act (and if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). The respondent asserts that the child is “child of a marriage” and seeks child support for him from Delorey. HELD: 1)The threshold for parental status finding must be pegged at a sufficiently high point that it avoids the imposition of obligations and the acquisition of access and custody rights except where the step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent and in substantial substitution for that natural parent's role. In this case, the respondent is the parent of Ella. 2)The respondent's evidence contradicted the assertion that the natural mother did not take any, or at least any significant, part in the children's lives.","[4] The issue for the Court at this time is whether Tristen is a ""child of the marriage"" (of Ms. Callahan and Mr. Delorey) as defined by the Divorce Act (and, if so, what his obligation to pay child support should be). This was an important decision - Mr. Delorey did not “stand in the place of a parent” when this decision was made. [24] I agree with the view expressed by Justice Campbell of this Court - in Cook - that the threshold for a finding of parental status is high and reserved for these cases where a step-parent can be clearly shown to have assumed the role of the natural parent in substantial substitution of the role of a natural parent. I conclude that Mr. Delorey was generous and concerned in his support and caring for and of Tristen ‑ but that he did so at the time of his separation from Ms. Callahan, as a person in addition to, not in the place of, a parent.

While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him.

The bank's indebtedness secured by its mortgage far exceeded the purchase price. The registered owner had taken no opposition. No other interests will be adversely affected. 3)The reservations expressed in the Clarkson case did not exist or apply to the circumstances here but others having similar interests in future were cautioned to consider the direction of the Court of Appeal at para of its Clarkson judgment.","FIAT.

The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task.

[77] Accordingly, I find Viterra not guilty on all six counts.",0.5841392649903289,"HELD: The court did not accept the Crown’s position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proved the actus reus of failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee. The deceased witness’s evidence was not relied upon by the court due to inconsistencies. The assistant manager’s evidence also had some inconsistencies but overall his oral testifying was found to be in a frank and honest manner. The court accepted the assistant manager’s evidence that he would not have told the employee or anyone to go down into the pit to clear a blockage, because it is not possible to clear such a blockage from inside the pit. The Crown argued that, in any event, the court should infer that because the employee entered the pit, the respondent did not adequately instruct, train, supervise and inform him. The court found that the mass of training material emphasized the dangers and the importance of following the safety procedures. The information was not buried in a mass of other information as suggested by the Crown. The court found that the information, training, instruction and supervision was sufficient, if adhered to, to ensure the health and safety of the employee, generally. The Crown argued that a culture of paying lip service to safety had developed at the respondent’s place of business. The court held that, despite some lapses in safety, overall there was a culture of safety. The court also held that the respondent did not instruct the employee to unplug a blockage in the pit and, therefore, did not have an obligation to instruct him on how to perform that task. The respondent was not guilty of counts 1 and 2. The Crown also did not prove the actus reus of counts 3 and 4. The Crown failed to prove that the respondent did not adequately train and supervise the employee with respect to responding to a blockage by looking into the receiving pit to see if it was full of grain. The court also concluded that the respondent had made the employee aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in a receiving pit and, therefore, the actus reus of counts 5 and 6 were not proved. The court noted that if the actus reus had been proven with respect to any count, the court would have, nonetheless, concluded that the respondent exercised due diligence.","The accused was charged under the Canada Labour Code with failing to ensure the health and safety of an employee by failing to instruct him on how to unplug a receiving pit and failing to provide proper training and supervision to ensure that the employee was made aware of the hazard of being engulfed in grain in receiving pit. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The mass of material emphasized the dangers, and the importance of following the safety procedures, rather than burying them. The Court of Appeal's approval of these remarks did not accept the Crown's position that proof of a worker injury or death necessarily proves the actus reus of failing to protect an employee. 2) Viterra is not charged with only the general allegation that it failed to ensure safety at work; rather, counts and allege the manner in which the company failed to instruct and supervise the employee. The accused is found guilty of committing an offence contrary to s. 148(1) of the Code. 3) The evidence of the deceased was found to be buried in hundreds of power point slides.

The court's decision is not anticipatory in nature. 8)The applicants were awarded taxable costs of the application fixed at $400.","FIAT: Pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1), the applicants seek an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre. HELD: 1)The applicants are hoteliers who operate five of the six hotels and motels within the community and who have joined together in an informal association.

(a) Were the respondent’s proceedings in respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, invalid by reason of bad faith?

(b) Has the respondent met the statutory prerequisites for a public meeting? Both are shareholders and directors of 622659 Saskatchewan Ltd. which owns the River Inn, a hotel located in Nipawin. Taking into account that the individuals are involved in a small, closely held private corporation, I am of the opinion that the individuals fall within the definition of partnership and they are all senior officers of the corporation. [45] In my opinion, both Mr. Day and Mr. Mochoruk had a pecuniary interest in the Palidwar proposal within the meaning of the legislation. In the circumstances the process as a whole is tainted and should be set aside. (1) the Town of Nipawin is prohibited from holding a public hearing on August 30, 1999, in respect to Bylaw 756/99, being a bylaw to amend Bylaw 465/82, the Zoning Bylaw of the Town of Nipawin; (3) the application is dismissed in respect to the application for discretionary use by Kathy and Gary Palidwar; and",0.49023861171366595,"FIAT: Pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664(1), the applicants seek an order prohibiting the respondent from holding a public hearing with respect to a proposed hotel development, including the subject bylaw, and from further considering an application for a discretionary use permit by Kathy and Gary Palidwar for a private hotel development connected with the community facility known as the Evergreen Centre.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck.

The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The respondent appealed the decision to strike the claim. The Court held that, without a challenge to legislation, the Municipality does not create a justiciable issue by referring in the claim to s.36 of the Constitution Act, when the commitments set out in that section do not alter the Legislature's right to exercise legislative authority. A general attack on “government” action, alleging that the Nova Scotia regime is constitutionally deficient, is too vague a basis for a court to determine under s.52 of the Act that law “is inconsistent with the provisions” and “of no force or effect.” The court also held that the respondent’s proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Charter could not be struck summarily because it was not plain and obvious that the claim would fail.","Result: Appeal dismissed. 2.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month. The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence of the child and directed the matter to pre-trial conference.","[266] In the absence of an agreement or court order to the contrary, the petitioner and the respondent are presumed to be joint custodians of their son, D.K. No such agreement exists in this case, and my interim order of August 7, 2014, while providing for interim parenting, did nothing to displace that presumption. [300] The evidence confirms that D.K. is a smart, sometimes sensitive but generally happy child. [304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00. [414] Commencing December 1, 2015 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter, the petitioner shall pay support for the respondent in the amount of $6,000.00, provided however that the said order shall be reviewable at the instance of either party upon the earlier of the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine in Canada, or the 1st day of December 2018. Within 14 days thereafter, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent the sum of $36,850.00, representing her interest in the equity therein.",0.12010443864229764,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines.

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the claim arising from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the financer held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that it became a tenant at sufferance and was obliged to pay rent. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The PPSA does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. It is consistent with the regime established pursuant to it. Section 36 provides only that a person with an interest in land may refuse permission to remove goods until he or she has received adequate security for reimbursement of damages caused by their removal. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture on the property prior to it being constructed, it had changed its position as of September 1, 1999. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town of Prince Albert Land Titles Office. 2)The trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) to (16). The Credit Union took the position that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to allow the removal of the building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes. 3)Gari's claims in this regard must fail.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-Appeal dismissed [1] This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2 (“PPSA”). The claim arises from the Credit Union’s delay in removing from Gari’s land a quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. [2] In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer\'s failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. At the end of December 2000, it applied for an order that removal of the Building be postponed until the Credit Union paid (a) $3,500 as security for reimbursement for possible removal damage; (b) rent of $500 per month from April 1999 through to the date the Building was removed, and (c) $2,818.04 of municipal property taxes for the period April 1999 to December 31, 2000. With respect to the Applicant’s claim for occupation rent and reimbursement of taxes paid over the past year, this portion of the application is dismissed. In my view the evidence falls well short of proving that the plaintiff could have derived any rent from the property, had the building not been there, beyond the amount that the plaintiff actually recovered.

There was no dispute that the lights were on when the defendant vehicle turned left in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. The destruction prevented the plaintiffs from examining the headlights. There are two issues with respect to liability for the accident. 1) When the plaintiffs brought a motion for the destruction of the exhibits, the defendant officer testified that he was aware that the plaintiffs vehicle was in the intersection but he did not see it. He did not say that he saw the lights on the defendant's vehicle when he turned the other vehicle around. He stated that he had not noticed the lights at the intersection when he first noticed them. He said he was looking at the vehicle in the parking lot when he observed the vehicle approaching the intersection. He claimed that he could not recall the location of the vehicle at the time. He also claimed that the plaintiff was wearing a seat belt when she was driving. He was not entitled to an opinion on the issue. 2) The evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of a police officer was not admissible. The officer had preformed minimal study on lamp examination and had had no experience in collision analysis because lamp examination is quite distinct from the other subjects referred to in the curriculum vitae. There is no dispute the plaintiff had two White Russians during the course of the night. The only thing that could be drawn from the testimony of the officer was that the defendant had two more White Russians at the same time. 3) The defendant was not qualified to express opinions on the operation or non-operation of the lamps of the plaintiffs' motor vehicle. It could be described as an erroneous act or a negligent act but accept that which the officer stated in his evidence and conclude that the test of expertness so far as the law of evidence is concerned is still in the field in which it is sought to have the witness","[1] This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cathy Hawes and Aulden Pottie, for damages suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 23, 1998 at the intersections of Forrest Hills Drive and Main Street in the Dartmouth area of Halifax Regional Municipality.

Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. The driver suffered soft tissue injuries to her neck and mid and lower back, blunt trauma to both knees and bruising of the right hand. She underwent physiotherapy for three months and made a complete recovery within two years except for flare-ups in the upper back. The second plaintiff suffered neck stiffness, bilateral shoulder pain and bruising to his arm and leg. He underwent successful surgery for tendonitis in both shoulders and his neck improved with physiotherapy. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact.","At the time of the motor vehicle accident, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The defendant's motor vehicle was stopped at a red light. The plaintiffs alleged that the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle referred to herein as the 'police vehicle'. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that Ms. Hawes is contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light and the defendant was operating the police vehicle. There was no dispute that the lights were on when the defendant vehicle turned left in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. The destruction prevented the plaintiffs from examining the headlights. There are two issues with respect to liability for the accident. 1) When the plaintiffs brought a motion for the destruction of the exhibits, the defendant officer testified that he was aware that the plaintiffs vehicle was in the intersection but he did not see it. He did not say that he saw the lights on the defendant's vehicle when he turned the other vehicle around. He stated that he had not noticed the lights at the intersection when he first noticed them. He said he was looking at the vehicle in the parking lot when he observed the vehicle approaching the intersection. He claimed that he could not recall the location of the vehicle at the time. He also claimed that the plaintiff was wearing a seat belt when she was driving. He was not entitled to an opinion on the issue. 2) The evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of a police officer was not admissible. The officer had preformed minimal study on lamp examination and had had no experience in collision analysis because lamp examination is quite distinct from the other subjects referred to in the curriculum vitae. There is no dispute the plaintiff had two White Russians during the course of the night. The only thing that could be drawn from the testimony of the officer was that the defendant had two more White Russians at the same time. 3) The defendant was not qualified to express opinions on the operation or non-operation of the lamps of the plaintiffs' motor vehicle. It could be described as an erroneous act or a negligent act but accept that which the officer stated in his evidence and conclude that the test of expertness so far as the law of evidence is concerned is still in the field in which it is sought to have the witness","[1] This is an action by the plaintiffs, Cathy Hawes and Aulden Pottie, for damages suffered as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred on November 23, 1998 at the intersections of Forrest Hills Drive and Main Street in the Dartmouth area of Halifax Regional Municipality. The plaintiffs allege that the accident occurred as a result of the negligence of the defendant, Peter Yorston, in the operation of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police motor vehicle referred to herein as the “police vehicle”. In proceeding to Lake Echo the plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light. First, the defendants claim the headlights of the Hawes vehicle were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that Ms. Hawes is contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning without turning on the headlights of the vehicle. I permitted further evidence from the witness but I can now state there was not presented evidence which establishes Constable Zildjan was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony. [47] When I consider the evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of Constable Zildjan, if it had been admissible, I find that up to the time of the motor vehicle collision the headlights were in operation on the plaintiff Hawes’ motor vehicle. [59] In conclusion, even if I found the witness qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lamps prior to the accident, his evidence is not probative and lacks consistency to the point where I could not accept his opinion. I would award $12,000 general damages with interest thereon at the rate of 2.5 percent thereon for five years. I would reduce damages by 20 per cent.

2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner $1,945.00 plus an award of costs of $5,000.00. The Court directed that the matrimonial home be divided equally. The petitioner argued that the prior ownership of the home by the parties, which they never lived in, must be distributed equally unless am satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance; or unfair to the spouse who has custody of the children. The court cautioned that the children in this context refers to children of this marriage and not to the five or ten holdovers from Sharon's first marriage.","It was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. [7] Edward Lang is employed by the public school system and has a permanent job. He has the prospect of an inheritance from his mother, a good pension, his own home with no mortgage and in short no financial problems. I am persuaded however, that the prior ownership of the home by Sharon and its occupancy by her many children, the economic imbalance between Edward and Sharon and the brevity of the marriage combine to make this an out of the ordinary or unusual case. The matrimonial home will therefore not be distributed but allowed to remain in Sharon’s name as it was for many years before she met Edward. There is also: (1) an accrual to Edward’s pension during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at $8,358.00; (2) an accrual to his Standard Life contract during the same period in the amount of $1,200.00.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years of age at the time of the accident and had just passed a pedestrian crossing the street. He was driving a light colored Audi that passed him at a high rate of speed. The pedestrian was thrown from the vehicle. The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a sentence in the low end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be served inthe community rather than in a corrections facility.  1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him resulted in tragic consequences. For whatever reason, he failed to exercise his right to be free from alcohol and drugs and drove at speed in excess of 60 km/hr.  2)The court found that incarceration should be limited to 18 months and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate.","The accused, Chad J. D. Delaittre, has plead
guilty to a charge: THAT HE, the said Chad J. D. Delaittre,

motor vehicle on the streets of the City of Regina to

the public, and did hereby cause the death of Vernon
Keith Ward contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal
Code of Canada. Specifically the defence argues that a sentence in the lower
end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such
a sentence should be a conditional sentence to be served in

subsequent convictions of the accused for two speeding
offences. Therefore, in respect to the offence of dangerous
driving causing death, I sentence the accused to be imprisoned
for 90 days in the Provincial Correctional Centre at Regina,

probation order which shall commence after he has served his

Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability.

The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act.

The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The parties to this action have reached an impasse on the required disclosure and seek various orders.

This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence and the defendants could be liable to the accounting firm should it breach that trust. 2) The Court may exercise its discretion only if there is severe prejudice to the moving party as opposed to ordinary prejudice.

The policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of these issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties.  2) The parties have three children. They now have a shared parenting arrangement and the petitioner cohabitates with a woman who is employed full-time but assume for present purposes that she is not at this time a common law partner for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (5th Supp.) as they have not cohabitated in the conjugal relationship for twelve consecutive months. While it may be that parties in a settlement meet reach a consensus on a number of issues, they did not reach agreement on all issues. The circumstance at hand is to be distinguished from an application to enforce settlement agreement where it is alleged that all issues are settled.  3) The respondent brought a motion returnable October 19, 2012 claiming child and Spousal Support together with exclusive possession and child care expenses as the parties may agree upon. In the event they cannot agree, an application may be made in chambers.  4) The last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit A are struck and the Local Registrar is directed to remove Exhibit A from the court file.  5) Once entitlement is determined, the court must be guided by the factors set out in the Divorce Act and the specific facts of the situation at hand.  6) It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions; (iii) Few parties would initiate or participate in",0.530089628681178

At trial, the Plaintiff had been awarded damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Defendant limited her appeal to the amount awarded for future loss of earnings.

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss in an automobile collision, a judge awarded damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent.

The court also ordered that the defendant must provide a copy of the consent order to HRM within two weeks of the issuance of the order and that it would be taxed accordingly. 1)The defendant knew of the Order, its contents and import and the fact that he consented to it. 2)Joudrey conducted himself post granting of the Consent Order in a manner which found as fact he willfully and intentionally sought to avoid the Order. Such a provision is one that will very much foster compliance with this Order. 3)The Court found no other reasonable inference that he clearly intended to circumvent the Order and intended to disobey it.",0.33138401559454195
2_2001nssc171.txt,"A dispute arose between a landlord and a tenant about damage to the premises and whose responsibility it was to repair the damage. The dispute was referred to arbitration as per the terms of the lease. The arbitrator found the tenant liable for the damage and ordered the tenant to pay the landlord specified amounts for repairs and loss of rental opportunity. The tenant made an application for judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Application allowed in part; portions of arbitrator's decision where he accepted estimates of costs of repairs and loss of rental opportunity, awarded damages and applied the equitable principle of estoppel quashed; application dismissed with respect to the rest of arbitrator's decision. The arbitration clause was a limited arbitration clause and the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to award damages or apply the equitable principle of estoppel.

The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid.

The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality.

The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255 and 253 of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court found that the accused's driving irregularities and the physical symptoms painted a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by the alcohol. The absence of the smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption of beverage alcohol did not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia considered in their totality. The Court also found that in the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the motorist had alcohol in his body.  1)On the whole of the observations and information in the possession of the officer, the accused was found to have reasonable ground to effect an arrest for impaired driving and that the grounds for the demand were objectively sustainable. 2)There was no breach of s. 8 or s. 9 of the Charter and the evidence was therefore admissible. 3)The Court held that the admission of the evidence could not be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and therefore, the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to the s. 24(2) Charter.","BACKGROUND [1] On July 14, 2010, Mr. Palmer was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and also with operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. Consequently, the grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and therefore, the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. [21] Clearly, Constable Walz could have asked the accused if he had consumed alcohol, but the weight attached to any response would have been up to the officer; he is not required to accept what he was told and terminate an investigation in the face of a denial or explanation from the accused: [23] It is the view of this Court that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused in this case paint a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. In the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. On the whole of the observations and information in the possession of the officer, I find that he did have reasonable grounds to effect an arrest for impaired driving and that the grounds to make the demand are objectively sustainable.

4_1998canlii13643.txt,"The appellant sought an order quashing a decision of an adjudicator following a hearing pursuant to s. 62 of the Labour Standards Act. The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace.  2)The phrases 'patently unreasonable' and 'degree of deference' in a s63(1) appeal may have meanings materially different from those in a judicial review. 3)The hearing process before the adjudicator is not a highly specialized one.

The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.","The appellant sought an order quashing the adjudicator's decision following a hearing pursuant to s. 62.1 and 62.2 of The Labour Standards Act. The grounds relied on by the appellant gave rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjud adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract? (2) Whether the judge exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work? (3) The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at his conclusions. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)Cajon's president did not examine his company's lease (which was not produced at the hearing) in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the Respondent and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. Rather, Mr. Johns simply contacted the franchisor and was told that his employees should have followed the rules imposed upon Zellers employees. This does not seem reasonable on the part of the president in the circumstances. It has seven-year employee who presumably had performed her work satisfactorily and the only efforts by the employer were to ask Zellerers whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchiseisor. An employer surely must be expected to make further inquiries and to engage in further efforts to ensure that it can comply with its obligations under the employment contract (i.e. to permit its employees access to the workplace) before it can claim that it is incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 2)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the terms had not been frustrated by her conduct. 3)The appellant acted within its jurisdiction when deciding what terms of employment were and whether the terms should have been subject to proper notice.","[1] The appellant (""Cajon"") seeks an order quashing the

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants were convicted of unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The trial judge held that the appellants as Indians within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with an artificial light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or s. 901 of the Code. 2)The appellant had aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. The NRTA in 1930 altered those hunting rights. The provisions of the Wildlife Act altered those rights by eliminating commercial hunting; by expanding the hunting area to include all unoccupied Crown land; and by authorizing the Province to make conservation laws. 3)The respondent acknowledges that if Metis are Indians they enjoy hunting rights within s. 12 of the NRTA. Their argument is that they are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied crown land.","[1] This is an appeal by Mervin Maurice and Walter Gardiner from their summary conviction on October 5, 2001, for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998.

Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right. [18] The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples’ right:
1. Does the legislation have avalid objective?

2. Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples?

3. Has there been as little infringement as possible?

4. Has the Aboriginal group been consulted? But aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights.

The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety.

The landlord appealed, taking the position that there had been no mould and the tenant had simply used grey spray paint to resemble mould. It was also questioned how the mould could only have affected the tenant's furniture and area rug but not be obvious on the other carpeting. Landlord's appeal dismissed; amount of damages ordered increased; the Director went too far in discounting the value of the tenant's belongings. The court relied on the by-law inspector's (who had been called in by the tenant) findings, finding it impossible to believe that he could have been fooled by something as amateurish as spray paint and that the tenant, had she actually resorted to such a tactic, would have called in a building inspector and hoped to get away with it.","This is an appeal from an order of the Director dated December 13, 2007.

9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI.

HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1).

d_2009skqb44.txt,"The Ministry of Social Services seeks a 6 month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children, NS is four years old and DS is two years old. DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.",The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s.37(c) of the Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children. HELD: The order was granted with the condition that the children be returned to the father. The father was to continue living with the mother and the children while the mother attends to getting her addiction problems under control and then he would address his own addiction problems.  1) The father had a substantial criminal record which included 16 offences as youth. His youth offences were primarily property offences but primarily related to failing to comply with recognizances and probation orders. His last conviction was in January 2006 for failing to provide adequate drug screen results. 2) The mother was not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supported the position of the father who asked that they be returned in his care.,"The Ministry of Social Services (the Ministry) seeks a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act, S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2 (the “Act”) with respect to the two children. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. [3] H.H., the mother, is not seeking a return of the children to her directly but supports the position of N.O.S., the father, who asks that the children be returned to him in his care. [62] In my view, the children, if they are returned to N.O.S., will not receive at this time a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. I am not satisfied that either of N.O.S. and H.H., given their own difficulties, can provide that management based on my comments which follow. I find that the relationship is unstable. While both H.H. and N.O.S. are to be commended for their progress in this area, I am not convinced that the father’s addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control.

I find that Pacific Home Products Ltd. should bear 65% of the loss and Dennis Ens and Anne Ens, 35% of the loss. Further I find that the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time. [36] Therefore I award judgment in favour of the Plaintiff Ens’ against the Defendant Pacific Home Products Ltd. in the amount of $176.22.",0.29245283018867924,"The plaintiffs wanted to build deck and glass sunroom on the back of their home. They attended trade show and met the defendant, whose corporation had been in the business of building decks and sunrooms for 18 years. The plaintiffs contracted with the defendant to build their sunroom. The contract called for the provision of ten-foot deep, ten inch diameter concrete pilings to be the foundation for the deck upon which would sit glass sunroom. This provision was fundamental element in the contract. The type and design of the foundation was critical to the mutual satisfaction of both parties and the overall success of the installation in both the short and long term. The contract was frustrated when it was discovered that the intended foundation could not be constructed due to the high ground water in the town of Warman and specifically on the job site.  The plaintiffs sued the defendant for the return of their $2,200.00 deposit. The defendant filed a dispute note and counterclaimed for a balance they believed was owed to them of $3,604.13. HELD: There will be a judgment in favour of the plaintiffs against the defendant in the amount of $176.22. In the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs. Based on the facts and the applicable law, the contract was frustrated. The frustrating event or circumstance occurred after the formation of the contract. It was not reasonably foreseeable by either party. The change affected the fundamental nature of the contract. The event was permanent and non-transient. The contract as a result would be totally different from what the parties intended. The difference was much more than mere inconvenience. The supervening event was beyond the control of both parties and resulted in a significant change in the original obligation assumed by them. Both parties acted in good faith. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendant abandoned the contract. The court finds that the plaintiff has failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. The defendant, in its counterclaim, submitted that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract. The court finds that the defendant (plaintiff in the counterclaim) failed to prove that claim on a balance of probabilities. Considering all the facts presented in the case, the court finds that a just and reasonable resolution demands that the value of the expenses lost due to the frustration of the contract should be borne by the parties on a 65/35 ratio: the defendant should bear 65% of the loss, and the plaintiffs should bear 35% of the loss. The plaintiffs and the defendant were not on an equal plane. The plaintiffs relied on the contractor's experience to some degree, although not entirely. The defendant corporation may be able to further mitigate its losses over the course of time by using more parts salvaged from the material left over in the failed project. Further, the corporation will be able to write off this loss over the course of time.","HELD: The court awarded the plaintiff $176.22 for the sum of $3,604.13. The court found that the contract was not reasonably forseeable by either party and that the plaintiff should bear 65% of the loss and the plaintiffs and Ens' joint venture partners 35% and 35% of loss, respectively. Based on the facts as well as the applicable law, the plaintiff was found to have been frustrated. The plaintiff was awarded $96.13 for misappropriation of funds.","[8] The contract made on May 5, 2004 was clearly frustrated by the unforseen soil conditions which prevented the drilling of ten foot depth pile holes for concrete piles. [17] The Defendant in that claim, Pacific Home Products Ltd., filed a dispute note and became a Plaintiff in the Counterclaim against Dennis Ens and Anne Ens for recovery of the amount of $3,604.13, which they allege represents the losses incurred by Pacific Home Products Ltd. as a result of the frustration of the contract with Dennis Ens and Anne Ens. They then sued by way of Counterclaim against the Ens, Defendants in the Counterclaim for a balance, they believe owing to them, of $3,604.13.

The Commission overturned the decision of the stewards and restored the horse declared to be in first place. In issue was whether the hearsay opinions of stewards from other jurisdictions were admissible; whether the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by overturning the steward's decision to disqualify the horse; whether the Commission breached the rules of natural justice by failing to give notice of the hearing to the applicants. The respondents contended the privative clause in the Act gives the Commission the right to interpret the notice provisions of its empowering statute subject only to judicial review on the patently unreasonable standard. HELD: The application was allowed and the decision of the Commission was quashed.

The plaintiff alleged the contract price was in error and sought rectification of the contract. The commissioned salesman who was examined as the proper officer of the plaintiff gave evidence at the examination for discovery that he did not communicate the prices listed on his pricing sheet to the defendants but was adamant at trial that he had. HELD: The claim for rectification was dismissed. 1)The testimony of the president and general manager was not accepted. He signed the company's standard agreement which indicated that the price of the basement was included in the agreement. The salesman's evidence that he provided an approximate price contradicted his own notations and the notation was consistent with the evidence of the defendants.  2)A party seeking rectification must establish that the parties were of one mind as to the terms of the contract and the written record does not properly record that common intention. 3)The evidence was not clear as to when an interest rate of 15% was inserted into the document and the court was not satisfied that there was an agreement to pay interest.

It cannot accept that the plaintiff admits that he provided an approximate price on an RTM and basement. There was a mutual or common mistake in the written expression of the agreement and rectification may be made upon satisfying the Court that there is an actual concluded agreement.

However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction.

The medical evidence established beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. The only issue, therefore, was the identity of the person who committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in a reasonable manner 'worthy of belief'. The Crown also called a social worker trained in counselling. The social worker testified that she interviewed the complainant and others involved in the case and concluded that the child exhibited many of the symptoms often found in children who have been sexually abused, such as depression, attempts to block out recollection of events, low self-esteem, lack of trust in others and an inability to be specific as to details.

However, evidence of the complainant's school counsellor was inadmissible as hearsay, but notwithstanding, its admission was not so grave an error as to call for a quashing of the conviction. The conviction was determined to have been a verdict which a jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.","At issue in this case was whether the admission of hearsay evidence was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. Dismissing the appeal, that the evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by Dr. Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions which frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of child, was admissible.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per oral reasons for judgment of Macdonald, J.A.; Hallett and Chipman, JJ.A. concurring.

The respondent argued that the proceeds from the Action would be used first and foremost for the purpose of preventing the impairment or defeat of the Act and that if the assets were not available for claim, society would inevitably assume the respondent's responsibility for his dependents. The court found that the existing ex-parte order wrongly assumes that he will dissipate his assets; that the entire underpinning of the order is based on an uninformed and biased assumption that a person who has received social assistance for the majority of his adult life and then receives a lump sum of money will somehow squander his money without regard to his moral and legal support obligations. 5)The Court found that there was insufficient evidence upon which it could reasonably conclude that the respondent acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family.

The respondent applies to have the order set aside. The respondent argues that a restraining order under the Act is a preservation of property order and should not be granted because the petitioner has not met the tests that govern the granting of such orders. He submits that the criteria for the granting of a preservation order is the same as for a interlocutory injunction. The respondent argues that before the Court can exercises its discretion and grant an order, is should have some evidence that the party being restrained would defeat a claim under the Act. HELD: The Court is satisfied that the respondent's personal claim for damages is the only asset the he has to satisfy the claim under the Act. Without prejudicing the applicant's claim, the Court will arbitrarily determine that the sum of $40,000 will likely be sufficient security. For the time being, the order will attach to the first $40,000 of funds received by the respondent, if and when any amount becomes payable to him. The parties may apply to vary this amount in future. Costs are reserved to be dealt with on the hearing of the application for maintenance. The Court is not satisfied that the jurisprudence with respect to injunctive remedies based on inherent jurisdiction of the court applies to an application under s.8 of the Act. If the criteria for granting a restraining order under the Act were meant to be the same, there would be no need for the unique provision of the Act. As s.8 was enacted to provide a solution where none had existed, the Court must primarily look to the statute itself for a determination of the appropriate considerations. Section 8 of the Act grants the Court the authority to restrain the disposition of assets and creates a new, but limited, form of injunctive relief with this remedy being available solely to prevent the impairment or defeat of the Act. The statute does not require the Court to be satisfied that the respondent is hindering or defeating a claim. When a respondent has only one asset that could reasonably satisfy a claim, his dependents and society as a whole have an interest in ensuring that the asset will be used for such purpose.","The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act (the “Act”) which: 1) restrains the Attorney General of Canada from releasing or paying any monies to the respondent or his solicitors in relation to a claim in Queen’s Bench Action No. Q.B.G. No. 2270/97, J.C. Regina; and 2)restrains MLT from disposing of any of the monies that he has received or may receive in connection to the Action or any claim against the AG. 3)The respondent has only one asset that could reasonably become a source of satisfying a claim under the Act. It is so ordered that the sum of $40,000.00 will be sufficient security for the claim. 4)The court reviewed the wording of s. 55 of The Matrimonial Property Act (1997) and found that it would be unfair to continue the restraining order against the respondent if the proceeds of the Action were disposed of. The respondent argued that the proceeds from the Action would be used first and foremost for the purpose of preventing the impairment or defeat of the Act and that if the assets were not available for claim, society would inevitably assume the respondent's responsibility for his dependents. The court found that the existing ex-parte order wrongly assumes that he will dissipate his assets; that the entire underpinning of the order is based on an uninformed and biased assumption that a person who has received social assistance for the majority of his adult life and then receives a lump sum of money will somehow squander his money without regard to his moral and legal support obligations. 5)The Court found that there was insufficient evidence upon which it could reasonably conclude that the respondent acquired substantial funds that he would imprudently or improperly dispose of such funds or otherwise fail to use them to support his family. The Court applied to the Court to arbitrarily determine the sum was sufficient security and to lift the order. 6)Section 7 of The Act provides a new but very limited form of injunctive relief with this extraordinary remedy. The only requirement is that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat the Act claim.  7)Section 8(d) provides for a balance of convenience in deciding whether an application for restraining order should be granted.","[1] The petitioner obtained an ex parte order under s. 8(1) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.

The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him.

2009nssc86.txt,"The applicant applied under the Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order of mandamus compelling the respondent department to comply with a prior order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board. The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated. He sought retroactive amounts for the period falling between the appeal board's order and the time of reinstatement. Order granted, costs to the applicant in the amount of $750: assistance to be reinstated retroactively according to the time frame ordered by the appeal board. The respondent's argument that the applicant should be required to appeal their most recent decision on eligibility must be rejected. It would not be appropriate to require the applicant to appeal the respondent's refusal to abide by an existing appeal decision. To allow the respondent to ignore the appeal board's ruling and request additional information effectively undermines the appeal board's authority and makes a ruling by them meaningless. As for the other requirements for mandamus, the applicant had a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding, the duty to him arose from the appeal board's decision, and the relevant Regulations (see Assistance Appeal Regulations, s. 14) confirm the respondent had no discretion to refuse to implement the appeal board's decision or to change the time period referenced in that decision.","This was an application under Civil Procedure Rules (1972) for an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the respondent to comply with an order of the Income Assistance Appeal Board, dated September 17th, 2007. The applicant was disabled and had been receiving income assistance from the Department of Community Services since May 2006. He re-applied for income assistance in may 2007. His application was again denied based on failure to provide requested information. The Department refused to provide further financial information and continued to refuse to reinstate eligibility from June 27th to September 7th as a period covered by the order.

As to the other requirements of mandamus; the Applicant has a legal interest in the outcome of the proceeding; the duty to the Applicant arises from the Appeal Board’s decision which binds the Respondent as per the regulations; the regulations also confirm the Respondent has no discretion, either as to whether the decision is binding generally or as to the time period effected.

The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.

4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They have three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief was dismissed without prejudice to the petitioner's right to claim child support. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. The fact that one is not the biological parent does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide maintenance for his or her child. 2)The circumstances of the'rent' that the applicant claims she pays are somewhat cloudy. After the separation, she moved back to the residence on Sinotte Crescent. She claims that she pays rent in the amount of $150.68 weekly (which amounts to $7,835.36 yearly). The credit card entry is double entry in that it is not an expense not already covered by the other expenses. When the petitioner caught wind of the fact that items were being sold, she was able to convince the local business person to forward the sale proceeds from these items to her lawyer, where they currently are held in trust.","[5] Ms. McPhail commenced a petition on October 14, 2008, in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2, and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2. Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1. Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order? [23] In this case, based on the affidavit material before me, I conclude that Ms. McPhail has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children. Dr. Hunt may have stood in loco parentis to the children, however I cannot determine that on the conflicting affidavit materials currently before me. [25] There is no dispute that Ms. McPhail and Dr. Hunt cohabited as spouses for in excess of two years, and that she is a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. [32] Also, although the parties had combined incomes approaching $350,000 per annum, it appears that their assets, after deducting their liabilities, result in a minimal net worth. [33] Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, I conclude that Ms. McPhail is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from Dr. Hunt to Ms. McPhail, in the interim, should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. Taking into account all of these factors, the relevant legislative enactments and the legal principles that have been consistently applied in this province, I conclude that a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. [34] Accordingly, I order that Dr. Hunt pay to Ms. McPhail the sum of $1,500 per month commencing September 1, 2009. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, I order that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months.

The fact that one is not the biological parent of a child does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide financial support for that child. 3)Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, a modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem.","[5] Ms. McPhail commenced a petition on October 14, 2008, in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.3, The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2, and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2. Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1. Has Ms. McPhail established a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order? [23] In this case, based on the affidavit material before me, I conclude that Ms. McPhail has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that Dr. Hunt stood in loco parentis to the children. Dr. Hunt may have stood in loco parentis to the children, however I cannot determine that on the conflicting affidavit materials currently before me. [25] There is no dispute that Ms. McPhail and Dr. Hunt cohabited as spouses for in excess of two years, and that she is a “spouse” by virtue of the definition in the Act. [32] Also, although the parties had combined incomes approaching $350,000 per annum, it appears that their assets, after deducting their liabilities, result in a minimal net worth. [33] Given all of these somewhat unusual factors, I conclude that Ms. McPhail is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from Dr. Hunt to Ms. McPhail, in the interim, should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problem. Taking into account all of these factors, the relevant legislative enactments and the legal principles that have been consistently applied in this province, I conclude that a spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is the appropriate interim amount that ought to be paid and should be sufficient to relieve her from some of the economic hardship that she has encountered as a result of the matrimonial breakdown. [34] Accordingly, I order that Dr. Hunt pay to Ms. McPhail the sum of $1,500 per month commencing September 1, 2009. However, given the short-term relationship and to add impetus to having the issues resolved sooner rather than later, I order that these payments be paid for a total period of eight months. Accordingly, Ms. McPhail’s application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.",0.46715328467153283,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","HELD: The court granted interim relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, and The Children’s Law Act, 1997.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. The warrant alleged that the accused, an accountant who ran his business out of his home, filed a fraudulent T4 and created false T4 income in order to obtain a tax refund and misreported HST sales. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias.","The applicant sought an order in the nature of certiorari (pursuant to Rule 58 and s. 482(3)(c) of the Criminal Code) relating to the issuance of a search warrant on May 3, 2005.

The sentencing judge ordered full restitution. The appellants appealed; the Crown conceded that the appeal should be allowed. Allowing the appeal, that while the agreement reached by the Crown and the appellants was not binding upon the sentencing judge, the joint recommendation was a fit sentence; in the circumstances there was no sound reason for departing from it.","The appellants pleaded guilty to fraud over $5000 and were sentenced by the Crown to two (2) years probation and restitution of one-half of the amount of the fraud. The Crown and defence advanced a joint sentencing recommendation for 2 years probation, restitution of 1/2 of the overpayment and a fine of $32,866. Each gave half of the money to the paymaster. The judge accepted the joint recommendation for probation but ordered restitution in the full amount. The appellants applied for leave and, if granted, appeal the judge's decision to order restitution of the remainder amount rather than one half as submitted in the Joint recommendation.

The rationale for the recommendation of restitution was that the appellants had only retained for themselves 1/4 of the total amount of overpayment because, as noted, they had been required to give the other half back. The Court was advised that Trenton Works was content with this proposal and that the other one half would be sought in restitution order against the defendant who was to be before the courts shortly. 3)Leave to appeal was granted.

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for term of two months. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September. The plaintiff alleges that the contract was also extended for further three months from September 30 until December 2005. The trial judge concluded that the respondent was deriving benefit from both his employer and from competitor. He also found that although the giving of unreasonable notice constituted a fundamental breach of the employment contract, the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal. The employment contract had not terminated until October 7, 1995. The claim against PCS is dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is awarded costs against Sullivan. 1)The trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2)The plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. 3)The court found no case law on point in this province and was unable to distinguish Sullivan's actions from those of Restauronics.",[2] The plaintiff also claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation Inc.

8_2011skca35.txt,"The applicants applied for leave to appeal from a Chambers decision denying their application to dismiss the respondent's claim against them for want of prosecution. The applicants were partners in an architecture firm that provided design drawing and specifications for the construction of the Education Building at the University of Saskatchewan. The building was substantially completed in 1970. In 1985, stone panels fell off the exterior of the building. In 1986 the respondent commenced an action against its insurer for coverage of the loss. In 1991, the insurer commenced an action against the applicants in order to preserve the respondent's right to relief. In 1997, the Court determined the respondent was not entitled to coverage from its insurer. The respondent commenced control over the litigation against the applicant in 1997. Between 1997 and 2010, documents were exchanged, discoveries were held and an unsuccessful settlement negotiation was held. In 2010 all of the defendants applied to have the respondent's claim dismissed for want of prosecution. The Chambers judge struck the claims against all the defendants except the applicant. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted because there was some merit to the applicant's arguments that they had been treated inconsistently and that key witnesses were no longer available to testify because of death or mental or physical disability, which would prejudice the applicant.

Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts.

The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. It was concluded the respondent's father owned the tractor. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. There were no records of the value of the pigs. Whatever the number brought into the marriage, it had been reduced by the sale of the animals. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261.

F-6.3. [3] In the circumstances, the family property should be divided equally. He testified that prior to the marriage he owned a Case 800 tractor and a J.D. 400 mix mill. Accordingly, I find them to be exempt. As a result, I allow a partial exemption and in doing so fix the value of the snowmobile at $800.00. As a result, while the respondent owned a truck prior to the marriage it cannot be traced to the subject truck. To this must be added $2,400.00 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. [30] In summary, the value of livestock to be distributed as between the parties is as follows. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, I treat it as being exempt. [35] There is a claim for $16,500.00 which is said to be owing to the father for the Versatile 160 tractor. I have already found that the father owns the tractor. I therefore reject this suggested debt. [36] Next there is a claim in respect to monies allegedly owing to the father in respect to the Case 970, the 1155 tractor and the I.H. truck. Both are statute barred and I therefore decline to take them into account. Finally, there is a debt of $1,200.00 supposedly owed to the father in respect to the Morris rod weeder. I am not convinced this is actually owing and therefore reject it. [37] Over a period of time the respondent paid out monies on account of fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance. Accordingly, she should bear no responsibility for the payments made and I decline to take them into consideration. The petitioner also claims a debt of $1,000.00 for money she borrowed from a friend to make a payment on account of legal fees. I do not consider this to be a matrimonial debt.

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that the workplace stressors experienced by the respondent worker were not unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case, which was reviewed for correctness. The issue was whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if so, whether it applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA) and sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain legal principles that must be met. The first requirement is that the stressors must be excessively and unusually stressful, objectively viewed and, in the actual case of the individual worker, give rise to the mental or physical condition on which the claim is based. The second requirement is the exclusion of work related events such as 'routine employment related actions' and 'labour relations issues'. WCAT did not err in failing to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to the contrary to rebut that opinion. The third requirement is an objective assessment of the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. This is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GECA and furthers its overall intent to provide no fault compensation for injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The question of whether the policy is more restrictive than the general law that applies to GECA is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The Court found that WCAT erred in finding that there were 'unusual or excessive' stressors in the workplace which could ground a claim for gradual onset stress. It found that they were not. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors, there was no causal link between those stressors and his stress injury.","Held: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [1] This appeal turns on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. G-5 (GECA), was the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) wrong to assess the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view? (i) in finding that the worker\'s subjective reaction to external stressors in the workplace was not relevant to determining if he suffered a compensable accident under s. 4(1) of the GECA; For the reasons which follow, my view is that WCAT correctly applied the objective approach to determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress under GECA and that such an approach was the correct one, both under Policy 1.3.6 and under the general law applying to GECA claims in Nova Scotia.

It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

The insured property was totally destroyed by fire some 22 hours before the deadline. The mortgage was in both names and the insured insured did not know of the fire loss.

The police first noticed the accused when he got out of his vehicle (which was parked near a pub), staggered slightly and then got back in. The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).

It may be speculation or conjecture to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind.","[1] Matthew Stephen Kidson is charged that on August 12, 2006 in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia he:

The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat. He also testified that he did not intend to drive the vehicle. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. 1)The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation or conjecture to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind.",0.4460431654676259
4_2006skca76.txt,"The appeal is from an order granting interim custody of a 10 year old girl to her father, notwithstanding that the child had been in the custody of the mother since the mother and father separated about 4 years ago. During the separation the father paid some maintenance for the child pursuant to an agreement made by the parties themselves, and had extensive access to the child, she spending at least one weekend a month with him, as well as the summer holiday. HELD: Appeal allowed orally.  1) The oral reasons of the Family Court judge granting interim custody to the father were not available to the court, so it had no reasons for the decision available to assist it in the review of the decision. 2) The appeal must succeed. Even assuming the Investigation Record was admissible into evidence by reason of the agreement of the parties, and that the psychologist's report was admissible into evidence under s. 97 of The Queen's Bench Act, both of which propositions are at least arguable, there is no evidence other than unsworn hearsay evidence upon which it could be found that the mother was alcoholic and that the child suffered from it, while there is sworn evidence from the mother denying that to be so, as well as sworn evidence from three other persons supporting the mother's evidence to at least some degree. The father's affidavits are the only sworn evidence filed in support of his case. It is apparent that the father had no personal knowledge of the mother's drinking habits during the past four years, nor any personal knowledge of how the mother cared for the children. 3) It is apparent that none of the authors of the documents supporting the father's position that the mother is an alcoholic and is not properly caring for the child (the Investigation Record and The Drug and Alcohol Assessment Report) had any personal knowledge that that is the case.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered. The Court held that there must be manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behaviour in order to find a breach of fundamental justice. Here the impugned conduct only affects the weight to be given to the evidence of the police officers. The conversation complained of took place outside of the courtroom at trial and was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges. There was no tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. Even if the Court had found breach of fundamental justice, stay would not be appropriate. After the conversation was discovered, it was reported to the Court and the trial was adjourned to permit full disclosure of the impugned conversation and to give counsel an opportunity to prepare in light of the development. stay is to be entered only in the clearest of cases. Here the right of the defendant to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence as the Court was able to assess the weight to be given to the officers' evidence. The Charter application for a stay of proceedings alleging a breach of fundamental justice is denied.","The accused was charged with three counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to s255(1) and 253(a), over.08 contrary to ss253(b) and driving while disqualified contrary so s259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 3 in the Information. 1)The Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the vehicle when the accident occurred and at all material times. The impugned conduct affects only the weight to be given to the evidence of the witnesses notwithstanding the conduct complained of. The right of the accused to a fair trial has not been prejudiced by the introduction of this evidence in these circumstances. 2)The conversation complained of was not material to the outcome of the trial or the charges before it. There was no bad intent on the part of the officers nor did they find tailoring of the evidence as consequence of the discussion. The accused's testimony was most apparent to me because of his insistence that there were only two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving. The driver of the Sunfire was unsteady on his feet and leaned on vehicle to support himself. He had alcohol on his breath and his eyes were bloodshot. The cab driver's testimony that he saw the accused get out of his truck and fall asleep enroute to his destination was questionable. The police were operating under very tight time lines in order to meet the requirements permitting reliance on the presumption. 3)The Court was unable to conclude that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident. The Court found that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugning behavior in order for the Crown to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice. In these circumstances, the accused's driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. In any event, the Court found the accused guilty of counts 3 and 3.","CHARGES [1] Thomas Alexander Spark is charged with 3 counts in relation to one incident occurring March 20, 1999 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan: impaired driving contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(a), over .08 contrary to sections 253(b) and 255(1) and driving while disqualified contrary so section 259(4), all of the Criminal Code of Canada. Yes. The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused’s driving was impaired by alcohol having regard to the test in R. v. Stellato. No. There has not been a breach of fundamental justice. [29] Where there are inconsistencies between the Crown and the Defence witnesses, I accept the evidence of the Crown witnesses over that of the Defendant. I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Crown has proven that the Defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and at all material times. [32] In light of this, the Crown having filed a Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition, I find the Defendant guilty of count 3 in the Information. [36] As I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident, I find the Defendant not guilty of count 2 in the Information. [39] I find, having considered the test in R. v. Stellato, supra, that I have no doubt whatsoever that the Defendant’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. In short he has argued that there is an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that should compel me to enter a stay of proceedings. I do not agree. I’m of the view that there must be a manifest unfairness in the trial process as a result of the impugned behavior in order for me to find that there has been a breach of fundamental justice.

7_2010nssc146.txt,"The accused, who faced three counts of trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking, had negotiated agreements with the Crown that preserved her right to re-elect from a trial by judge and jury to a trial by judge alone and provided that she would not contest the admissibility of a video statement she had given to the police and, if a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the Crown's case was unsuccessful, she would testify in her own defence. Following a voir dire and one-and-a-half days of trial, new evidence (which could be used to impeach the accused's credibility and contradict things she had told the police in the video statement) came to the Crown's attention. The accused argued that the admission of this new evidence would adversely affect her approach to the trial as important tactical decisions had been made on the strength of the Crown's previous disclosure. Mistrial declared; the accused is released from the undertakings and agreements made to date and has the right to re-elect her mode of trial. The late disclosure breached the accused's ability to make full answer and defence owing to the decisions she had already made regarding her defence and trial strategy and prejudiced her in a number of ways, which prejudice could not be cured by an adjournment or other order at this late stage. However, to proceed with the trial without the new evidence would be unfair to the Crown and compromise the court's 'truth seeking' function.","The accused brought an application for relief under s.24(1) of the Charter alleging that the Crown's intention to adduce the newly discovered evidence has adversely affected her s. and 11(d) Charter rights. The accused argued that she had no knowledge of the contents of the prisoner package seized following the search of Thomas Izzard and of the other evidence of drugs seized from her home pursuant to a search warrant executed soon thereafter. To that end, through her counsel, she negotiated a number of matters with the Crown. At the conclusion of the trial, defence counsel notified defence counsel of the new evidence and disclosure was provided to defence counsel within twenty-four hours of the Crown learning of it. The Crown argued strenuously that the information which it has now recently disclosed was already in the possession of the accused because she participated in the discussions with Corporal Vail. HELD: A mistrial was ordered. 1)The accused gave up her right to contest the admissibility of the video taped evidence and her right not to call defence evidence and to remain silent. 2)The Court was satisfied that the accused had not been prejudiced by the disclosure of evidence. 3)The trial was fair from the perspective of the public and society more broadly. The trial would be fair from a point of view of fairness and balance of probabilities. 4)There was no dispute between the parties on the general obligations of disclosure imposed on the Crown beginning with the Supreme Court's decision in Stinchcombe, [1991] S.C.R. 326, which has been followed and elaborated on ever since it was decided in 1991. The court is always reluctant to order a mistrial except in the clearest of cases and when the impugned conduct undermines trial fairness or the decision making process. In this case, the accused took positive steps to place her knowledge and intent at issue. She agreed to have her video taped statement go in without contest. During that video, she raised the issue of willful blindness which was critical in this case. The “truth seeking” function of the court would be compromised if I were to grant an order excluding evidence which the parties clearly recognize as important.","Result: Mistrial ordered.

There were no conditions precedent attached to the committment. 3)As the plaintiffs were entitled to relief the arguments concerning adequacy of notice from the defendant was not addressed. 4)The plaintiffs were awarded costs.","The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they had complied with the requirements of s. 27(2) of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them the lands which were subject of their exercise of their right of first refusal under the Act. The defendant resisted the requested relief on the basis the plaintiffs did not comply with the required time frame. Specifically that they did not meet the requirements set out in s. 28(2)(b) of the Act which required an unconditional and unequivocal letter of commitment from a recognized financial institution to finance within reasonable period of time the farmer's purchase of the farm land that was the subject of the offer and for the price stated in the letter. The plaintiff counterclaimed against the defendant for rent it claims owing from the plaintiffs as handover holding tenants. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were entitled to relief pursuant to ss. 27 of the Farm Land security Act in an effort to restore the farmer to his prior position as owner of the land in the event such person had the financial means to repurchase the land. 2) The defendant offered a different requirement for the exercise of the right to first refusal in its offer enclosed with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. In the offer form, it did not require that it be forwarded directly to the financial institution, but simply required that the plaintiffs 'provide' such a letter. 3) The defendants counterclaimed that the legislation was not complied with. 4) The court declined to address the arguments advanced with respect to this issue.","[1] The plaintiffs seek a declaration that they have
complied with the requirements of section 27(2) of The
Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c.S-17.1 (the
""Act""), and an order requiring the defendant to sell to them
the lands which are the subject of their exercise of their
right of first refusal under the Act. [15] The short answer to this argument is that the
defendant waived its right to insist on strict compliance with
the legislation by offering a different requirement for the
exercise of the right of first refusal in its offer enclosed
with the cover letter dated March 24, 1997. [18] The first point to observe about the wording of s.
27(2)(b)(ii) of the Act, and the wording used by the defendant
in its offer of first refusal is that both refer to a letter
of commitment to finance; - not a letter of credit binding
the financial institution to advance money in any event. To interpret the letter of commitment
referred to in the Act in a manner that would exclude mortgage
financing, would eliminate the ability of most farmers to
exercise the right of first refusal. (1) A declaration they have complied with the
requirements of s. 27 of The Farm Land Security
Act in exercising their right of first refusal
with respect to the subject land. (2) An order that the defendant forthwith transfer
to the plaintiffs the subject land for the
price of $629,280.00, which price is payable to
the defendant by the plaintiffs on the usual
trust conditions.

Deficiencies included a large crack in a ceiling, a loose overhang, a plugged eaves trough which overflowed and stained the stucco, peeling paint, tiles which fell off, missing soffits, defective weatherstripping, cracks around the skylights and build outs and a defective steam shower. The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61. The $4,000.83 withheld by the plaintiff was set off against this claim. 1)It was intended the round pillars would be part of the contract. They were not an extra that the plaintiff should be responsible for. 2)The steam room was an extra ordered by the plaintiff but he was entitled to rely upon the representations of the defendant as to cost. 3)The parties agreed the amount to be charged to the plaintiff was the actual cost to the defendant. Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence. It is alleged that the defendant failed to perform as agreed and in consequence the plaintiff seeks damages. The defendant resists the claim and by way of a counterclaim seeks judgment for extras requested by the plaintiff.

The defendant counterclaimed for extras requested by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $7,654.61.

Production of the invoices was not a condition precedent to payment. The charges were found to be fit and proper. 4)Aside from the basement drain, the plaintiff paid nothing for the repair of deficiencies. 5)The 4 month delay was attributable to both parties. The plaintiff enjoyed savings by way of not paying interest. He was entitled to recover one-half of the loss of potential rent and lost storage charges for the use of the garage due to the delay.  6)The deficiencies were relatively minor and the cost of repairing them at the time of the sale of the house in 1997 would not have exceeded $1,000. It is not uncommon for custom built luxury houses to sell for less than their original cost. 7)The claim against the individual defendant was dismissed as there was no evidence that he was a party to the construction contract or that he acted in any capacity other than that of an officer of the corporate defendant. 8)Costs may be spoken to.","The plaintiff engaged the defendant, D & S Homes Ltd., to construct a residence.

d_1997canlii11439.txt,"The petitioner sought an order under the Dependent's Relief Act that the younger child share equally with his brother in the estate of their deceased father. Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively.

Application for leave to apply to this court from time to time for further direction or clarification as may be required. A more generous award may result. The deceased himself provided in the will that the Executors had absolute and uncontrolled discretion to encroach on capital for the purposes of child maintenance, education, benefit and advancement. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and, whereas in Thauberger (supra) the interest income exceeded the level of support claimed, here it is unknown what income the Estate will generate. These calculations are only crude estimation but have attempted to consider the children's current needs weighed against what the Estate can reasonably bear in all the unknown circumstances.","The petitioner seeks an order under The Dependents'

8_1997canlii11328.txt,"The two accused, both Metis, were separately charged in 1993 with six fishing offences relating to the use of nets. The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondents following trial in Provincial Court on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act.

The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondents following trial on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Each accused was separately charged with six offences arising out of fishing activities on two lakes in northwestern Saskatchewan on December 1, 1993. The Crown argued that the respondents were in fact fishing for food and an aboriginal right to fish for food. The trial judge found the accused not guilty on counts 1, 2 and 6 but for the constitutional defence which he found to be established. It is the acquittals based on the Crown's brief that are the subject of this Crownappeal. HELD: The Crown appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge erred in law by failing to establish that the defendants were fishing for commercial purposes. 2)The Crown did not intend to change the issues at this time and to argue in your Brief an issue which was not argued at trial. 3)The Court found that the Crown intended not by word or action to make commercial fishing the constitutional issue at least prior to their brief which gave rise to this motion.","The appellant\'s notice of appeal sets out six
grounds as follows:

1. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to distinguish between an
Aboriginal right to fish for food and an
Aboriginal right to fish for commercial
purposes;

2. That the learned Trial judge erred by
failing to hold that the Accused were
engaged in commercial fishing;

3. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to hold that neither the
Accused nor any of their ancestors at any
time possessed an Aboriginal right to fish
for commercial purposes;

4. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by concluding that the scrip issued to
Metis pursuant to section 6(f) of the
Dominion Lands Act, R.S.C. 1906, c. 55 and
Order-in-Council P.C. 1459 did not
extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish
for food or commercial purposes possessed
by the Metis;

5. That the learned Trial Judge erred in
law by failing to conclude that the
requirement to obtain a licence before
engaging in fishing by means of a net set
out in section 26(a) of the Saskatchewan
Fishery Regulations does not constitute a
prima facie infringement of any existing
Aboriginal right to fish for food or
commercial purposes possessed by the
Accused;

6. The learned Trial Judge erred in law by
acquitting the Accused on the charge under
section 27 of the Saskatchewan Fishery
Regulations when neither the Aboriginal
rights defence nor the equality rights
defence had any application to the charge. He was
entitled to do so, and such a finding of fact should not be
disturbed by this Court acting on appeal. purposes. For the foregoing reasons, grounds 1, 2 and 3 of the
appeal are dismissed. The trial judge\'s finding that an aboriginal right to fish
existed in the Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan
separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title is one
he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. In considering whether a
licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the
aboriginal right to fish for food, there is no basis to
distinguish between the aboriginal groups with respect to what
constitutes infringement. A third consideration which does not arise from the
regulatory regime, is the departmental policy which places a
higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence
food fishing for Metis persons. However, once it has been held that the
domestic food fishing licence requirement infringes the
aboriginal right to fish for food, it follows that the
Regulation requiring a person to legibly mark that licence
number on the stakes is also an infringement that cannot be
justified, for the simple reason there is no requirement on a
Metis person in the geographical area delineated by the trial
judge, to have the licence. appeal.

The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and s.2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. There had been prior mischief complaints from the public regarding activity on the wharf and the officers approached several youth standing near vehicles. One of the youth approached the officers and asked who owned the vehicle. The officer indicated that he was going to search the vehicle for liquor and then found a large amount of cash in the back seat of the vehicle cooler. When the officer went to move a knapsack on the floor to check for further liquor, it felt heavy and he further could feel what he thought might be bottles contained within. When he returned to the vehicle, he found three rolls of cash and a large bag of cash. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine and cash rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that these rolls were proceeds of drug trafficking. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court. 1)The evidence was admissible against the accused. The evidence was circumstantial in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the defendant's possession. 2)There was no reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court. The only inference drawn from the evidence was not only that the knapsacks was in the personal possession of the defendant but that, because they contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the same bag as cocaine and because no one else had access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there. 3)The officer testified that he had knowledge that the items in his personal possession were found in the vehicle console where the police later found it and that he placed them at his feet in the front passenger seat. 4)The Court accepted the evidence of Robinson.","[1] Shea Patrick William Ernst is charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. I therefore find that that cocaine had been in the defendant’s personal possession up to the point of handing it to Hyslop and thereafter was in the joint possession of the defendant and Hyslop. [21] In regard to the drugs and money found in the knapsack, I note that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the motor vehicle, that no one else had any access to it from then until the police seized it. [22] In short, I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant, but that, because it contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapsack, and because no one else had access to the knapsack, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there. [25] For the reasons stated above, I find that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 each were in the possession of the defendant and that, because they were in small denominations, found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference here is that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking.

The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned.

c_2003skqb58.txt,"Canadian veterans of the Korean War or World War II applied for certification of an action under the Class Actions Act. The plaintiffs claimed they and their dependents were treated differently than non-native war veterans by requiring benefits to be administered by the Department of Indian Affairs or through Indian agents and claimed damages for loss of benefits based on systemic negligence, breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment. They alleged officials and Indian agents were negligent in carrying out their duties to inform the plaintiffs of their right to receive full and complete benefits and in some case agents misappropriated benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. A class action is not the preferable procedure in the circumstances. The issue of discoverability relating to each plaintiff overwhelms any common issues. It is not possible to determine issues of discoverability in any global fashion. It will be necessary to have an inquiry into the state of mind of each individual plaintiff over a period of 40 years. Such a class action would be completely unmanageable and certification would result in a multitude of individual trials, which would completely override any advantage that might be derived from a trial of a few potential common issues.

The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Court for review under s. 103 of the Act. The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order.

The Youth Court judge focused unduly on the provincial director's lack of authority to'suspend' community supervision under s.102 and the contrast in this regard with the power of the director under s106 to suspend conditional supervision is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the respondent in custody.",0.43785310734463273

As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were previously before the Court in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property. Due to change in circumstances, it was necessary to sever of the matters of custody and access and support. This judgment deals with the divorce of a young couple who resided in the family home on the SE¼-27‑52-05-W3rd in the Province of Saskatchewan. The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, there was no evidence as to how the value arrived at other than an inspection of the property. HELD: 1) The Court ordered the sale and distribution of proceeds from something less than the entirety of the family property as of the date of application and found the value to be $95,100.  2) There was nothing in the evidence that would lead to conclusion that the adjudication was to be preferred over the time of application. 3) The evidence was accepted as to the value of the home. The appraisal was in format and follows procedure long recognized by the Court. The letter was simply that, letter from a real estate agent. The Court will select the date for adjudication only if some unusual circumstance, like substantial changes in value caused by market forces, will create an artificial result if the date is selected.","[1] The parties were recently before me in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property.

The law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could be used to their detriment. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should undoubtedly err on the side of protecting the privilege. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel. The letter was marked 'Without Prejudice' and began with: 'My proposal is reasonable so must be good, reasonable parent; by failing to accept that reasonable proposal, she must be unreasonable and, therefore not as good parent.'

HELD: 1) Settlement negotiations are protected by a jointly held privilege that cannot be waived by any one party acting alone. This privilege is fundamental to the policy interest of promoting settlement discussions as means to avoiding trial. It should only be set aside if there is a very compelling, competing policy warranting such a proposal.

If the award determined by the tariff does not represent a substantial contribution towards the parties reasonable expenses, the resulting reduction in total income serves to diminish the litigant's tax bill. 1) Costs are assessed against the applicant. They are payable at rate of $150 per month until paid in full, commencing December 1, 2012. 2) Costs awarded based on an application of Scale of Tariff “A” of the Costs and Fees Act, supra is the governing tariff for the purpose of determining an appropriate costs award.","Issues: Whether costs should be awarded following separate custody and child support hearings on October 25, 2011 and June 20, 2012 respectively.

d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.",The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Actions Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed to provide basic water services at various Holguin resorts including the following: Playa Costa Verda; Club Covarrubias; Grand Playa Pesquero; and Hotel Sol Rio de Luna Mares. HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act did not restrict the ability of the plaintiff to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. The Court found that if the plaintiff could not find viable plaintiffs in time for the certification hearing and rule that the Ragoonanan motion succeeded then that would fatal to a large number of unsuspecting plaintiffs. 1) The Court held that it was not necessary for the Court to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification. 2) It was not in the Court's view that the usual approach to civil litigation does not allow for plaintiff to demand defendant produce plaintiff. 3) The court was not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.'s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. 4) The plaintiff was not seeking through this motion to restrain the defendant from distributing the package nor to have the court direct Inco to change any portion of the material.,"Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. This is still an “action” and not a “class action”. 68) I therefore dismiss both motions brought by MLG without costs.",0.38799076212471134,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated.

The motion was dismissed. The court found that the wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Act created a concern about the suspension of time limitations for actions that had already been certified. The Court dismissed the application. Based on the plain wording of the judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit, the application for examination dismissed. It is not necessary for the court to get into the whole issue of examination of witnesses prior to certification. If the motion succeeds, the action will be dismissed against the defendant only.","Indeed Ottenbreit J. directed that the only thing the plaintiffs could do was to file a reply affidavit within three days. 17) In my view it is not reasonable for the MLG several weeks after the deadline for filing the reply affidavit to embark on a totally different approach (i.e. examining the affidavit as opposed to providing their own evidence). 18) It appears to me that the actual purpose of examining Ms. Moore is not to challenge her version of the circumstances leading up to the signing of the alleged settlement agreements by the Roussys, but rather a more general and broad ranging interrogation of Ms. Moore about other customers who may have booked through her office with Red Seal at the relevant time of this case. 19) Accordingly, based on the plain wording of Justice Ottenbreit J.’s judgment and the context of the preparation of the Moore affidavit; I must dismiss the application for examination on the Moore affidavit. This is still an “action” and not a “class action”. 68) I therefore dismiss both motions brought by MLG without costs.",0.46808510638297873,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. The respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousa maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal Support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was “disabled and still receiving treatments”, that her was enrolled in legal assistant program, and that she had sought permanent full time employment since losing the Westfair foods position, but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate that she could not work and did not, in fact, say she was unable to work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking a full time position. 2) The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $13,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage. He found the respondent's income to be $38,964.37.

At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure.

HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis must be clear. 2)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward a final agreement would constitute separate, independent and binding agreement irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. These circumstances lead rather to the conclusion that each items agreed to was subject to reaching an overall final agreement. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce. 3)The fiat ended: Pre-trial for continuation with respect to maintenance, jewellery and debts of the wife.","Appeal Allowed: September 14, 1995 (orally) The appeal is from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of Dr. Verma\'s pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences.

b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway in the community of Woods Harbour, Nova Scotia. At the time his driver's license was revoked. At trial the defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the highway. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving motor vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. HELD: The accused was found not convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended and the charge under s.287(2 was dismissed. The defence argued the words “motor” in s 287(3) do include an electric vehicle and that the accused could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle, or for speeding, or a motor offence since he was never licensed to operate an AT vehicle on the road. The offence was committed while his ATV was registered. The words 'truck' and “across highway” do not appear to include either a vehicle prohibited from operation upon the highway by s. 11. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV because it was a prohibited vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get a license. Under the Motor Vehicle Act an individual driving vehicle upon highway must be properly licensed. It is argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the motor vehicle and the revocation of his driver’s license he should be guilty of this offence. The Defence argues that it is not that simple. The use of motor vehicles on public highways by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be convicted of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type and class for which they could properly have been permitted to drive it on a highway. In s.285(2), the words ""motor Vehicle"" include only those types or classes of vehicles for which one can obtain a license in the city. While note that section 12 of the Off-Highway Vehicles Act permits the operation of an ATVs prohibited from the highway, these provisions are not relevant to this case.","These facts were agreed and the only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his license was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act.

The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.

The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. He was acquitted of all other charges. The complainant testified that she was driving down the road when she noticed that the accused was following her. She described her husband as being aggressive, smelling of alcohol and agitated. She was unable to exit because he stopped beside her. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge correctly identified the law in Saskatchewan in relation to this principle and the trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct, or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently, but whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the decision. 1)The trial judge's decision focussed primarily on the fact the accused overtook the complainant and 'pushed' her to the side of the road. The lack of care must be serious enough to merit punishment. 2)The accused's driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances. The offence will only be made out if the accused intentionally applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant, the complainant did not consent to the force applied, and she was forced off the road to avoid collision. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and re-examined the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that the judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the fact that the manner in which the appellant drove was inherently dangerous. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the Court's decision.","There is nothing in the transcript which suggests the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision. 14: 14 …I am not entitled to re-weigh the evidence and to substitute my own opinion for that of the trial judge.

HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed with written reasons.  1)Not all Canadian citizens have the right to have their children educated in French. Sections 23(1) and (2) of the Charter state that 23.(1) Citizens of Canada (a) whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside, or (b) who reside in the United States, to exercise general supervision and control over French language instruction programs and fransaskois schools in Saskatchewan.  2) Not all Canadians have a right to an education in French, and neither this Court nor the SHRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion.  3) The lawless children's claim should be struck under Rule 7-9-2(e) of The Queen's Bench Rules as an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF, and they consistently referred to the defendant as the 'CÉF'.",0.3903225806451613

The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines.

Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs.

The petitioner claimed an interest in the farming operation which included the respondent's father and mother as well as three brothers of the respondent. The respondent attempted to introduce such evidence through an expert in contravention of the Rules of Court. HELD: The respondent's income was fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the petitioner's adjusted income was $25,721.07. The court ordered that all or part of the capital cost allowance be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the parties to obtain the total payable for the three children. 1) The petitioner was employed and the respondent was unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) he will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The court found that the petitioner was in loco parentis in respect of the farm equipment and that the respondent received the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of the child. The Court found that although the petitioner had only completed seeding on one-third of the land, she was in possession of the other half of it. 3) The Court concluded that the facts justify adding back 25% of the average capital cost on land and buildings, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. 4) The evidence with respect to the remaining issues leaves much to be desired. There is no evidence as to the tax implications regarding matrimonial property. It involves farming expenses which reflect the decreased value of the equipment over time. There are no costs awarded to either party and each must pay their own costs.","[1] This issues for resolution in this trial are:

6.

[14] In addition, the respondent is to pay one-half of the cost of extra-curricular activities as is set forth on Exhibits P-9, P-10 and P-ll, and is to pay one-half of the cost of any future extra-curricular activities which the parties mutually agree upon. I decline to order any spousal support. Therefore, the land described as the SE 1/4 of 11-20-7-W3 has no value for the purposes of matrimonial assets. However, during the course of the marriage a mortgage debt of $24,000.00 was paid off with matrimonial property therefore the parties agree that $24,000.00 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase in the equity in the six quarters. [43] Therefore, the petitioner will have judgment against the respondent for the sum of $113,155.19 less the sum of $15,580.00 (being the value of the assets in her possession) leaving a balance of $97,575.19 to be paid to the petitioner, less one-half the costs of the appraisals.

The Court found that the petitioner had only completed seeding on one-third of the land when the marriage was concluded and that the respondent had paid the mortgage debt of $24,000 and was to have access to the child in their respective percentage based on the Guidelines.","[1] This issues for resolution in this trial are:

6. Division of Matrimonial Property [2] The issue of divorce, custody and access were disposed of by judgments given during the course of the trial by consent of the parties. $25,721.07 Therefore, for the purposes of the Guidelines the petitioner's income is fixed at $11,376.00 per year and the respondent's adjusted income is fixed at $25,721.07.

I decline to order any spousal support. Therefore, the land described as the SE 1/4 of 11-20-7-W3 has no value for the purposes of matrimonial assets. However, during the course of the marriage a mortgage debt of $24,000.00 was paid off with matrimonial property therefore the parties agree that $24,000.00 must be added to the value of the matrimonial property as the net increase in the equity in the six quarters.

Matrimonial property was to be divided, maintenance for the children and spousal support were to be determined. HELD: 1)Access was to be mutually agreed upon with the 18 year old to whom the respondent stood in loco parentis.  2)Expert evidence of tax implications was not called as the respondent failed to give notice as required by the Rules of Court. 3)The mother's annual income for purposes of the Guidelines was fixed at $11,376 not including the $300 child support she received from the natural father of the 18 year old. The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal. Credit was given for the reduction in the mortgage debt by $24,000. There was no interest to be divided in the 1999 crops. 6)The petitioner was awarded judgment for $113,155.19 less $15,580 for assets in her possession and less one-half the appraisal costs. The judgment was to be a charge on the respondent's land.
