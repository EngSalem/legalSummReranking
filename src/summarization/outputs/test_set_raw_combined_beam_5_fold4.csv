3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","An insolvent person applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant opposed the approval of the applicant's proposal on several grounds including that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should be reclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee, which represents 15 employees, voted in favour of the proposal, 2 opposed it, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed the proposal. HELD: The proposed amended version of the proposed proposed proposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and ss.50(13). The court was much in sympathy with the concerns that the objection had raised by the trustee and the submissions made on his behalf at the hearing of the application. Absent the application of the provisions in the BIA to an employer it is clear that an employer’s indebtedness to an employee pension plans does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. With the intervention of the Board of Insurance, and proceedings under the Act as judicially interpreted results in another conclusion (see Re Cosmic Adventures Halifax Inc. (1999), 1999 CanLII 1844; Re Sumner Co. (4th) 22 (N.S.C.))."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced evidence of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the blood alcohol level at the time of the test was different from the time the offence took place. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., did operate a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased aspen logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd., a Wood Products contractor. Wood Products, through its contractor, Logging (referred to as P E) harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the Crown. The defence argued that once the logs reach the company, they have already been processed, and to require the company to have a processing licence is unnecessary. The court found that P & E Logging did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: P&E was found guilty of violating s. 17.2(1)(f) of the Forest Resources management Act. The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. It is not an insignificant process, nor is it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land. The Crown's argument that the definition of'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the logs sold for log homes sell for approximately double the price of logs sold to the Meadow Lake Pulp Mill. However, the Crown's interpretation would create an absurdity in that: one, it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land; and two, it creates a two tiered system of regulation of processing facilities, those that process product originating from Crown forest land and those that only process product from private land."

He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act to obtain information about the Department of Justice's (Department of Justice) counter-terrorism program. At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined all of the accusations made against him. The summary of the alleged abuse was included in the ADR process as a list of any allegations that had been proven to be false. The respondent was also given assurances that his statements would not be circulated elsewhere without his permission. In the course of the process, various individuals and organizations made allegations against him, including the respondent's son, that he had been sexually assaulted by them. He was also cautioned that these allegations were completely and totally false and that his undertakings of confidentiality were extended to all informants. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed. The degree to which the various roles of the federal and provincial government had been meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Justice Minister. In addition, the appellant was awarded costs of the appeal in accordance with s. 41(1) of the Act. The costs of providing the information were awarded in an expeditious fashion."

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking.

HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.

They are the following: he displayed signs that displayed actions that were harmful to the public or the members; and he showed people pictures of aborted fetuses. 3) The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He shouted them at patients or potential patients of the health care facility that they were 'fornicators'. He took photographs of the demonstration. He displayed these signs while taking photographs. He also displayed messages that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids, AIDS, and “Don’t let Planned Parenthood corrupt you”. The statements referenced abortion, drugs, and abortion. These facts supported the conclusion that the applicant was guilty of professional misconduct as described above. The applicant sought a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges on the grounds his Charter rights were infringed if he was picketing Planned Parenthood.  4) The SAPLN takes the position that this Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. 5) Several factors should have been taken into consideration, among which the procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor"

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. HELD: The portions of the affidavit that were objected to were struck. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The addition of the word 'protect' puts the question beyond doubt. If more were needed, one need only note that these statements of account were all directed to the respondent without objection.  1) The respondent was not a solicitor bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. 2) The Court was not awarded judgment under either the General Rules (Q.B. Rule 129) or Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure)."

He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record.

The collision occurred in a construction zone approximately eight kilometres south of Spalding, Saskatchewan. HELD: The Court sentenced the accused to six years imprisonment. The sentences were to be consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction. There was no suggestion whatsoever that alcohol and/or drugs were involved in the offence. The aggravating and mitigating factors outlined in s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code, including driving with more than 80 mgs of alcohol in his blood, were all considered by the Court.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected.

There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises from the common law. The lien entitles the lawyer to keep the client's property or documents from the client. As between the client and the solicitor, the client has no greater right to refuse production of documents on which he has a lien than his client would have if he had the documents in his possession. 2) There is nothing before the court that even remotely suggests that the Jensen is not not the owner of the shares in question. They are his and his alone. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. The client cannot refuse production and delivery to the receiver. 3) The only claim against the shares within the applicant company was the plaintiff's claim as creditor. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor. The claim for lien is not made out. 4) The court concluded that the end result of the seizure and sale of Jensen's shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained. 5) The application to compel the sheriff to hand over the shares is dismissed. 6) The applicant company has no application to the matter at hand."

Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver.

7_2005skqb272.txt,"FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding an un-subdivided parcel of land. The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. The issue arises in a rather complex fact situation. In 1994, the School Division's predecessor (the Kerrobert School Division) sold land to purchasers (the Flads). The transfer was registered, however the reservation of the farm site could not be registered because it purported to effect an unauthorized subdivision of the land. The plaintiff filed a caveat to protect his interest. The respondent took proceedings to lapse the plaintiff's caveat. The matter was referred back to the Court for further determination and assessment of damages. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The orders made in the foregoing cases can only be determined on a full examination of the evidence and not in summary fashion. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in a mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The Flads retained a legal interest in the land which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act. The judge was empowered under s.8 to make vesting orders rather than awarding monetary compensation.  1)The Flads were in occupation of proposed parcel G, using the property as residence and constructing corrals for their livestock operation. In addition to their lack of title, they failed to obtain a development permit before making improvements to the site. As such, some of their subsequent difficulties were of their own making and not solely ascribable to the mistakes of title. 2)When the error first came to light in 1995, the applicant School Division arranged to purchase a parcel from the respondent for $5,600. The application was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. No costs were provided."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for emotional injury as a result of the loss of a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident. She was present although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved. She commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. It was admitted that the Plaintiff was entitled to recover the nervous shock from the Defendant. The Plaintiff did not participate in the trial and has no interest of the outcome, the Facility Association and Wawanesa having together settled her claim. The Court found that such a claim was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Section D provisions of the M/V insurance policy issued by the defendant extend to protect an 'insured person' under the contract.

In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","HELD: The court ordered an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of the applicant’s legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent. The court was not satisfied that the bill rendered by the applicant was an inappropriate and/or excessive bill. The evidence before the court was that the client took exception to the bill, putting the respondent on notice when he received the billing document. The May 29, 2007 account was on the file and had not been previously forwarded. The BASF matter was settled in 2007 and the court determined that it was in the interests of justice to abridge the time and order the assessment.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 Charter rights by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The police had entered the appellant's home after hearing a scream from inside the home.

He alleged that the police entered the home to ensure that there were no other occupants and to ensure he had no weapon.

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 1) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant took exception to being served with what she described as one business day's notice. Since she was not personally present at the hearing, she could not even respond to such evidence or new allegations since she was completely unaware of them. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the tenant's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not a adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3) The notice to the tenant must contain sufficient particulars of the landlord's claim so as to enable the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence.

The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of a doctor, who claimed to be the son of the deceased doctor and sought entitlement to his late father's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached including that proof in solemn form would be required, with the case to be tried by Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, sitting in Probate. Jurisdiction to hear a case such as this flowed from the Probate Act and is based on the historic statutory, common law and equity authorities of the pre-confederation court modelled on the English Probate Court. However, jurisdiction with respect to the relief claimed by the doctor and his wife (in the second and third actions, respectively) was reserved to the SCC. Some of the evidence led in both respects bears repeating as it impacts upon the continuing claims for relief sought by the medical specialist and his son."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies for a declaration that the respondents (Zurich and Sovereign) are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant's legal allegations are properly pleaded. In doing so, courts are not bound by the legal labels chosen by the plaintiff. plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 2) There are situations where a claim can be cast in terms of both negligence and intentional tort. If the alleged negligence is based on the same harm as the intentional tort, it will not allow the insured to avoid the exclusion clause for intentionally caused injuries. 3) The essence of the claim is that the roof of the barn has failed prematurely. It alleges that the proposed Foil Backed Insulation is unsuitable for use in a swine barn. 4) The mere fact that the applicant sub-contracts with the general contractor for the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit do not change the intentional nature of the acts. 5) Occurrence 'Occurrence' includes continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which result in loss neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured. 6) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend has been conventionally addressed by relying on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the form of a statement of claim. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets of construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 7) In this case, the defendants were negligent and breached the contractual and other duties owed by them to Genex. Whether any of the properly pleaded, non-derivative claims could potentially trigger the insurer's duty to defend."

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. Although the court had ordered that the petitioner was entitled to exclusive possession of the matrimonial home, it wanted to specify a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The petitioner was granted exclusive possession. The Court was prepared to provide directions. 1)Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal did not stay the execution of the judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or spousal support for a child or a adult adult. 2)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules: 15(1) which provide that the service and filing of notice of appeal is not stay if the judgment is stayed pending a disposition of the appeal; and (4) Rule 15, which bars the giving of requested directions. No caselaw in support of the position of either could be found. The issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158.

In August 2014, the RM applied for an order declaring the respondent in contempt of court. The respondent applied for the order, which was subsequently heard. HELD: The application was granted and the matter was adjourned to February 2, 2015. The court was satisfied that the respondent has not substantially complied with the orders nor has he done as much as he can to comply. It is not unusual for there to be a genuine issue between the parties as to whether or not there has been substantial compliance with any given order. This is not such a case. The choices made by the respondent have had significant financial implications for all ratepayers of the rural Municipality whose taxes have regrettably but necessarily been used to fund these contempt proceedings."

Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage.

Subsequently, the clause incorporating the clause with respect to spOUSAL support was incorporated into the judgment of the Court. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The agreement was intended to be final. While the income of the applicant has dropped, the respondent's counsel has not established that she cannot be self-sufficient. During at least some of the years since the separation she has been veryself-sufficient and if she has fallen upon hard days of late, the terms of the agreement which limited the payment of support to the 31st of December 1995 appear applicable. There is no suggestion thatthe agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she wassubjected to undue influence or pressure in any way before signing the agreement and was, in fact, advised by counsel before doing so.  2) It was not an instance where costs should be granted and declined to do so. Each party shall pay their own costs."

The court applied an objective test and concluded a reasonable apprehension of bias existed. Supplementary reasons should not be written without a request from the Court of Appeal.","The accused was charged with three counts under the Criminal Code under the unlawful assault against a peace officer and unlawful resisting a police officer. He was acquitted on all charges. The accused appealed his conviction on the grounds that the trial judge based her decision on considerations which were not supported in the evidence. The trial judge then filed Supplementary Reasons which added two additional paragraphs addressing the same factors as the reasons given at the conclusion of the case: the lack of serenity of the courtroom, the accused's sexual reputation and her sexual activity with persons other than the accused; and the fact that there was no one else in the courtroom at the time of the offence. All of these factors together made the decision inadmissible. The Supplementary Reasons add a number of factors about the demeanour of the peace officer that were not contained in the original decision, and in no way has she suggested in her reasons for making the decision that they were based on a racial attitude or predisposition against police officers. HELD: The appeal against the conviction was allowed and a new trial ordered. There was a ban on the publication of the Supplementary Reasons. 1)There was no evidence before the trial court as to the 'prevalent attitude of the day' or otherwise the remarks made relating to the police officers and the accused.  2)The trial judge was instructed to look into the facts before making a proper decision. It was also ordered to consider the totality of the evidence, which was not part of the reasons for the acquittal. The supplementary reasons add a factor of credibility based on the credibility of the witnesses. 3)There is no evidence in the transcript of the actual evidence which was heard on December 2nd, 1994 and following an oral decision on that date, it contains a thorough review of the facts and finding based upon credibility in favour of the accused and the officer. 4)The Supplementary Reasons do not lead to an error of fact. They lead to a respectful and respectful conclusion that the decision was made in good faith and was not influenced by the Crown's or its own preconceptions about the police towards minorities."

The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40.

The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed.

d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The parties were self-represented at a case management conference. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action struck. The plaintiff amended claim to include a claim for damages from overhanging trees on their property and whether the trees invade their yard. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff's counsel disqualified. HELD: The plaintiff's amended claim can proceed to trial. The court can consider the merits of the claim and the adequacy of it. The claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. It is not frivolous or vexatious. The issue is whether this is a case involving the law of private nuisance. Private nuisance is generally described as unreasonable interference with an occupier's use and enjoyment of their land. As rule damages are awarded where roots damage property either by falling onto it, breaking it or hanging over it and causing damage. Damages are not awarded for trivial annoyances unless special circumstances justify it. Nuisance claims involving trees result in damages where the effects are outside whatever is reasonably expected based on community standards. This is a field of liability that focuses on the harm suffered rather than on prohibited conduct. There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on the plaintiff is greater than expected for the community he lives in. Even if the plaintiff could prove the fluff or debris in his yard was solely from the sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient. The argument that the trees are part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood is generally in favour of urban trees is frivolous. It does not apply to this claim."
c_1991canlii4335.txt,"The plaintiff vendors claimed damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The breach of contract by the defendant purchasers had a domino effect as the plaintiffs had intended to buy a condominium and were sued by their intended vendor, who in turn was a party to a contingent real estate transaction. When the transaction fell apart, the female plaintiff broke down and needed medical treatment. For the plaintiffs and awarding aggravated damages in the amount of $1,000 to the male plaintiff for frustration/hardship and $5,000 to the female plaintiff for mental distress/follow up treatment. The court distinguished between punitive and aggravated damages and noted that the defendants' breach of contract did not have to be 'wanton or reckless' for the plaintiffs' claim in mental distress to succeed. These damages arose naturally from the breach and were foreseeable at the time the contract was executed.","The plaintiffs sought damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The defendants had refused to honour a conditional sale agreement made by the plaintiffs and their solicitor. When the plaintiff's solicitor notified the defendants that they were transferring their property overseas, the defendants' solicitor advised the plaintiffs that they would henceforth represent their own interests and identifying their proper address. The plaintiff then considered the conditional sale offer to be a firm offer, but waited until the afternoon prior to the closing to advise the defendant's solicitor that they did not have financing. As a result, the purchase price was reduced to $118,500 and the deal closed on September 14, 1990 at that price. For the plaintiffs, that the defendants had been totally irresponsible in allowing the plaintiff to succeed in their claim for compensatory damages. The plaintiffs suffered significant stress and mental anguish resulting from the failed sale of the condominium property. In addition, the plaintiff suffered significant emotional trauma as a result of the sudden and severe stress caused by the closing of the deal. Awarding $5,000 of the plaintiffs' damages to the defendants, consisting of $3,500 of general damages and $20,000 in punitive damages, were entirely reasonable and may only be employed in circumstnaces where the conduct giving the cause for complaint is of such nature that it merits punishment."

The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found dangerous offender within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(ii) and he should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown called thirteen witnesses who provided evidence about the accused's prior criminal convictions. HELD: The Court found the accused to be the worst offender in the province and that long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. 1) The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence. 2) The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offender designation and there was no evidence of violence to others. 3) The accused was convicted of attempted murder but convicted of assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and of uttering threats to the victim.

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt priority over that of its security interests in two reefer trailers.

The term 'possession' in these sections is not necessarily equivalent to bare physical possession. In the circumstances of the case before me, to deny the respondent priority over Humboltt would provide the purchaser an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air. 4)The applicant was ordered to pay full value to the respondent.  5)The applications were allowed. The applicant is ordered to have its purchase and maintenance of the collateral by another person at the request of the debtor.  6)The purpose of the application was to determine when debtor's possession begins for the purpose of calculating the fifteen days within which the purchase money interest security must be perfected.  7)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.33(2(a) unless that person is a debtor as defined, unless the collateral is collateral as defined by s. 34(1) and unless another person 'obtained' physical possession as opposed to passive possession.  8)There was no dispute that the Associated lease agreements were for more than one year, that they pertain to collateral that does not consist of intangibles or inventory, and that the parties' lease agreements contained an acknowledgement by the parties that the respectivetrailer was delivered to them at the location and on the date set out in the lease."

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction.

Dismissing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the Crown failed to establish that the police officer was engaged in his duty at the time of the assault and had failed to give the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code. The Code requires that an arresting officer must subjectively have reasonable and probable grounds on which to base the arrest. Those grounds must, in addition, be justifiable from an objective point of view. That is to say, reasonable person placed in the position of the officer must be able to conclude that there were indeed reasonableand probable grounds for the arrest, on the other hand, the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and possible grounds. Specifically, they are not required to establish a prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest.""

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff states that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant states that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter. The issue was whether the agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between him and Petrie respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Act have been satisfied. 2) The first telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The germane portions of the conversation were all that the plaintiff could find. It is not only the words that the defendant exchanged that will decide the legal characterization of these telephone conversations question of law. The words used by the plaintiff and the defendant must be considered in the interpretation of an existing contract. There must be an intention to create legal relations, the presence of offer, acceptance, consideration and consensus ad idem between the parties. 3) In this case the plaintiff must demonstrate that, regardless of his response to the package offers, he was able to buy the subject Quarters. He must establish that his formal position was not one of impatience, uncertainty or lack of understanding of the other's position. 4) The court accepts that the defendants were truthful and credible witnesses. Their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process has entangled them in a three and one-half year disagreement, resulting in this lawsuit."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The victim of the shooting applied for release pending appeal. The accused appealed his sentence, arguing that his incarceration was so long that, by the time his appeal was heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. Application dismissed; the onus is on an appellant under s. 679(4)(a) to be'much more stringent' than for an appeal against conviction; given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, releasing the accused would cause unnecessary hardship. The program described by the respondent could provide much closer supervision than J.E.S. has had in the past, and would not cause undue hardship."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children, one of which was born in the course of their marriage. The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support based on the evidence of the petitioner. The petitioner argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Application dismissed; the court has jurisdiction to consider the application for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties' older child. The court found that the respondent’s conduct was blameworthy and that it would not be appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of the post-secondary expenses to be paid by each of the parties."

The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought an accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died in August 1999 at the age of 86.

HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980, began living together in 1993. They entered into a Minutes of Settlement in February 1996. The agreement was incorporated into the Corollary Relief Judgment and the Divorce Judgment pronounced the 24th day of April, 1996. In addition to the spousal and child support payments, the father was to pay the mother $20,000 per year. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The mother was to receive $2,500 per month in arrears until July 2005. The father stopped paying support in August 2005. He requested enforcement of the amount in the original order and she received $10,000 in November and December 2005. She claimed she owed $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. HELD: 1) The father continued to pay support. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Act. 2) The mother received no money in September and October 2005. Maintenance Enforcement began to collect in October and November 2005. In January 2006 the father received $1,000 directly to the mother. He destroyed any cheques she had received from Maintenance Enforcement in the previous amount. They were given instructions to return what they had. 3) The payments to the father were discontinued in January 2006. In August 2005, maintenance Enforcement returned the post dated cheques from the respondent. She alleged that she had no difficulty in the past and would do so again in the future. She also claimed to have been a good bookkeeper. She acknowledged that she spent $450 per month on medications and that it was time that she left the rectory and found other accommodation. She was unable to find employment outside of Nova Scotia. She did not have any savings, pre-separation RRSP's or equity in the home.  4) The family history of the children leaving their mother's care and either moving in with their father or being supported by their father has been discussed and his financial contribution proven. There is no need for the court's intervention at this stage between the father and his children.  5) The parties entered into an oral agreement in which the father provided financial support directly and the mother was responsible for paying the children's expenses under the agreed-upon system.

7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student who is a resident to return to the program, he must first obtain external funding. The College insists that this funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: 1) The student was paid for period in excess of two years while he was suspended from the program. He was placed on probation for a further six months. His third party funding was reduced during the time he was on probation. 2) The applicant requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. There is no dispute that any exception to the policy would affect the integrity of the policy in the future. The fact that the student chose to have resort to the courts on two occasions suggests the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 3) Although the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, it was not clear whether the funding agency had any say in the College's decision to suspend him with pay."

She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties.

The respondent opposed the agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not proven that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to challenge the separation agreement at the time of its execution, and that there was no evidence from the appellant's psychiatrist confirming her state of mind at the relevant time and the probable effect of the medication upon her ability to make rational decisions, nor having established that the proffered evidence could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial, was not an issue raised by counsel."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the cross-appeal dismissal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed by the Union were not defamed by the publication of the grievance. The Union had worked to ensure that the complainant was able to return to a harassment-free, non-toxic workplace environment but was forced to quit his position as Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in order to obtain an equivalent position in the United States. The complainant had been recruited by the union to work in a variety of positions leading ultimately to an arbitration proceeding. The union and the complainant had each prepared a second document entitled Notice Re: Harassment Grievance, which was published on the Union's website. In issue was whether the arbitration board was the type of 'judicial' institution contemplated by the scope of absolute privilege and whether the publication that took place exceeded what is contemplated by absolute privilege. Counsel for the union opposed the union's argument that it was a quasi-judicial institution and that its publications would not have tended to lower the complainant's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. The trial judge correctly referred to the Grant v. Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61 as an example of how the context in which an impugned statement is made is the push and pull of labour relations. The context is the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation."

He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability.

The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused, who was charged with a variety of offences, was found unfit to stand trial pursuant to s. 672.23 of the Criminal Code.

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, Ingrid, the residue of his estate. A few years later, he died in an automobile accident. The couple signed a separation agreement. They subsequently divorced. In the divorce, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement, which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will, nor did it affect the right of the former spouse to take the benefit of the deceased's estate. The executrix applied for a reinstatement of all her rights under the Canada Life Policy, which provided that should his wife predeceased him, she would be the sole beneficiary under the policy. The appellant argued that she could not do so, and that she was contractually bound to renounce the gift. Dismissing the appeal, that there is nothing to be disclaimed by a valid will. In fact, there are several cases which show that the testator's intentions, as expressed in a valid Will, should not be interfered with. The only conclusion drawn from these cases is that the judge erred in law by failing to give any meaning to s. 22 and 23 of the Wills Act, which provide that a person can renounce benefits from the other's estate if they are so bound by it. This is not the case with regard to the gift to the appellant. Both cases are distinguishable. The separation agreement was based on a common law principle and the wording was limited by the qualifier 'can at most take effect' in the section dealing with estate claims and did not permit this conclusion. There is no reference to a will in either case."

Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.

The Chambers judge however gave no valid reasons for the two restrictions respecting the books or records respecting the fishing licenses and vessels but ordered them to be deleted. The respondent has since gone into bankruptcy. He contends that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge is nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The appeal is allowed with costs."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted on a summary conviction charge. The defendant appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case and by failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. There was no evidence that the defendant had followed due diligence procedures in establishing a proper system to prevent their cashiers from selling tobacco to minors and whether they had taken reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system. The evidence showed that prior to the incident, the defendant knew that there were no other possible precautions or actions that could have been taken to prevent the cashier from selling cigarettes to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable measures to avoid the particular event. These offences may properly be called offences of strict liability."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.",The company's assessment for municipal tax purposes of a shopping mall was based on a single agreement featuring a single sale price. The assessment was allowed in part but the company applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal on several grounds alleging error of law. The company's argument that the Committee erred in law in failing to give effect to the fact the City Assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the property even though the sale be part of a portfolio sale that included other properties located outside the Province. The sale price can be used for the purposes of determining an appropriate market adjustment factor by the sales comparison method. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found nothing requiring the Committee to regard for the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information as was relevant and not excluded from consideration by s.172(5) of The Cities Act. The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee.
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, it might assume the parties would jointly be seeking relief, but the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There had not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner had chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs of the application and the court's own costs of filing the material on her own behalf. The Court could not urge the petitioner to seek advice and assistance from outside counsel but could urge her to seek it out. There was no equality in bargaining positions between the petitioner and the respondent. When the parties came to the Court requesting the proposed form of consent judgment, the terms appeared to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of them and the Court must not be seen to legitimatize, condone, condone or acquiesce in acquiescing in the acquiescing acquiescence of the petitioner into the agreement. The proposed consent judgment was clearly improvident. The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. They were content to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. The petitioner's obligation to provide child support would be $88 per month. The 18 year old child would be 18 years old in approximately 18 months time. The economic value of releasing the petitioner from her obligation to pay child support may be less than $1,600 in all. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal was anything but unconscioable and would speculate that at some point in the future, she will come to realize how much she was indebted to the petitioner. The court ordered the use of legal advice and guidance."

Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants in the Halifax fire department was conducted.

The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleges the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain every two years. The applicants sought to have the award set aside on the grounds the employer failed to meet the test set out in the Judicature Act. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Court had jurisdiction over the application of costs in the cause. 2)The application for stay was originally phrased under Civil Procedure Rule 62 and issued preliminary ruling indicating that only dealt with matters before the appeal court and not this court. 3)The present directions with respect to the utilization of the demoted lieutenant in their present positions were to be adhered to, at least in the short run. 4)The Union's position that the costs should go with the matter, alternatively it could go in the fall. 5)The number of people affected was much smaller and will be primarily the seven who are demoted who are now from time to time acting lieants. 6)Individuals who have done nothing wrong, that it is not in the category of irreparable harm, will not materialize in any real measure until after the matter has been heard."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08. The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider all relevant evidence in making a determination that there is sufficient objective evidence for the officer to make a breath demand.  2) On the whole of the evidence, the court is satisfied that the court's standard of reviewing is correctness. The test is whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. On this part of the review, the judge's decision is entitled to more deference and, absent palpable and overriding error, the facts as found by the judge should not be disturbed. 3) The appellant challenges the objective basis for that belief, namely that there wasn't sufficient evidence that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by drug or alcohol.  4) The officer has four and one year's experience at the time of the offence. He was trained in field sobriety testing and whether he had three years' experience. 5) The factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s belief that the suspect had driven while impaired. 6) There was no material error in the facts of the case."

An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.",HELD: The court ordered a Voice of the Child report. The application was based on an alleged change of circumstances which included V. expressing a desire to live full time with R. The parents were both significantly strapped financially at this time and declined to make an order allocating the costs of the report to them. It was to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.

He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon contrary to s. 344 of the Code. A probation order was imposed. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now seeks leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the robbery which took place at a convenience store. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. This was his first offence. He wanted help for his addiction problem.

b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal brought by the trial judge dismissing charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. 2)The Saskatchewan information was sworn in March 2001 but was not available in the Alberta Court when the respondent appeared. 3)The Provincial Court judge accepted the special plea and dismissed the charges. The charges in Alberta were already deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for wants of prosecution in Alberta. 4)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by a respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent in that province. 5)The Special Pleadings were stayed. 6)An appeal of a verdict of guilty or acquitting a person of an offence involving the use of a weapon was not allowed in this case. 7)Although jurisdiction was lost in Alberta, jurisdiction was regained in Saskatchewan by following the procedure set out in s. 485.1 of the Code. 8)The charges had not, in those circumstances, been disposed of by the Court within the meaning of s. 730(3) of the Criminal Code. 9)Had jurisdiction been lost in Saskatchewan, an appeal of the acquit would have been allowed. 10)The special plea was dismissed and the matter was adjourned for hearing. 11)The Crown sought to have the matter recommenced in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction when nothing happened in March, 2001 and the subsequent appearance on May 7/2001. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Alberta in the spring. 12)The province of Alberta did not withdraw or abandon its charges."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 220(3) of the Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The directors of corporations opposed approval of the arrangement on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal of FCC proposed to distribute all of its net proceeds to those of its shareholders who have 'proven claims in establishing their status as Shareholders rather than having portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA.'s rationale for the arrangement was that the Shareholders have already sustained significant loss on their investment as result of the oppressive acts of former management. The plan proposed for the corporations contemplates an outreach or advertising program to be conducted over the next two years with the goal to reach at least some of the missing shareholders. The purpose of the plan is to allow the corporation to dispose of any property belonging to creditors or shareholders who cannot be found. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate and consistent with the broad purpose and intent of the legislation. The court could exercise its power under s. 210(l) while comply with the mandatory direction in ss. 220 and 221. It has a duty to account. The legislation can be read to operate harmoniously and without conflict.  1) The court found no conflict between the power given by the court in s. 192(m) to permit the court to override the mandatory directions contained in s220 and 221 and s220(1) which allows the Court to approve a proposed interim or final distribution to shareholders in money or in property. The Court could order that rather than the real estate being liquidated, it be divided among the shareholders in a specie proportionate to their entitlement as shareholders.  2) There was no conflict with the right to share in the capital of a corporation that has not been disposed of at the date of its dissolution. It was just and equitable that the funds distributed to shareholders of record would be converted into money and paid to the remaining known shareholders. 3) The Court had no difficulty in finding the Supreme Courts analysis in BCE to be equally applicable."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. There are valid reasons for the town employee's suspicions. He was a Professional Agrologist with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Crop Science and was qualified as an expert in the area of plant chemicals including how they are to be used and their effects on lawns and gardens. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame."

HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","Three issues arising from the breakdown of a 4 1/2 year marriage: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: The husband's obligation to support the wife should end; $700.00 per month ordered for another year. The wife's obligation should end in November; $38,600.00 to be divided. 1)The husband was prejudiced by this unnecessary delay by having to continue paying support of $1,500 per month. He was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to s23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 2)The court reviewed the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse when making a support order. Section 15(5) instructs me to take into account the length of time the spouses cohabited and the functions performed by the spouse claiming support. 3)The economic condition of the wife at the time of separation was one of dependency. She had no means to satisfy her basic needs and the husband had sufficient means to support her. She suffered no economic disadvantage from her short-term marriage. The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to them being married. The husband realized no benefit from them and it was illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them. 4)Costs were awarded retroactively to April 1."

Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was put to the Court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the Court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate.

The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it had been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court as a transfer had been made from Youth Court to Youth Court. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court which included the charge of sexually assaulting the complainant. Although the complainant could not remember her age, she did remember two occasions when the accused was out of school and she turned 10 on the first date specified in the indictment. Although one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she could not recall her age or date the offences. The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment.  1)Solving the mystery of the dates of multiple sexual assaults of children over a period of time was not usually of critical importance in this case. 2)The Court of Queen's Bench accordingly had jurisdiction only when such a matter was transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Act."

No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor trailer and another person owned a trailer. The trailer was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. The police observed the accused operating it in an easterly direction approaching a junction of highways 32 and 332. The officer stopped the vehicle and found it was being operated by the accused. No other notice was given to the public or to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. HELD: The accused was convicted of operating an overweight vehicle on a road to which the minister's weight restriction applied.  1)It is mandatory for the minister to give notice of an order issued pursuant to section 35 of the Provincial Highway Traffic Act. There is no evidence to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to be given. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily or any other media.  2)The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise others in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling.  3)The Department of Highways had erected signs warning and advising people that there was an alternative truck route. There were numerous other signs in the area which indicated that the alternative route was available.  4)It was not the responsibility of the local municipality to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the Minister to provide notice of his order but, in this case, the municipality was taken on itself by advising persons in their local area that hauling goods and small signs warning of an 8,000 kilogram weight restriction.  5)Traffic signs were in place along all grid roads leading to and around highway #332. The municipality was given authority to issue permits to persons to permit overweight vehicle traffic at anytime of the year except spring breakup."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The applicant takes the position that it is not the appropriate party to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that does not fully determine the issue. Pursuant to its statutory parens patriae jurisdiction and to its inherent jurisdiction, the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child and to provide independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act and an order was ordered to issue accordingly unless the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, showed cause as to why it was not the proper party to so act. There was no order as to costs.  1)The Minister was right in asserting that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under mentaldisability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the PTA toact as a personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. 3)The Public Trustees best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v. Magiera."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The 12 year old girl and two juvenile offenders who had been roller skating at the Wheel-A-While Family Roller Rink in Prince Albert had been charged with sexual assault. The plaintiff's radio station was investigated and found to be a proven reliable source of information. Records were kept for eight weeks as a result of the CRTC investigation. Nothing was published that was false,malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. The attendance at the plaintiff's station was down for a few days after the newscast came on the air. Employees at the defendant's business were concerned that a sexual assault had occurred at the rink. HELD: The plaintiff had a cause of action against the defendant and the action was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff published the news that it received from the police. Nothing at all pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff in its roller rink operation. The business was on down side at the time. The sexual assault occurring where it did not occur was not the fault of either the plaintiff or the defendant. The defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that the news which were aired would cause harm to their business or to their health.  2)The CRTC did what it was ordered to do and was exonerated by its controlling body, the CCR, for doing so. The court found that the defendant published the information that it receives from the Police. The information was proven correct and it should and would be aired. 3)The plaintiffs suffered a loss of $12,500 due to the sexual assault which had not been reported to the police by the defendant prior to the trial. The loss was further attributed to the failure of the defendant to pursue its statutory obligations under s.8(6) of the Radio Regulations. 4)The court awarded the plaintiff $1,000,000 in damages and disbursements of that amount to the plaintiff corporation.  5)Costs were awarded to the general public."
e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been drinking and was in a motor vehicle accident one half to one hour prior to the attending doctor giving the sample. At trial, the trial judge held the consumption of specific medical information about the appellant without his consent did not violate the appellant's s.8 Charter right. The trial judge then held the obtaining of the information by the police as the basis of formulating the demand was not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of Section 8 of the Charter nor in Dersh, supra where the doctor prepared a medical report in response to a written request by police. When the doctor returned to the hospital after being involved in an accident, a blood sample was taken by the doctor for medical purposes while the accused was unconscious contrary to an explicit refusal by the accused to provide blood sample under any circumstances. This case was substantially different from the case in which the police required no warrant to act upon the information they received from the doctor before they received the information from the agent."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the action was commenced, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court was satisfied sufficient change can occur within the context of an order under s. 37(1) such that it is in the best interests of the child to make such an order. The Ministry failed to show that they had taken measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at the hands of their father. A permanent custody order was granted on the basis of s. 11(a)(1) and (b)of the Children and Family Services Act.  1)The parents had taken an active interest in the children for the past 3 years. The mother had no contact with them since missing her last visit at the end of 2013. The father, once the letters were written, has had no involvement with the children's school or the Ministry. This development must be allowed to continue and that can only happen if he is committed to the care of the Ministry in the permanent capacity. 2)The children were exposed to violence on a regular basis. There does not appear to be any adult person able or willing to provide for their needs. As such, the children are further exposed to emotional and physical harm."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","HELD: The application was granted in the alternative and the plaintiff was required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. The court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. The plaintiff relied on cases such as Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, which set out the principles for determining whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the defendant's head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. There were requests for answers to those undertakings culminating in the application. The stage of litigation is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the court on its own to strike the claim."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay.

Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. It is in the Court's view that the respondent is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year and can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrear. However, in order to allow the applicant rescission, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay the ongoing maintenance payments and secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay them. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrerears, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. 3) There are factors that should be considered in determining the cause of delay in seeking relief from child support. The applicant was stubborn. He earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002 and does not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason. 4) The Court found that the petitioner was being stubborn and that it would not be fair to adjust his payments as they were made prior to the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The petitioner has established the necessary change in circumstance. In order to proceed with his variation regarding his ongoing support payments, would need to determine he has (1) present ability to pay and (2) that he is not presently unable to pay; and (3) the respondent has an obligation, according to the British Columbia Tables, to pay $425 for the one child. The Court held that the Court would therefore adjust the respondent's payments as at November 1, 2006."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his own behalf and by his son-in-law were at variance in material ways. The accused was standing on the walkway at the rear of the seats when the alleged victim, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, approached him and punched him in the face. The victim fell to the ground and remained motionless. Less than one minute later the victim was run over and killed by a truck. HELD: The Court held that the jury must conclude that the accused driving was the contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 1) The Court expressly stated that Nurse was incorrectly decided. 2) While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The defendant placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The Court also held that there was a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the body harm. They are, to quote the Samueluelson decision, 'closely related in time and otherwise'. 3) In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it is very important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable. The assault would deprive the victim of a serious bodily harm, no matter how unforeseen or how unintentional, and the accused is responsible for all of the results of the assault which he committed."

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The Court found that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is not admissible. The Court also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. In reaching this decision, the Court held that the Court could not rely on the standard of proof set out in R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 330, and that the trial judge erred in failing to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible in evidence of any matter may be proved."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment because his prior convictions were not relevant and his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of the prior convictions (such as driving over.08 and failing to stop at the scene of an accident) and he was given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. 2)It is clear that the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an alcohol problem was put in issue. However, the Crown did not object to the questions and the court was not satisfied that they had any effect on the trial. 3)The appellant raised a number of complaints in relation to his cross-examination. He raised questions about previous criminal convictions by the Crown, the evidence of his previous alcohol related offences and the issue of whether he was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. The defence sought to exclude portions of his record on the basis that their admission was more prejudicial than probative. 4)The Court was unable to conclude that the appellant was prejudiced by the questions."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender and that the defendant not be eligible for programing if he had not taken the high intensity sexual offender program. He also argued that the Court was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. Appeal dismissed; the defendant was found not guilty of all the predicate offences and was found to be a danger offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment. The court found that the most important issue at stake was whether the trial judge was satisfied there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community as contemplated by s. 753.1(1)(c)."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and the wife to return to him certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her husband's medical insurance coverage, she needed spousal support because her social assistance disability pension had been terminated when she married, and she wouldn't receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She wanted title to her house back and the home to be divided equally. The husband applied to have the sale of the home ordered on an expedited basis, claiming a reversible error on the part of the Chambers judge in that he had no evidence to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. The court set aside certain provisions of the order under appeal. There was no reason why the matter could not be heard again by Justice Scanlan should his schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within his province and did not require any comment from this Court."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be without tax ramifications to either party. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay and refers to expenditures on credit cards that would suggest the petitioner is able to work full-time and earn an income of approximately $40,000 and child support should be fixed on that basis. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983 and Family Maintenance Act, 1997. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing support of $300. He said he was paying in excess of his legal obligation in 1992 and that in 1992 the payor agreed to pay $300 non-taxable. He did nothing to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 2) The petitioner's farming operation affords him an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the absence of something further the court is not prepared to impute income. 3) Costs: success to have been divided. There will be no order as to costs."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, in a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be planned and deliberate. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. He seeks to set aside the certificate, which has been registered as judgment of this Court, on the same basis that the Court would open up noting for default or set aside default judgment. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The certificate is set aside because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document or, if uncertain, at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. 2) There is no evidence before the Court that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. In fact, what has been tendered as the basis for the Court's discretion in setting aside the director's certificate is an explanation that the handwritten letter to the appellant was sufficient compliance, even though at that time the Director's wage assessment had not yet been completed. 3) The applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to grant the equitable relief requested in this case."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts for medical services provided by the Government of Saskatchewan. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling which held that the Government had not attempted to regulate his pattern of practice by or through the use of the AU code. He argued that the application of the Protocol and the MCIA code in this case allowed the Government to request more information about the services underpinning the accounts and in appropriate situations to deny payment. Both the appeal and the cross-appeal must be dismissed. The principles of the Payment Schedule and its related use are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c). However, the Protocol is not an individualized administrative process and the provisions that are impugned by it do not amount to a unilateral amendment of the payment schedule. Rather, they are part of a wider administrative process designed to facilitate the payment of physician services in Saskatchewan and to allow the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, to look behind the face of the accounts presented for payment."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The defendant applied for an order for summary judgment and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 13.01. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his lawyer's affidavit, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the health of the plaintiff. There is an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the plaintiff's car. There was conflict in her evidence about her depression and other problems she was having with her health. To strike the plaintiff from behind on these facts would contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. Judgement is entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed.  1)It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The court must be cautious in assessing a likely recovery of a plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is a lack of a medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary. 2)The evidence submitted by way of the plaintiffs affidavits causes the Court difficulty. If a defendant's claim is successful, it will depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial. 3)Costs in the cause of the action will be divided equally among the parties. 4)Any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend on credibility and a level of resiliency. A summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application. The Court must exercise caution in assessing likely recovery in early stage litigation. 5)The defendant must disclose the nature of the defence or the issue to be tried with clarity through sufficient facts to indicate that it is a bonafide defence."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. The two older children stay with their mother when they are attending university. HELD: The Court held that it would be in the best interests of the children to be residing in the respondent's home and to have custody of them in the custody of their mother. 1) It was regrettable that it had become necessary for the Court to determine the custodial arrangements for the petitioner and the respondent. However, there is no possibility of reconciliation. 2) The Court reviewed the factors set out in the petitioner's 'best interests' report and found that they would be most likely achieved in spite of the fact that their children were all teenagers. There was little reason to believe that the parties would ever be able to co-parent. 3) The court was required to retain jurisdiction to make final disposition on all corollary issues."

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. The contract contained stringent quality specifications governing the processing of the product which included a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The applicant argued that this was a new matter, not presented by the parties or considered by the Minister, and was not proper consideration on appeal. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and allowing the claim to be appealed, that the province tax authority can only be set aside when a claim has been made for refund under s. 10(1)(h)(I) of the Act. Once it has been established that the machinery or apparatus is used in any degree in the manufacturing process, this is sufficient. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the products, and thus the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the equipment in production."

Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one count of driving over the legal limit in violation of s. 27(5). The accused argued that his Charter rights were breached because he displayed an out of date sticker on his vehicle. The officer had engaged the police lights in the city and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of him. The police officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 p.m. The RCMP were not responsible for policing a particular municipality unless there was an agreement between the province and the federal government. The Crown did not use words that implied derogation from the rights of an RCMP officer who was in the lawful execution of his duty. HELD: The Court held that there was no good public policy reason for the RCMP to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. Even if the RCMP officer admitted that he wasn't acting in their lawful scope of duties and responsibilities when he pulled the accused over, this did not determine the matter of what the law actually was and what the scope of his duties were. 1) The Court found that the RCMP must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not as taking away jurisdiction away from R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. 2) On the facts the stopping of the vehicle was a routine check and the soul purpose was to ensure the accused’s papers were in order and his licence were in place. Once he was placed in the police vehicle, the officer was asked to search the vehicle for open liquor. The Court concluded that this random stop was justified. In reviewing the scheme and object of the RCMP, the Court found the officers were restricted in enforcing the laws in force in any province in that they were given jurisdiction only in relation to provincial laws. 3) The Police Act provides for the use of police officers in any manner connected to the preservation of the peace, the prevention of crime and of offences against the laws of the province in which they are employed. There is nothing in the scheme or object of The RCMP that derogates from that basic presumption. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated that the officers can only stop people for legal reasons and in that case reasons related to driving car such as licence, insurance, mechanical fitness and sobriety."

The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant proposed that costs be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Counsel proposed that the court fix costs in the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements. Counsel's fees totaled $18,705 plus H.S.T. of $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48.

2_2002nspc20.txt,"The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees. A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General of money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS) between the dates of February 16, 1999 and January 18, 2000. There was a dispute between the Crown and the respondent regarding the implication of outstanding bankruptcy proceedings in relation to the issuance of s241(2) compliance order. HELD: The Crown's position was that the authority of the Court to make an order under s232(1) is unaffected by the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Such matters are unaffected by an order of discharge under that Act. The respondent was relying upon an investor and an investor of HRTP S and/or the accountant of that company to make the deductions and necessary remittances. The Crown did not contest this Defence submission relative to the facts and circumstances surrounding the offences. The evidence and submissions did not reveal whether the accountant or investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS. It was submitted that the accountant and the investor were relying upon the same investor to meet the requirements of the Income tax Act including the remittance to the receiver. The implicit inference to be drawn from those submissions was that either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more, responsible for these offences."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The second application was granted in part. The defendants argued that there was sufficient temporal and factual basis between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those that would result in a termination of the order. HELD: The preservation order was terminated and the statement of claim amended.  1)The application to add the plaintiff and the escrow agreement were denied.  2)The court must be satisfied that neither of the defendants will suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The failure to prosecute an action without delay could call for the termination of a preservation order. There are certainly circumstances in which a failure by a plaintiff to prosecute its claim without delay would cause a delay of at least 3 years. However, not every delay meets that mark. The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay, in the context of the legislation, and the applicant's position that the delay is caused by the defendant's failure to enforce his obligations under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Bankruptcy Act. 3)In this case, the plaintiffs chose to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It is their position that this action is totally independent and that even if there is some logic in securing the Turkish judgment before dealing with enforcement, that approach became unacceptable once preservation order with the impact of the Order was in place. The Court must exercise its discretion to order that ABank be added as a plaintiff, and that the Statement of Claim be amended in the manner proposed.  4)The Court must be able to infer from the foregoing that fading memories would have particular impact on the ability of the defendant to respond to this new claim. The necessary prejudice has not been demonstrated. The two conditions specified in s. 20(a) and (b) exist.  5)It is open to the court to terminate preservation order granted pursuant to the EMJA if the applicant shows grounds that would vitiate contract or cause undue hardship. The addition of ABank would not create a wholly new proceeding."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) the Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered to ensure that the evidence does not rest on an error of a reasonable basis."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff has applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc. (Clarke) answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) There is no implied waiver of the litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of a sketch. The Court found that when an expert takes the witness stand or the expert's report is tendered into evidence there is an implied waiver that information in the plaintiff's file which is foundational to the opinion is not an issue. 2) There are several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and CN asks that Clarke answer based upon its current knowledge. Clarke cannot, without significant work that would essentially involve auditing CN's entire claimed expense records, possibly know whether or not the items claimed flowed from the derailment. All of the relevant knowledge is in the possession of CN and Clarke would have had no basis on which to make informed decisions. The request can be made, but it is entirely up to Clarke to decide whether to accommodate CN. There was nothing in Clarke's refusal to answer that was inappropriate.  3) In the context of the former Queen's Bench Rules, absent the emphasis now in the foundational rules on the quickest means of resolving claims at the least expense, Clarke should not be required to answer the question."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the complainant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the complainant as the issues have not been settled.

The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel pursuant to the collaborative Law agreement and ordered that the matter be decided at a pre-trial and trial.

e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads:Article XII - Indemnity Clause CUPE Local 59 shall pay the cost of Defending an action against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union in the course of his or her duties. The Union counterclaim against the plaintiff for breach of the indemnity by-law is part and parcel of strategy to defend the officers who were sued by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 2) The Union submits that there are two key reasons why the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified: the indemnity clause was not intended to be used to initiate actions but rather to defend actions or proceedings; and 3) the plaintiff was not an executive officer at the relevant time or was not acting in his/her duties as an Executive Officer when he made the comments and published the material for which he is being sued. The argument between the plaintiff and Union is even further removed from those which the Labour Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction. 3) This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the LRB. The forum for this contest is the Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff”s claim and his application under Queen Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment."

Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","The accused, who was charged with the charge of murder, applied for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights had been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity generated by the case. The accused had not had the benefit of a preliminary inquiry as a result of the Crown preferring the indictment against him. There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. The defence argued that prejudicial information had been contained in many of the media reports and that the security measures presently in place and focussed on by the media have instilled in the general populous a climate of fear which makes the selection of an impartial jury impossible. The applicant argued that the presence of prejudicial comments and images in the media had created an atmosphere of fear and terror surrounding the accused's trial such that it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial by an impartial Jury. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Court found that it was impossible to determine whether the accused had been prejudiced because of the negative publicity. 2)Pre- trial publicity, filled as it is with prejudicial and inflammatory information, has lead to an apprehension of bias. However, until it is known to what extent this information has affected potential jurors, the issue remains speculative. 3)The application was also dismissed on the basis that challenges for cause were desirable. 4)Although v. Sherratt dealt with violation of an accused's s.7 Charter rights due to non disclosure, the principle enunciated in R. v. O'Connor is applicable to a situation involving an individual's 11(d) and (f) rights. 5)It was not possible to conclude that a reasonable jury had been irreparably prejudiced."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and with intent to commit an indictable offence, having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for more than 10 months at the time of their convictions. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal gave each of them one credit for time served on remand which is 20 months. The sentence which each will serve from this date is two years to be served in a federal penitentiary are warranted in the circumstances. 2) The sentences will not be 2 years or less, it is not necessary to consider whether a conditional sentence would be appropriate. Even if the global sentence had been less than 2 years, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh. 3) The aggravating and mitigating factors included the 13 year old being conscripted to participate in this serious and violent crime, the fact that a high speed vehicle chase ensued after the robbery on a major thoroughfare in the City of Regina, with the getaway vehicle approaching speeds of 100 kms per hour and driving through red lights, innocent bystanders could have been killed or injured. These are all factors which militated against a sentence in the lower range of sentences."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when they jumped from the top floor of a building. The building was essentially a wooden structure with vinyl siding on exterior walls and asphalt roof shingles. The ceiling was completely black with smoke and flames. The plaintiff suffered serious injuries from the fall. The fire alarm system in the building was not working at the time of the fire. The smoke detector in the plaintiff's apartment system was not functioning properly, there were problems with the fire engine system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant's supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire alarm systems that was in excess of 25 years old; there were no beeping noises coming from the smoke alarm system; the ceiling fan did not operate as it should have and the plaintiff was uninformed and unaware that the smoke detector would not have detected smoke and gone off. The defendant breached its standard of care by failing to provide the tenants with adequate warning of the existence of smoke and/or fire. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between landlord and tenant and the tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendant owed an obligation of care to the plaintiffs to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. In order to determine causation, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that negligence caused the injury using the 'but for' test. This would include installation and maintenance of an operational fire alarm."

He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope that he somehow finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future. 2)The student loans represent 100% of the provable claims of unsecured creditors. To his credit the bankrupt paid a total of $6,074.92 toward his Saskatchewan loan between November 1994 and April 1996. Since that time, the bankrupt has been primarily employed as a taxi-driver. He is also single with no dependents. His net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for single person. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge."

The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertakings given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she not be impaired by alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is not enough to prove impaired ability to operate a motor vehicle."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and turn north for short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed the case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. HELD: The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and acquitted him. On all of the evidence, am convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Court cannot accept the explanation offered by the defendant that he was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The terms 'hunting' and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or Regulations. Exhibit P-3, the million candle power searchlight clearly casts a beam of light amply demonstrated by the Agreed Statement of Facts and the observations of both the RCMP and the SERM employees that pulled the defendant over. However, it lacks any degree of probability that the first thought that would come to his mind, when he picked up his son and nephew, was that Mr. Black may have been hurt by a moose. The defendant acknowledged that he had been attacked by moose in the area earlier that day and was seriously concerned that the same fate might have befallen him."

The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson, R.D.G., born December 1995, pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son, P.J.B. HELD: 1 Saturday access period every two months would be appropriate under all of the circumstances. The Court ordered that the paternal grandparents be granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 am to 4:00 p.m. The court was of the view that it would be in the child's best interests to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents and his paternal grandparents. This fact warrants consideration by the court in assessing what is in the best interests of the child in terms of access to that child. 2) The Court was not satisfied that it was appropriate to link the access of the maternal grandparents with that of the father. They are, in their view, separate relationships with unique characteristics to each of them. As their son does not reside in Saskatchewan but rather in Alberta, the Court believed that less frequent access should be appropriate."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with aggravated assault, being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm and being in possession of a weapon which had been stolen from two residences. The accused also had a Grade X education and had sporadic employment over the past few years. He co-operated fully with the police including testifying at the trial of his co-accused. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, followed by a period of six years incarceration. The maximum sentence for breaking and entering a dwelling house under s. 348(1)(b) is life imprisonment. The evidence in this case was that the accused had less than perfect upbringing as a child and had a fair amount of instability in his years beginning particularly when he was in adolescence. The pre-sentence report was sufficiently current so as to provide the required information for the Court to use. Nothing significant had occurred since the preparation of the report except for the accused pleading guilty."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The delay of 17 minutes from the time that the officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle was a violation of Shire’s Charter rights. The roadside demand was not made “forthwith” as required by s. 253(a) and the evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded. In the instant case, it was clear from the reasons that the trial judge accepted the officer ought to have had a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. HELD: 1) There were circumstances in this case that should have prompted the police officer to embark on an investigation of his possible impairment by alcohol. However, what the officer chose to do was have Shire wait in the police vehicle while he was searched, because the search was being conducted at the side of the road. It is implicit in the Charter that there is a breach of various Charter rights which is justifiable if there is no undue delay. If there is undue delay, the breach of these rights is not longer justifiable. 2) The delay in detaining Shire while the police were conducting their search of the vehicle was implicit. There was no breach of the Charter at all."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the home had flooded 12 years ago. Later the Defendants moved back in and the neighbours burned out their shop vac cleaning up water in the basement. This water was coming through under the exterior door, approximately to inches deep and feet in diameter. The door was not sealed properly. When the baseboards were removed, mould was on two different walls neither of which was the furnace room. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall behind the windows. The Claimant requested further investigation. Counsel for the defense made a motion to dismiss the motion. Dismissing the motion, that the test for non-suit is whether the statements made by the vendors are sufficient evidence to show they have a case which is recognized by the law. The Small Claims Court is a court of law school and the principles of law are part of the make up that is imposed upon the litigants and those that hear the case. The court fully understood that the claimant did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims were not present. It was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a Court of Law manner."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The plan was to incorporate new company called 'Geneco.' Gene Putnam died in 1982 and after his death, the three brothers continued to operate the company. They all worked in different aspects of the company and eventually became involved in the management of the dairy operation. Gene putnam sold Fluid Milk Quota (maintaining the value of the farm on a going concern basis) to his brother. The defendant sold it and took the position that it was not obligated to share the proceeds with the plaintiffs. The plaintiff obtained a copy of the documents signed by the defendants. The documents show that the agreement was signed in 1987 and included conditions precedent to the new quota system. The agreement provided that each brother would have the right to have his share of the sale of each quota. In the years since 1987 the evidence establishes that these two quotas separated in that it became possible to sell only MSQ. The defendants sold MSQ and the plaintiff received a portion of that proceeds. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement interpreted as meaning that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987 prior to December 3lst, 2003, it was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. For easy reference, intend to refer to the brothers by name instead of by their respective company name. MACLELLAN, J.: The dispute in this case is about how to interpret an agreement signed by three brothers in 1988 by which they reorganized their father's farming operation. It is the dispute that defines how the agreement should be interpreted to mean that the defendants sold all of the assets in the company which were to be retained by the parent company and not all quota sold. In this case, the plaintiffs are alleging the agreement only refers to Fluid milk Quota and therefore the agreement is not binding. The agreements clearly state that the two assets are to be equally divided and therefore there is no obligation for the plaintiff to have any part of that assets sold. This agreement is therefore not binding on the plaintiff. In fact, it is an agreement that the parties agreed upon prior to the merger that the assets would be divided equally among them. In other words, the agreement has nothing to do with either quota sold but with the"
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault contrary to s. 235. HELD: 1) The Court held there must, at least, be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts. 2) The evidence was presumptively inadmissible. It could be used to show hostile behaviour by the accused that would lead to a motive to kill, or to show that the accused knew the harm was likely to cause death. The evidence had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. The principles of reliability and the principled approach were set out in R. v. Czibulka, 2004 CanLII 22985 (ON C), [1993] 1 C.L.C. (3d) 495 (Alta. C.A.) and the Alberta Court of Appeal (2001) expanded on the concept of threshold reliability and set out a number of important factors which must be considered within this inquiry. These factors included hearsay evidence from the accused to her friends, family and co-workers; the accused's motive and intent to harm her, her statements to others regarding the alleged choking incidents, and the evidence of her prior encounters with the person she had met and the money she received from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board for the sexual abuse."

The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. The respondent was served with the garnishee summons twice. The judgment was registered as judgment for Saskatchewan July 7, 1987. The amount paid out by both garnishees was $383.71. Interest accrued to the plaintiff was deducted from the judgment. There are a number of deficiencies in the procedure adopted including the respondent never being served with a garnisihee summons. With respect to the Lumsden Hotel, there is evidence it was served on two occasions with garniseshee summons, but it paid money into court on five occasions. There has been no application by the judgment debtor to set aside either garnisahee summons or his solicitor, within 20 days after service on the garniselhee, or within such further time as the court may order ex parte. There is a complicating factor because the plaintiff succeeded at trial and recovered judgment from which an appeal has now been dismissed today.

She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment was sporadic and it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month is fair for the current determination of maintenance. If there is a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent.

Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. In 1986 the appellant carried out an intensive and extensive assessment of its total operations with the view to changing its manner of conducting business by way of an agency to offering franchise to business people. That company could not be considered an existing jobber business. The trial judge held that the clause did not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact, which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. The appellant was forced into the position that it had no intention of applying the provisions of s. 4.02 and s. 6.01. With hindsight, the appellant cannot contend that Ritchie's forecast was relieved because of the existence of Yarmouth Equipment. The franchise agreement contained an exclusionary clause which prevented the appellant from disclosing any information about the prospective franchisee."

Application dismissed; although such an application does not have to be heard prior to the closing date, it does have to be commenced prior to that date.","The applicant vendor applied for an order pursuant to the Vendors and Purchasers Act for declaring that the objection raised by the defendant is without merit. The parties entered into an agreement of purchase and sale in October 2002. The agreement provided for closing of the transaction on November 14, 2002. In the event of a written agreement of extension, time shall continue to be of the essence. The application was commenced before the closing date. The closing date will only be postponed if the parties cannot agree on an issue of costs. Application dismissed. In this case, the contract was not completed, but terminated upon the date for closing without extension. The applicant's application was not made during the pendency of the contract. Such an interpretation is too draconian. There may be many reasons, beyond the control of an applicant, why the application cannot be heard before closing. However, it is within the applicant's control to commence an application before the date of closing."
9_1997canlii9803.txt,"The respondents applied for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington (KSS) was a development pursuant to s2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment as required by s9 of the EAA. Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on the appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration of the project was development. The application was deferred to permit the Court to deal with the substance of the matters raised by the parties already before the Court. HELD: The appeal was granted with costs to the respondents. 1) The majority of the facts deposed to in those affidavits are based on information and belief. While there has been some interest in the proposal and local concern about possible environmental effects, those concerns are not wide-spread. 2) The rule is quite clear in limiting affidavit evidence to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove. 3) The affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents are in breach of the Rule and those portions may not be considered. 4) The chambers judge erred in law in granting the appellant standing for the private enforcement of a public right and in finding that the KSS project was not a development under the Act. 5) The affidavit evidence filed by the respondents was based primarily on conjecture, speculation and hearsay with no basis in fact.  6) There was no disagreement on the essential underlying facts as to the potential effects of the proposal on the environment. 7) In respect to the application by HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status it was not necessary for the court to rule on the admissibility of the evidence contained therein. 8) The respondents were concerned about potential changes to the environment likely to be brought on by the intensive hog operation. Yellow Quill First Nation (Yellow Quill) was concerned about the potential danger to the ground water, including streams that feed ultimately into Nut Lake."
7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children. The respondent father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order, the father has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing.HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government of Canada involving his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000 is to be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. The settlement proceeds are to be set at $350."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records to determine whether there were other circumstances in the applicant's life that would place the child in need of protection. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. HELD: The application of Rule 69 is dismissed. The court is not satisfied that the production of all of the orders of production requested will save costs. The higher standard used in criminal proceedings to determine relevancy should apply to child protection proceedings. The nature of these proceedings have very serious consequences for parents and for their children and demand a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding. The criteria for the claim of privilege based on confidentiality are those set forth in Wigmore on Evidence, vol. (McNaughton rev. 1961), and the Supreme Court confirmed that this term has not been defined in Rule 69. The purpose of our Civil Procedure Rules is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. To achieve this purpose, applicants must be clearly identified by providing the linkage between the information sought and the issues in dispute and must be collected by selecting means specifically tailored to produce the relevant information. This may place a greater burden on the service provider than does merely copying all of its files."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.

The title was transferred to both the plaintiff and the third party. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the Realty notwithstanding how it was affixed thereto. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of a realty and the intention was a prime factor in determining whether something that is affixed in realty becomes a part of it. Furthermore, although it was not a finding of the trial judge the manner of attaching the wheelchair lift, i.e. only to the concrete slab, arguably showed an intention that it showed an interest that it needed to protect by notice on the title, or risk losing it, at least as against Tania and Kapronczai who had knowledge of the facts according to the judge. 2)The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which, in their view, gives San Diego a claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the Provincial Court Judge. 3)The three third parties claimed over against them for the claim made by San Diego. The fourth defendant claimed not to have known the applicant and that Tania had been told about the Abilities council's ownership of the chair lift. The trial judge did not accept the fourth defendant's denial that he and Tania knew the name of which was displayed on a wheelchair lift and did so. There was evidence on which he could find as he did."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four grandchildren were named after the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. 1) The written instructions by the defendant to prepare four cheques of $5,000 each for the benefit of the four granddaughters are not a declaration of trust. The plaintiff intended, by her written instructions, to make monetary gifts for his four grandchildren. The fact that the plaintiff did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime is irrelevant. 2) In McIntyre v.

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","An appeal of the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had been served with hearing notice and received written particulars of his claim for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing, the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. He argued that he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child residing with the mother and the father, David no longer lives with either parent. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father has only one source of income, being his new employment position. It would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in excess of that amount when the evidence is clear he will earn approximately $100,000 less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would be able to remit back to the father the overpayment. 2) In light of the fact that the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father given his severance package, it would be fair to have his support continue to be based on an income of that of approximately $300.00 less than what he is currently earning. 3) The severance is included as part of his income. The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be taken into account in calculating child support."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The parties appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. In all of the circumstances, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. However, we do wish to affirm the principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 137 Sask. R. 295 (Sask. C.A.). Another ground of appeal was that the judge erred in finding an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s. 17(6.2) of the Divorce Act by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order, which contained special provisions to benefit the children."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The defendant commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The Respondent did not file a defence and consequently the defendant obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim proceeded by way of argument. The adjudicator found that s. 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to s. 15 of the act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Alberta court."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01 and to bring an appeal from orders made in September 1999 and October 1st, 1999. The Union argued that there was an arguable issue within the meaning of s. 44 of the Judicature Act and that the matter put before the Supreme Court in the initial Ex-Parte Interim Application and placed again on the return date of September 30th, 1999 was a 'labor-management dispute'. The Union sought to be joined as an intervener pursuant to Rule 62.35 or Rule 8. The Court dismissed the application for the continuation of the injunction. In issue was whether other submissions may advance the interests of the association as well as its members and may allow for additional grounds. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Court held that it had jurisdiction to add a party for the purpose of launching an appeal such that it would be 'unnamed persons' who had notice of the action and were not party to the action. 2) The Union did not have the status to file an appeal unless it was first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court.  3) There were no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as a defendant, or as an Intended Defendant under Rule 5.07. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an applicant by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as plaintiff or as defendant on the basis of the inter-parte interim application. In this case the application was referred to the Court of Appeal as an application for joinder as a matter of urgency pursuant to Rules 3.03, 37.05, and 62.31. 4) It was necessary to deal with these applications by first considering the Union's request as an individual or as party on an application under Rule 7 or under Rule 8 and then it would attempt to convince the Court to permit it to continue on the application. 5) Rule 1.05(e)(i) was apparently not relied upon by the Union. 6) Rule 2.04 (dismissal of the application) was not used. 7) There are, to the best of the court's knowledge, no reports in the jurisdiction dealing"

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, but in view of the respondent's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial. The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of [J.S.] and [E.K.] but seeks the return of [C.S.]. The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial. HELD: The children are in the custody of the Department. 1) The respondent shall have generous and flexible access to the children and may consider the recommendations of the officer mentioned in s. 36(2) of the Act. 2) There shall be no home study done until November 26, 2005. The time period identified in the report is May 2004 to November 2006. The recommendation in the interim report is that the child have sufficient interest in [S.

The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.",An application for continuation of custody of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The accused was released pending a full hearing of the application. 1)The Court was aware that there had been a meeting to discuss the conditions of his supervision in the community. The representatives of the Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of this latest decision to make.  2)The accused had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion of his sentence. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence he is serving. This can be a relatively short period of time where the application is brought near the end of the custody portion of the sentence. It is very immediate limitation. There are a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision and are to be taken rarely. There is also a risk that the accused may re-offend if he serves his youth sentence entirely in custody without the benefits of serving a portion of a youth sentence in community under supervision. There was no evidence in this regard.

The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to reconsider the first two orders. The Union appealed. Appeal allowed; order of Chambers judge set aside and matter remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Matthews and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring.

1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child could qualify for assistance, she was not the head of family maintaining a home for herself and a dependent child. Rather, the appellant's parents were the ones who were to provide the assistance. Since the appellant had no independent source of income and was being supported entirely by her parents, she did not qualify as an expectant mother. The Court reviewed the various types of municipal assistance policies and found that both the Appeal Board and the Social Assistance Appeal Board erred in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance. Allowing the appeal without costs, setting aside the decision of the learned Chambers judge and any order based thereon, and remitting the matter to the Department of Social Services for a review, that the appeal should be allowed without costs."

HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim.

The appellant contended that the plaintiff's claim was fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award and that the respondent challenged the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The respondent then stopped payment of the same with a claim of set-off being advanced.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse that morning until his sister was able to arouse him and he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. The facts were very different from those in the case before and the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society as described in ss. (2) and (3d) 1. It was difficult to understand how a person who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sex that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina and how that could have taken place. But no evidence was tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the accused's testimony, nor was there anything in the evidence of the witnesses who were called by the Crown."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. The picketing prohibition term of his release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. He sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The existing order stood.
b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given inthe examination for discovery of Krake and ordered that the documents be of minimal use, even of no relevance, in resolving the issues raised by the pleadings. The relief sought was that portions of the documents should be properly described and identified in the defendant's statement as to documents. This need not necessarily involve document by document listing of documents that will be involved. Item 5 became redundant. There was no basis for a pre-trial conference until the action was ready for trial."

The monies paid into Court before this Rule 15 application launched will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. The appellant's non-appearance at the hearing did not have the benefit of any evidence or submissions from the appellant. The judge decided the application on the evidence before him.  1) The appellant might well have brought an application in Queen’s Bench under rule 271. Any verdict or judgment obtained, where one party does not appear at trial, may be set aside by the court upon such terms as may be just, upon an application made within 15 days after the trial. This would have been more expeditious procedure. 2) The appeal that can be expedited is made under rule 15 with stay granted to all matters relating to this matter except for the enforcement proceedings.  3) There is no evidence of personal service required in this case. The respondent took enforcement proceedings and the appellant did not appear in chambers on the return date of the application for variation. He took the position that personal service was required. He also questioned the validity of service by mail, which he designated as his address for service upon electing to represent himself. Whether the appellant was validly served under the Queen”s Bench Rules is an issue that will have to be properly presented and determined by the division of the Court hearing the appeal on the issue of the matter."
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(b) were infringed. HELD: The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. The accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact that person and was subsequently advised of his right regarding counsel and the warning. He did not express any dissatisfaction with his contact with counsel and was not required to provide a statement to the police."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interim injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a subtenant. The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining REAL from interfering with the defendant's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises including the Jubilee Building as tenant from and after September 1, 1996. REAL was not aware of the sublease and was not asked to provide its consent, as required by the lease and the first sublease. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had a strong prima facie case and, in the circumstances, it would be inequitable to permit the landlord to rely on the failure to give written notice as required in the lease. There were no negotiations between REAL and the defendant. There was no promise on the part of REAL that it would follow up on these discussions, nor was there any discussion about waiving any requirements with respect to its exercising the option to renew either through the defendant or directly. The burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer by the refusal is greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted lies on the plaintiff."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order (which was amended on a couple of occasions) for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House Inc. Mr. Potter applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails, documents and other information obtained during the investigation to him. In this application, he alleged that a large number of emails, including those obtained in his own email box, had been wrongfully obtained and that he should have access to virtually everything the investigators had obtained. He also alleged that the Commission used privileged material for the purposes of its investigation and may have handed it over to the RCMP, thereby undermining the process. The application for a stay of the judicial review application was dismissed. The court found that there was no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order disclosure. There were many administrative and practical issues to be addressed, such as how the investigation should respond to the risk that privileged materials have been obtained, how the materials should be dealt with in the interim and what disclosure should be made."

The finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident had taken place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to have the parties share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent had since unilaterally moved the children to Bridgewater, one hour from Halifax, changing their school, changed their after-school care and added one week's block access to the children. There had been some history of access difficulties between the parties and the respondent had significantly altered the children's ability to exercise access as ordered by the previous order. The parties agreed to vary the existing order to reflect their current income and that it was in their best interests to be in the primary care of the father. The children's extracurricular activities were to be suspended during two weeks of block holiday time (see Gordon v. Goertz). HELD: 1) The children were school aged. Their school and after school care had been changed once already in the past few months. 2) The respondent will make a contribution to child care based on her income of $15,888 as disclosed by the documentation before the court and his of $33,996. She will contribute 30% of child care costs, slightly less than the actual ratio of 32%. 3) The existing child support order was terminated as of January 2005 and replaced by one that was continued in the Halifax municipality until further order of the Court. 4) The parties had attempted to focus on the best interests of the child, not the interests and rights of the parents. 5) The Court varied the existing Order for child support payable by the respondent to reflect his current income. His current income, which was approximately $30,000 at the time of the original order, was $25,000.

Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a sentence for the accused. The Crown and the youth court argued that the conference should not be open to the public or the media. Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) requesting that the court include the media and the accused in its decision-making process. The applicant also sought to exclude members of the media, especially the media of colour, from attending the conference. Application dismissed; the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law is an extraordinary remedy and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion. The open court principle is not absolute. It is subject to the considerations set out in s 132 and in the Dagenais/Mentuck test. The court reviewed the various types of conferences and determined that the most common of them was the 'professional case conference', which was to be held in open court. The purpose of the conference was to provide recommendations on sentencing, which was undoubtedly part of the court process; and the 'open court principle' as developed by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Queen's Bench test applied to all discretionary court orders that limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid and further agreed 'the said payment shall continue until the wife remarried or died, whichever date occurs the sooner'. The agreement provided for an annual adjustment to the amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband had always earned a considerable income although he deposed to substantial business investment losses in the United States. He had a locked-in pension with an asset value of $215,000 and house worth approximately $126,000. He married approximately two years ago. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support. The variation application was dismissed with costs to the respondent."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application was made twofold. Firstly, that the bankrupt received wrong legal advice concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly, that he thought the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The court has carefully reviewed the decisions relating to this issue. 2)Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application to annulate the assignment. However, the majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If, as the bankrupt states, an annulment of the assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain of the builders' liien claimants had already commenced an action."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The plaintiff argued that it was a conditional sales agreement and that Case Credit's right was restricted to repossession and sale by s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The issue was not plead in defence but rather in the framework of a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, purchase of equipment, realize on security and retail sales contract. 2)The Agreement has many of the attributes of a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by The Saskatchewan Farm security Act would the defendant be released from all liability. 3)The trade-in as the advance payment was a nominal amount but in the absence of evidence it was not a substantial sum as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. The Agreement does not determine the market value at the end of the Agreement in June 1997 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair market value in June, 2002 or equivalent to it, or more."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The Chambers judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's ultimate remedy should lie in damages, as opposed to specific performance, and urged the respondent to file its statement of defence and proceed to resolution without further delay. The order was immediately registered in January 2007. The condominium plan was registered in or around August 2007. Title to Unit was transferred to the third party purchaser on October 9, 2007. There were two grounds for appeal: 1) the appellant possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel because he will never be successful in obtaining from this Court the remedy of specific performance (the remedy of a specific performance) for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 1993; and 2) the Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registryable interest. It remains only to consider whether the purchaser purchased a proposed condo unit which is not in existence now and never will be. The transaction of purchase and sale may never be completed. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of proceedings."

If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons.

(2) The sentencing judge failed to meet the statutory obligations of this type of offence. The maximum sentence that can be imposed is 15 years imprisonment. This type of sentence represents a serious breach of the victim's financial and emotional health.

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, he considered her factual findings entitled to deference. The trial judge's decision was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It is not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The appellant admitted she did not know what type of footwear the appellant was wearing. The defence made the point that if he had been wearing flip flops, that footwear may have caused him to walk awkwardly or stumble, but there was no evidence he was wearing flip-flops. 2)Although there can be no doubt that the existence of reasonable and probable grounds is grounded in the factual findings of the police officer, the issue of whether the facts as found by the court amount at law to reasonable and likely grounds is a question of law. It was not clear if the appellant's operator or had care or control of motor vehicle (aside from his cleft lip) or whether she should use an ASD. 3)The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn't make observations or truly act upon them. The video confirms that she was correct in most of those observations. The subjective element in determining whether a person has reasonable or probable grounds to make a demand for a sample is not present. 4)The appeal was based on the evidence of the officer. The verdict is unreasonable and beyond the range of acceptable grounds. The officer's evidence is based on observations made while she was at the location of the arrest with the appellant in the police vehicle and the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the indicia of impairment. The evidence as a whole provides ample evidence to support her belief the appellant is operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. 5)The court found with respect to the issues that it addressed in R. v.

5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his section 7 rights. The voir dire resulted in the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief that he was reporting the accident promptly. The officer concluded that the accused understood his rights, the warning and demand for the blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout'. However, he had no recollection of the officer ever placing him under arrest, giving him the warning or making the blood demand. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC, 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321. The Crown concedes the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident. If the accused believed he was Reporting the accident when he gave self- incriminating statements, then the law requires the law to exclude those statements. Evidence obtained though process of self-rimination will generally be excluded in order to ensure the accused has a fair trial. The fair trial test tends more towards an absolute rule of exclusion because courts are instructed not to concentrate on the motives behind the Charter violations. The case before us, the self referencing statements that were made under compulsion of statute have been excluded. However, the evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, must now determine if the evidence so gathered must be excluded from the trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. This is a more difficult decision than the one made in Stillman, at paragraph 110 where evidence would not have been discovered in the absence of the conscription, its admission would render the trial unfair, in the circumstances it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions under the compulsion of a statute."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. The evidence implicating the appellant in the murder of Mr. Byer was that of his former common law spouse, Susan Saxon, and his friend, Dwight Windrum. The appellant had retained different legal counsel for his appeal. The appellate counsel gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning based on the exchange that took place at the pre-charge conference. The issue was whether it was an error of law on the part of the trial court to refuse to give a warning regardless of the stance of the appellant's counsel at the time of trial. A) The credibility of an impugned witness and the importance of that witness's testimony to the Crown's case are the main considerations in assessing the relative trustworthiness of this type of witness. B) The evidence given by a witness whose credibility is inherently suspect, or who is for some reason unsavoury or disreputable, may give rise to a high level of concern and warrant 'caution'. In these circumstances, trial judges must give strong consideration to instructing the jury about the dangers of relying on a witness's unconfirmed evidence and explain to the jury why it is dangerous to do so without some corroborating evidence. The trial judge should not interfere with the credibility of Crown witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to the court for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to pay $20,000 for expert costs. The plaintiff counterclaimed for $25,000 and the counterclaim was dismissed. HELD: The court held that Rule 539(c) should not be invoked. 1)The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for Security for costs. 2)It is clear that the defendant is called upon to defend the within action brought by the plaintiff. This is case where the plaintiff not only is a non-resident party but there is a real likelihood that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful. 3)An order requiring security for cost will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against the countercharge if the security is restricted to the costs for the defence of the claim proper. 4)In the circumstances of this case, the defendant commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. It is reasonable to expect that the plaintiff will be treated as a plaintiff by virtue of the fact that the claim is not wholly distinct from the one it is trying to defend. 5)The plaintiff has commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99) wherein $50k is posted as security for Costs. That was the result of a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff’s opportunity to defend a claim. 6)Costs of this application will be in the cause. 7)There was no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue. Specialty Steels filed pro forma bill of costs showing total costs of $139,900 made up of fees of $39,900 and disbursements of $100,000 which suggest discretion rather than an absolute rule. 8)A counterclaim exists which allows the defendant to use the same mechanism to substitute a trust fund in this court in place of the lien. The amount in that trust fund is approximately $2,000,000 of which is part of the total cost of the action. 9)A party counterclaim is a class action which arises out of a same matter or transaction as the claim.

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action.

The jury may be advised of the prior accident, the date of the accident and that the accident was settled, and the action discontinued. The applicant may introduce her prior medical records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as tonotice and admissibility. In that respect the applicant may choose to require the medical witnesses in question to appear in person, subject to usual rules for costs.

HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution. 1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code. There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years for the offence. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the case. HELD: A lower sentence was justified. A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A three year threshold sentence was imposed pursuant to s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community.

The accused's mother tongue was French and the failure by the judge to advise him of his rights to trial was not a procedural error. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)Language rights are not negative rights, or passive rights; they can only be enjoyed if the means are provided. 2)The trial judge had no discretion and therefore was obligated to put the unrepresented appellant the right to be tried in both of the official languages."

The defendant sought general and special damages and costs. The parties cohabited for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was employed as a medical records techinician. For most of the years they lived together, the plaintiff paid all of household expenses with the exception of the mortgage on the property held jointly with the plaintiff. For the four years between their separation there was a dispute about the value of the plaintiff's property. The respondent, who owned thirty-one residential rental properties in various locales, acquired another six properties in his name and purchased one in Mrs. Keddy's name. For four years the parties resided in a mobile home with their three children from a prior marriage, which was subject to a mortgage, which allowed him to save money to reinvest in his business, and for four years they resided in another home which was not presently in their joint name. The petitioner earned $17,409 per year. The court found that the respondent's income from all sources was $62,856 consisting of $39,276.00 net rental income, $9,726.000 net employment income and $13,854.00 interest income, and that he had minimal involvement in the business.

Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed.

The probate court judge found that in 1993, the deceased withdrew $80,000 from the account and placed it in an investment certificate in the sole name of Ms. Akerley rather than her own name or in their joint names. The funds were to be paid to the joint account and, on maturity, transferred to the estate. The estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility; the evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him.

Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure.

For the past two years, his condition had worsened. He spent six weeks in the Rehab Centre, which he now resided in. He suffered headaches, blurred vision and vertigo. Depression and anxiety led him to focus on his computer skills. He developed a colored brochure that he would test for three or four months and then switch to a parcel approach.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska was 'patently unreasonable'. She noted at the beginning that the decision was based upon an interpretation of the collective agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and restoring the appeal, that the Chambers judge's decision was the only one the Court could reasonably bear, and was not patently unreasonable.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to that of the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, C.L.1(LTA) and the application OF s.54 of that Act. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the mortgage interest was an unregistered interest and that permitting the respondent to enforce the covenant to postpone contained in the Grant Agreement between the appellant and the respondent violated the principle of privity of contract. The fact that the respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the appellant did not change the nature of the interest created by the mortgage. 2) The respondent obtained priority over the appellant by virtue of the filing of its caveat. 3) The appellant knew that third parties in the position the respondent did and would place substantial reliance on such subordination provisions did not have priority. The appellant could not, simply by registering the mortgage, create an interest greater than that to which it was entitled by the agreement. 4) The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs to the respondent in the amount of $6,000."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

The three accused admitted to the offence and gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to re-offend. The 9-1-1 recording brought home what was happening during that short but intense time period.

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. Both parties sought exclusion of the public on the date of the hearing and a publication ban. They recognized that some of the documents in the file may be disclosed if they are entered as evidence during the hearing or referenced in the decision of this court. Allowing the application, that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft, that this is a public interest of superordinate importance and society values prevention of identity theft. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicates it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term of one year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the Fixed Term of One year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012.  2) The fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a Fixed Term. The decision to not advertise the unit for rent was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of the macro decisions can be attributed to the respondent. To put the matter in perspective, if the appellant had not chosen to make the change to furnished premises and had simply waited until November to start advertising the suite for rent, and had then waited until January to re-rent the unit, he would have been dismissed."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or for the purposes of breaching his Treaty right to fish for sustenance in accordance with s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by the regulations, and if so, did the regulation violate his Treaty rights? HELD: The accused was found guilty of the actus reus of the substantial charge. The evidence at trial was that the co-op, with the authority of the provincial government, managed and had sole discretion in determining who got a commercial fishing license and that the regulations could not be saved or justified by the test set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada in Sparrow, 1990 CanLII 104 (SCC), [1990] SCR 1075. The Court found that the evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence and that if the regulation did violate the accused’s Treaty right, he was entitled to a stay of the charge. As the accused stated in his evidence that he was aware of the conflicts he faced in relation to the wording of the “this will mean the closure of Jans Bay and the Narrows area from all fishing all year long”, the Court found he was guilty of both charges."

The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

The accused asserted that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery but that his girlfriend was there. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The letter was not an alibi. It was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate a alibi by perjury. 2)The accused expressly said in his letter that he wished somehow the Crown could proof [the accused] wasn't at Eureka, or that he had been there when the robbery occurred. 3)The evidence drawn against the accused was that he did not meet the onus on him to prove his innocence. 4)His failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry (eight months after the robbery) and at trial (eleven months) did not give him a reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up three and one-half months later. 5)It is understandable that the accused did not observe the accused prior to the robbery. His attention was directed primarily on the robber's face and knife. 6)There was no other explanation for the request for the false evidence to be given.

HELD: An increase was warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal and support were varied to $3,500 per month, continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order and in the amount of $1,000. The wife's request for a 50% increase in support was denied. 1)The company's retained earnings, year by year, were $6,000 lower notwithstanding the assertion that corporate income declined sharply that year. The fact the husband has a new partner who pays him rental income and that certain of his expenses for travel and auto expenses are now paid by the company. 2)There was no independent verification that the shareholders bonus must be repaid, or that they are being retained in the company, nor were the non-recurring WCB refunds sufficient to support the claim."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' for approximately ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant and respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was present during the hearing of the appeal but made no representations. 2)The application was allowed. The Court assumed the facts as set out in their respective affidavits and concluded that the applicant's s. 15(1) Charter rights were infringed and that the infringement was not saved by s. 1. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the conclusions drawn by the Chambers judge were analogous to those reached by the appellant on the basis of the equitable distribution of the assets between the parties. 4)The appellant was awarded costs of the application. 5)The applicant was awarded general damages of $50,000, $60,000 and $70,000. 6)Costs of the constitutional challenge were awarded in the amount of $45,000 to the respondent."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys had special needs and were developmentally delayed. Their mother opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the grandsons to their care, alleging that they were being sexually assaulted by their maternal grandparents. The mother, who was receiving Social Assistance, sought custody of the boys. The father was convicted of welfare fraud. He was sentenced to 21 months and 3 years probation. HELD: The children were placed with the Minister until the age of 18. 1) The court found that the father had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality, which was confirmed by the Court's own investigation of the cases. The evidence showed that the accused regularly walked around the house nude and masturbated with the door open. He did not have a medical marijuana licence. All the children had some type of special needs. They were exposed to sexual activity by their parents. The Court found that most of the time the boys did not masturbate in front of the girls. It concluded that the evidence concerning the boys' continued placement with the parents was unreliable. The court ordered a permanent custody order.  2) The Court ordered the removal of the children from the care of the maternal grandparents and placed them with the paternal grandfather. The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. If a child is found in need of protection, the Court is required to look firstly at s.37(1) which requires a determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the minister for a temporary period not exceeding 6 months. There is no evidence of violence between the parties. The photographs were found to be of young women in various stages of dress and undress. There was no evidence that the parties or any of their children were sexually assaulted. There were no allegations of sexual assault or threats of violence directed at the parents. In fact, there were a number of incidents that the Court was convinced were welfare fraud, such as the sexual assault of two young girls (ages 8 and 11). The Court was of the opinion that the abuse occurred because the parties were close to each other and there was no touching on the part of the accused who had a younger sister who was also sexually assaulted and the fact that his daughter was 13 years old at the time of the offences did not disqualify him from custody.

c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: (1) unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; (2) unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000 knowing that all of the property was obtained directly or indirectly for the purposes of trafficking; (3) having a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to traffic; and (4) having qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The Court found that the aggravating circumstances in this case were that the amount of cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. Cocaine is recognized as a 'hard drug' and it is generally recognized that it is addictive and can create serious dependancy. While young persons were present in the trailer at the time the accused was arrested, there was no evidence that the drugs were received from the accused."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be a variation of the custody order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrears of child support. 2)The mere passage of time would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The fact that the respondent was 15 years old at the time of the 1995 judgment did not disqualify him from the application. 3)The petitioner was to have her annual income of $9,383.00 be increased from $250 to $350.00. 4)The Court dismissed the respondent's application to vary custody. 5)The present application was without prejudice to the petitioner to bring an application to variation with respect to the same relief if supported by the appropriate financial disclosure and documentation. There were no costs awarded."

Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","Following the completion of the plaintiff's civil trial by judge and jury, counsel for the defendants presented a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. The rule provides that the defendant may without being called upon to elect whether he will call evidence, move for dismissal of the action. HELD: The application is dismissed and the defendant is entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the rules with respect to offers of settlement are applicable. 1) There is no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a conclusion on this second most fundamental issue of the case. The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation, applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non susuit. The jury therefore has no evidence upon which they could possibly render a competent verdict upon the disparate facts relied upon by the plaintiffs in the evidence that she and her husband gave at the trial.  2) The plaintiff's claim and the evidence she did present at this trial dealt with the very complicated and difficult issue of whether the duty of care owed and the breach of that duty by the defendant lawyers in respect of the preparation for and conduct of plaintiff's trial in what is known as a prosecution for quasi-criminal statutory offence(s) (Ries Estate). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and judgment including knowledge of the legal rules of admissibility respecting the evidence of witnesses, the identification of legal issues likely to be raised at trial, the appropriate strategy to address those legal issues and the judgments and decisions taken in pursuit of that strategy all are complex and important professional judgments to be made by the trial lawyer."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.",HELD: The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence as truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which excludes hearsay evidence. Evidence was then called on voir dire. The Crown found that the complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial. The statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile.

SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant sought an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agree the exhibit is now under the control of the Attorney General and it is the appropriate respondent. HELD: The appropriate court to determine the issue of access is the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. The court is of the opinion that public access to court records is in favour of public access and the burden to the contrary lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. McIntyre v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) 1982 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 175. There is an appropriate balance of interests and interests for the applicant, especially in view of the extensive file of conversations that had been obtained by the warrant. The CDROM was filed by the Crown in its sentencing submissions and was entered by the accused on his own premises and own leisure. It would be appropriate to view and listen to all the conversations on it.  1) The applicant was granted the requisite hours of business activity and access to its own devices and devices. 2) The admission that the applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of theCD-ROM because Mr. Jones entered guilty plea. 3) The journalists had access at their own homes, own leisure and were able to utilize their devices and utilize their original interests and needs during business hours and should be permitted to attend their business and attend their own business hours to hear and view the evidence.  4) The court was aware that the Crown had an interest in allowing access but it was not entitled to mandamus or declaration."

The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act. The Ministry’s position that the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either of the parties. The evidence showed that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of stability that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.

HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The plaintiffs claim their damages are set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall. The general contractor denies his workmanship was poor, that he was not allowed to finish the job, and that his tools remained at the plaintiffs' property for several months after he was terminated. The plaintiff counterclaims for the cost of the work, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend court and compensation for lost use of tools. 1) The plaintiffs were awarded judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the damage caused by the defendant. The defendant was found to be entitled to judgment for $4,822.00, $580.00 of which is attributable to the countertop replacement and $400.00 to the general contractor. 2) In this case, the defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, there is nothing to suggest it was malicious, oppressive or high-handed, such that punitive damages are rationally required to punish or deter. The objective of punitive damages is to punish the defendant rather than compensate plaintiff, whose just compensation will already have been assessed.

5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. The accused alleges that the Crown breached its agreement to allow the indictment to be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, who was re-elected to be tried by judge and jury. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Crown was not bound by the findings of the trial judge but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now did in the amended indictment).  2) In light of the new indictment, the Crown chose not to appeal those findings. 3) The application to quash counts #1 and #2 raise substantively the same question as that considered and determined adversely to the applicant first by trial judge Goldstein and then by Matheson J. (appeal to the Court of Appeal dismissed). 4) In some cases the Crown concedes that in relation to some of the matters which may appear to make findings favourable to the accused, it is important for the Court to recognize that, because the accused was not at jeopardy in the Schafer trial and his guilt was not in issue, the Court would not necessarily have pursued or emphasized those aspects that also proved the nature or extent of the accused's involvement. 5) In relation to the first count, the applicant reasonably expected the Crown would carefully consider those findings and reassess its position in light of them (i.e. the Crown was simply not seeking investment advice from Peat Marwick and ICC's auditors). The Crown agreed to this procedure and indicated that it would be beneficial to both the Crown and the applicant to have the findings in the current indictment reflected in its case."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada. [2] The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. Given their testimony, the application of the principles of W.(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] SCR 742) is a major element of this case. More detailed analysis of their evidence is required."

The proposal was not properly approved by the creditors in accordance with s. 54(2(d) and the requirements of commercial morality. 2) The proposal is primarily calculated to benefit the Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors of the corporation and not the general body of creditors. 3) The evidence presented to the unsecured creditors was sufficient to enable the Court to reject the proposal. 4) The Court must consider not only the wishes and interests of the creditors but also the conduct and needs of the public and future creditors. 5) The applicant's proposal was essentially nothing more than a 'holding proposal'. 6) It would be impossible for the creditors to terminate their relationship with the plaintiff at any time which would effectively put an end to the plaintiff's ability to sell or lease or lease products that the plaintiff had categorized as security products for the purpose of selling or lease."

Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

The respondent's assets then, and at their time of application, were greater in value than those of the petitioner. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1) The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: 1-half of the values of the condominium, one-half the furniture, vehicle and camper; $54,000.00. There was no conflict in the evidence as to the parties' verbal agreement that they would 'each would own what they have'. 2) The respondent was not required to pay all of the household expenses and her share of vacation costs, which were paid by the respondent with the exception of the odd grocery bill, for the marriage. The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together.  3) The court was not satisfied there was any 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the valueof the family home from being divided equally between the parties. 4) There were no costs to the petitioner in the circumstances."

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

The learned trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside. 1) There is no rational basis to conclude that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at a substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two or three lanes it had to travel before leaving the pavement. 2) The trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that Fleury could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told the trial judge. It seems unlikely that minivans could make that right turn at substantial speed, without leaving the tire tracks. It was the defence's theory at trial, and Fleury's unwavering statement that he was travelling south on Highway 2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and swerved to miss a deer that had come onto the highway. 3) There was no rational conclusion to be drawn from the accident scene, only from the general reconstruction of the scene and from the evidence available to the Crown.

The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","HELD: The Court found that both the accuseds were sexually assaulted by the accused.

The Crown requested a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e). The accused agreed to the sentencing hearing. The accused's conduct was not an isolated incident or even restricted to few occasions. The evidence established that the abuse occurred over several years, many times, and that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just over their clothing. There was no medical evidence and no corroboration of digital penetration. The first aggravating factor the Crown asked the Court to find was the frequency of the assaults. HELD: There are three aggravating factors the Crown must prove. 1) The sexual assaults were numerous.  The accused touched both the victims' skin and touched their bodies.  2) The Court was satisfied that the physical contact was frequent. 3) The accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principal mortgage brokers, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws in a particular manner. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff sought postponements of the mortgage advances in order to permit sufficient funds to be paid in due course. The defendant, who was retained by the plaintiff to act as general counsel, requested that the mortgage draws be confined to four or five draws to ensure that everyone got paid. The first two mortgage draws, which the plaintiff had received in early 1986, had resulted in a substantial shortfall of funds, causing the project's creditors and suppliers to concern that the project was in danger of collapse. For the plaintiffs, that the defendant was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the first two letters of direction and that he broke the undertaking contained in that acknowledgement. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The defendant was found to be a conscientious solicitor, always attempting to be in strict compliance with the terms of his retainer and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients. 2)There was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. 3)The plaintiff's claims were separately argued with regard to negligent misrepresentation and breach of undertaking. The subsequent issues of knowledge, reliance and causation rendered it appropriate to consider the various issues in the plaintiffs' claim together. Any claim under breach of trust could not succeed on this ground."

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 718.2 of the Code are summarized in this sentence: a global sentence of 15 years to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.  2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. He displayed no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. The accused was sentenced to 11 years less credit for his remand time than was imposed for the previous offence of manslaughter which was a 1 year concurrent sentence to an 8 year sentence for manslaughter.  3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel which resulted in a sentence of 6 years, 5 months and 8 years of sentence, respectively. The Court found that the evidence showed that the accused had previously overcome his demons with alcohol and drugs, had temporarily overcome those demons, and was very remorseful at the time of the offence. It was not necessary or appropriate to impose a concurrent sentence of 1 year to the 10 year sentence the Court had imposed for manslaughter, nor was it necessary to tie the hands of the Correctional Service Canada (CSC) in the handling of Gordon's programming while in penitentiary addressing his multiple complex needs.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship.

There was no dispute on the facts that just over 22 months had passed between the scheduled preliminary hearing date of May 1998 and the scheduled trial date of February 2000. The Crown conceded that the delay had been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.  1) The length of delay was 8.5 months. 2) The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8. 3) The delay was sufficient to warrant a stay of the preliminary hearing. 4) The trial date was delayed by eight months. 5) The time period from the charge to the end of the trial was approximately 9 months.

The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property.

The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

It is not my place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. There is an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania. 2) On the basis of the committal order, the respondent's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and the fact that he has no real property and has identified no significant activities that connect him to the jurisdiction are fact. 3) While there is a risk of non-appearance in extradition proceedings, the Court finds that it would be non-sensical for the respondent to flee before the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania, neither are they great.

At this stage the pleadings and proposed pleadings must be taken at face value; there is no evidentiary requirement to establish they are correct. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third party proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence or that extra costs will be incurred by plaintiff in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff has not established any prejudice."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The Court accepted the defendant's evidence wherever it conflicts with that of the plaintiff and concluded the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 1) Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment unless the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination. Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. 2) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The plaintiff's griping was not exactly unusual in a work place and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his job function. 4) The Court awarded the plaintiff taxable costs."
2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The offence was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The officer who was on duty in a marked police car was struck by the vehicle as he was driving through a parking lot. The accused backed up to assist another officer on a 'non-priority' matter and the accused's vehicle moved forward and collided with another police vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether his actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a stopped vehicle constituted driving without Due Care and attention. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle which was positioned directly in front of the police car at this time. The Crown suggested that the officer thought the vehicle could slow down and that it did not accelerate and did not move quickly before striking the accused. The defence suggested the Crown had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the driver was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The Court found that neither seat belt, belonging to the officer and Mr. Rostotski, locked upon striking the officer. 2) The accused's evidence that neither was waving their arms or giving any other cause for concern other than Mr. Kuchar's statement to his wife saying 'That Vehicle Could Slow Down' was insufficient to conclude that the accused drove over the legal limit. 3) The Court reviewed four areas where there was inconsistency and conflict in the evidence given by the Crown and defence. The first issue was how far the officer's vehicle had rolled forward when he first met the accused and how long it had backed up before striking him. Given the nature of this confrontation and as an accident occurred, the officer could not have reasonably expected that a person would have been so close to him and he did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the victim. The actions of the officer which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, and secondly, his driving forward into the complainant. The Accused's driving was careless. On a balance of probabilities, given the situation the officer found himself in, he could not reasonably have reasonably anticipated that someone would have"
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. When the provisions of the policy provide coverage for that which is alleged in the pleadings, the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. At issue was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to the respondent's argument that it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by the defendant was 'off target'. 2)In any event, where a claim alleges facts which, if proven, would fall within the coverage of a policy the insurer has a duty to defend and after the trial, the judge concludes that the allegations do not come within the policy coverage the policy is under no obligation to protect. 3)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application to defend arises when he ultimately rules there is no obligation on the insurer but then determines that the obligation is an independent one. The chambers judge was required to embark on an extensive review. 4)The Court was in as good a position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c). The fact that the question is arguable should not be conclusive. 5)A more restricted inquiry on a policy coverage application would reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s.209(1) and s. 209(3). However, this Court was unable to determine the extent to which an insurer has an obligation by reason of an exclusionary provision in the policy. The Court was able to determine in light of the Nichols decision what the Chambers judge concluded was the correct conclusion. 6)Costs in the amount of $10,000 were awarded to the plaintiff."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. An authorization to intercept private communications was obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The complainant consented to the interception of the private communications and did in fact contact the accused and engage him in conversation that was surreptitiously intercepted by the police. The accused argued that the evidence of the conversation was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude there were reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. Even if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. The breach did not lead to automatic exclusion under s. 24(2). The accused's application to exclude the evidence was dismissed. 1)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there was sufficient evidence before the judge to consider whether the evidence ought to be excluded. 2)There was no Charter breach. 3)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization for intercept of private communications is non-conscriptive evidence. The Court considered the seriousness of the breach to be minimal and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The defence sought to use her prior statement, not only for the purposes of impeaching her credibility at trial but also as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial. HELD: 1)Annette Cook was not adverse but was now telling the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement; 2)the statement was improperly obtained in breach of theconfession rules of voluntariness; 3)the oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, which did not place her statement one step up from an unsworn statement.
