b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties share joint custody of the three children. Primary care is to be with the mother. The father is opposed to the payment of spousal support in any form. The mother seeks authorization to obtain passports for the children. HELD: 1) There is no evidence that the children's best interests are served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. 2) The mother is to have access on specific terms. She has been extensively involved in the operation of the property since marriage and is firmly settled into their local community. 3) The children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. Some will be appropriate Section expenses and some will not. 4) Although the mother's income had not been incurred at the time of the trial, there was no question that it was necessary and imminent."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service (RPS) from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed a notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There was no retroactive effect to the statute. 2)The current legislative mandate reflected in 2009 Act does not change the state of the law or Mr. Butler's rights from what it was before the new law came into force. The terms 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' were defined in the same manner. There was no obvious or identified unfairness attached to the legislative change in relation to the triggering events or definitions, nor to the ultimate consequence. 3)The starting point for the commencement of the limitation period is not the date of seizure as contended by the former officer but the date when the director became satisfied that the seized property constituted proceeds of unlawful activities. 4)The Director's application was not statute barred and there was no limitations issue."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The parents of one child, born April 9, 1992, were ordered to pay tax deductible child support of $600 per month as support for the child. The father applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which accumulated under Archambault J.’s order. HELD: 1) On all of the evidence, the father was underemployed and had not pursued employment opportunities since his termination with Ipsco. 2) The father was ordered to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return to school, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. It was very likely that the father had not behaved unreasonably or had acted in bad faith during family law proceeding. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the father has, indeed, been successful on this motion. 3) The mother was entitled to costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the court in order to force the father to disclose financial information."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act[1] for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a Rentalsman decision. HELD: 1) The tenants have until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve and file their notice of appeal and 15 days thereafter to file their appeal book and factum. The landlord has leave to apply on 48 hours notice to lift any stay of execution. 2) Based on the evidence provided, the Landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and that an Order should be made placing the landlord in possession of the rental premises. 3) The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. 4) There will be no order as to costs."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Canadian Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings.  1)The accused was charged that: on or about May 18, 2004 at Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan, she did: Count unlawfully produce Cannabis Marihuana contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and unlawfully possess Cannabis Cannabis in an amount not exceeding three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the CDSA. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. There were some delays attributable to the accused in time until she was ready to enter pleas, and later until she had the matter rescheduled for trial, delays which were deducted above. Otherwise, she appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charges set for trial. Limitations on institutional resources caused delays. 2)The weather caused delay from November 29, 2006 to January 19, 2007, period of 2 months. The total delay of twelve months occurred for the reasons indicated in Morin.  3)Evidence was led by the accused that she suffered actual prejudice because the outstanding charge has affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and has caused her stress and frustration. She further alleges that the passage of time makes it more difficult to properly defend against the charges. Actions of the accused were not sufficient to warrant an inquiry into the reasons for the delay."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The respondent applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)The parties agreed to impute income to the respondent in 1998. In 1999 he earned $43,209.40. In 2000 it was $44,386.34. There had been no material change in the circumstances of the children. 2)If the level of child support was simply an agreed upon amount, the question is whether there has been some other material change of circumstances which would make the income imputed to respondent inappropriate? 3)The respondent's income was reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating that he no longer attended institutional daycare. It was understood the children no longer required child care on Saturdays. The fact that someone may come into her home to provide child care services as opposed to using child care service is of no consequence."
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July 1999. The defendant admits that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion. The Defendant denies any liability under s.27 of the Stray Animals Act. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted in favour of the plaintiff and with pre-judgment interest from January 5, 2000 and costs. 1)The law in Saskatchewan is clear that cattle owner is liable for such loss as is caused by the entry of his cattle onto the crop of another. The present s. 27 (1) has been in the Act since 1977, when the Act was substantially re-written, apparently in response to the increasing urbanization of the province. Under both the present and pre-1977 statutes, the legal situation was the same -- the cattle owner was strictly liable for damage caused by his cattle. The Carrot River did not prove to be an impediment on this occasion. There was no evidence credibly suggesting that water levels would have hindered the cattle on earlier occasions, any more that it hindered them on the day they were seen by Mr. Korpach in the canola. 2)The plaintiff was entitled to give opinion evidence with respect to crop damage and assessment of crop damage. 3)No evidence was put before the court as to whether other cattle were also in the Canola field during the period in which the damage was caused. 4)Judgment interest was awarded to the plaintiff. 5)The court found that the plaintiffs had established that the defendants’ cattle caused the entire crop loss which the plaintiffs sustained. It was mere supposition that other neighbours had cattle. Given the knowledge that neighbours had of each other in rural Saskatchewan, it would be expected that the Defendant would have placed before the Court some evidence supportive of his supposition."
b_1995canlii5775.txt,"An application was brought under ss.58 and 59 of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act seeking approval for a proposal made by Gustafson Pontiac Buick. The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors. HELD: 1)The proposal was primarily calculated to benefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors of the corporation and not the general body of creditors. The proposal was effectively nothing more than a 'holding proposal'. The proposal did not comply with the requirements of the bankruptcy and was not properly approved by the creditors in accordance with s. 60(2)(d) and s. 54(2(d). The proposal failed to treat all of the unsecured creditors equally. 2)The trustee described GM and GMAC as 'franchise creditors' in his report to the creditors. This is an unfortunate description as the Act contemplates only three categories of creditors preferred, secured and un secured. Nevertheless, am not prepared to withhold approval to the proposal on this basis. 3)The court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors but also the conduct and conduct of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and requirements of commercial morality."
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. HELD: 1) The petitioner is entitled to half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage. The only evidence in writing of the parties' intentions is the respective wills executed shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to their respective children. There is, however, no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement they made at the time of the marriage.  2) There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent value of a family home from being divided equally between the parties. The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. 3) The respondent's assets were greater in value than the petitioner's."
c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J., which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. The issue was whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S. s. 1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs in the usual way. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of the words of s.5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power: the existence of an application or complaint, and the existence in a Labour Relations board to make final order in respect of the application. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' in the Act, nor is there anything in s. 25 or the other sections of the Act dealing with resolution of disputes by arbitration to indicate an intention to grant supervisory or other powers to the Board in the arbitration process."
e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention is that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town disputes that such instructions were given and that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town of Martensville."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the property in 1998. The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She sought recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, provided the plaintiff with a copy of the building permit that she had obtained from the rural municipality. She also provided copies of the city's building permit, which the plaintiff had obtained through a confidential agreement. The certificate was not signed pending that information.

7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties made counter applications to vary spousal and child support and lump sum support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than 1 year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The parties originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. MacDonald's improved employment and income situation. HELD: 1) The parties have not addressed the question of costs directly pending their decision. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing in RRSP's and other expenses such as furniture, etc., a lump sum award of $8,000 is warranted. This amount shall be payable on or before October 30, 2001.  2) The Court reviewed the farming income over the years and also the family's and Mr. Vermeulen's (who had been awarded significant farm aid in 1999) and found that their income had improved since the trial in 1998, primarily because better up to date financial information was available and because of the defendant's receipt of substantial farm aid. The defendant had not seriously looked for accommodations to purchase, she did not have information on how much she would require to make purchase viable, there was no evidence that she could obtain the necessary mortgage money to complete purchase, nor was there any information on what it would cost her to move. 3) In the present circumstances, the Court found there was a current need for an award to compensate the respondent for her relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above.  4) The respondent's income for support purposes is $41,000. The respondent shall pay child support of $567.00 per month with the defendant to pay $12,000 per month in accordance with Federal Child Support Guidelines. 5) There is no magic formula to arrive at a figure of imputed income to account for this aspect of operating farming business. Does this mean that she had to make the application before moving and cannot make it after the move? think not. To rule otherwise would be to place an undue and arbitrary restriction on the Court's decision."

The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction.

Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the Queen v.

The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","The petitioner did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy made the division of the balance of the property problematic at best. HELD: 1)Division of matrimonial property. The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300.00 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of my original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. 2)The petitioner's wife was entitled to her share of the net proceeds to her husband which covered the maintenance payments ordered for November, December, January and February in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. 3)The respondent's claim for set-off should be allowed. There was no doubt the petitioner used assets to pay his legal fees and the trustee should be granted the same privilege. 4)The husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required income to live on and the barley fell into that category. In any event, the petitioner paid one half of his net proceeds of the sale to his wife and 44% to his former wife. He argued that for the foreseeable future he will be unable to make any maintenance payments to them."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings.

It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action.

HELD: 1)A conditional order of discharge requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750.00 from any source to the trustee was ordered. 2)The bankrupt was in his early fifties and in good health.

The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The salary was calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid him any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and that he ought to have had a comparable employment. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge found that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had met his duty to mitigate. 2)The appellant's severance terms of his contract with STC were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. Indeed they were inserted on the premises he had been in the service of the Crown since February 1, 1982, the day he joined Sask. Housing and was the sole shareholder of the company. He did not agree with the appellant's argument that the Crown Employment Contracts Act had set aside the contractual provisions for payment on dismissal contained in all Crown contracts, including those of Crown corporations, and directed instead that payment be determined in accordance with common law principle. With that in mind, the appellant at the time of his dismissal was a career civil servant, skilled and dedicated."

The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received.

3_1998canlii14061.txt,"FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for its costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc., while a corporation in Saskatchewan, wasincorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not succeed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly has little or none assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff shall have one set of costs of the application in any event of breach of the court's jurisdiction. 1)There are appropriate circumstances to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security at this stage against either or both of the plaintiffs. In the present case, given the amount of the claim against the plaintiff in the amount and the significant claim for costs which could be awarded to it in the event of successful defence, in excess of $55,000 with little assets in either province held by either plaintiff. The fact that it was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 2)There were appropriate circumstances in Thole v. McKenna (1988), 36 Sask. R. 159 (Q.B.). In the exercise of my discretionary discretionary, the Court would dismiss SaskPower's motion. 3)The court has the power to direct security for costs in the present circumstances and, if so, whether it should do so. 4)There is a significant factor that precludes the Court from making that kind of an order. It is not necessarily fatal to the applicant's motion if it is determined the plaintiffs' claims are joint. Only that it is consideration seriously to be looked at."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Proceedings Act for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel, Merchant Law Group, (MLG), examine on her affidavit the names and addresses of the plaintiffs who had travelled with the defendant during the purposed class. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The wording of the Act does not confers jurisdiction on the court to make orders prior to the certification of the proceedings as a class action. The usual practices and application of the common law regarding civil litigation apply. The practices and implementation of the Rules of Court do not get suspended merely because this matter has been brought under The Class Actions Act. However, other decisions of this court have relied on s. 14 or 24 of the Class Action Act. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law. 2) There is no reference by the Court of Queen's Bench or SCC to s14 or 23 of the class action act. The Court's inherent jurisdiction is to be exercised judicially and only when the relief sought cannot reasonable and realistically be obtained by the applications in some other lawful manner. What would be the purpose of subsection 43(1) if not to include a suspension of the limitation period for actions that are not certified as class action?"
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","Division of matrimonial property and spousal maintenance. The parties separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the parties had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining the respondent on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally from the bench. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J. established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in probationary position. This was after the 1 year order had expired and only a few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that her “disabled and still receiving treatments”, that she had sought permanent full time employment since losing the Westfair position, but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate she was unable to work and did not, in fact, say that she could not work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking full time position. 2) The respondent's 2007 income was $38,964.37, which was an error as it failed to take into account employment expenses of $8,822 allowed by Canada Revenue Agency and expressly found by the chambers judge to be reasonable. The proper income for the appellant was still in the neighbourhood of $30,000. He also still had the same medical issues and the couples' daughter was living with him and going to university full time. Given the circumstances it would be unfair to order retroactive maintenance."

The applicant had not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that Mr. Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the charter Motions.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed and quashed the warrant. This rendered the search unlawful and thereby a presumptive breach of the respondent's Charter rights. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The Crown argued that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the decision. The court concluded that the warrant was valid, the search was valid and there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the fruits of the operation. The evidence obtained as a result was wrongly excluded and the result of the trial would not necessarily have been the same."

The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006.

The decision of the Hearing officer is set aside. The matter is remitted to the Hearing Officer for a review. 1) The tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. 2) The Court must bear this factor in mind when reviewing the legality of decisions and conclusions reached by the Rentalsman.  3) The court finds the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter must be remitted. 4) The simple fact tenant's application is not formally before hearing officer at the same time as landlord's application does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord's dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.",The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the motor vehicle accident. The defendant argued there was an 'air of realty' to the plaintiff's argument that she had been stopped for 45 seconds and then the burden shifted to the defendant to satisfy the court that he had a bonafide defence or at least an arguable issue to be tried. HELD: Judgment was entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed. The plaintiff's damage claim is further complicated in this particular matter as a result of the application for interim payment under Rule 33.01 (A)(1). It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The court is satisfied any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial.

A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged as follows: that between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on the complainant.

e_2000skqb515.txt,"The Crown applied for an order forfeiting a vehicle pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. Both individuals were charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. HELD: The Crown's application was viewed as an application by Brooks for relief from forfeiture. The Crown did not dispute the assertion by the Crown that the Lincoln was within the definition of 'offence-related property'. The test for determining whether sentence is disproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding. A lesser test would tend to trivialise the Charter.

Where the Minister received a request in the proper form and where it was determined leases were necessary, the leasing costs would be the respondent's responsibility.","The applicant school board sought a declaration that the Province was responsible to provide school buildings required for the delivery of a basic Public School Program to the students of Nova Scotia and that, where it is necessary, the Province bears the responsibility for the negotiations and payment of rental costs associated with the leases. The issue was whether the Minister of Education (Minister) was required to reimburse the Cape Breton Board for the costs incurred by the Board in leasing the school buildings from the Church. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Province was not required to pay the leasing expenses. 2)The lease costs were to the same extent as would be the cost of supplying the building free of costs. 3)The payment of leasing expenses by the Province is not unprecedented. From 1978 to 1982, the North Side-Victoria Amalgamated School Board leased parish schools with the leasing costs being fully paid by the province. Absent the report, under s.50(1) and s.15(1), there is no obligation on the Province to fund the costs of acquiring, constructing or leasing a school building without the Minister's approval or involvement."
d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father, Gilbert Hill, to pay child support for his son, who was now 19 years old. The father argued that he had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000. The court was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it. He did not err. 1)The father clearly understood that the child was not intending to work permanently, but was taking a hiatus before continuing his education. There was no serious suggestion from the father that he was able to provide for himself or remove himself from parental charge. 2)There was no evidence that the father intended to continue his education at a post-secondary institution. It was not his intention to seek employment or pursue a career in the field of education. He was only living with his mother when the accident occurred. He had graduated from high school in 2001 and was working at two part time jobs and saving little bit of money for his education as well as contributing to his mother's household expenses. Upon graduation he made inquires about the requirements for entry into Saint Mary's and Mount Saint Vincent Universities. He learned that he needed to better his marks for acceptance. That is why he returned to high school. Although he abandoned that upgrading attempt in the months leading up to the accident, he had interviewed for and was accepted into an e-commerce program at CompuCollege commencing in September 2001. During that time he was working and saving a little bit to improve his marks. He returned to school in April 2001. He remained dependent for the duration of the program commencing June 2005. 3)The evidence supports the judge's finding that, at the age of 19 years, the child remained dependent by virtue of his educational plans without evidence of his continuing dependency. The Court concluded that the order for support was not premised on the child's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of postsecondary studies. It is not an appropriate case for a time-limited order."
6_1990canlii4137.txt,"This was an application under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the two appellant university professors was invalid and denied the rights of the appellants as guaranteed under ss. 15(1) and (7) of the Charter, and an order for reinstatement and back pay. Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for:(a) an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and unconsonsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that they could commence work at the beginning of the September 1990 university term.  (b) an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms fostered by human rights legislation would result. (c) the respondent is creature of statute, not designated as an agency of the Crown. Pursuant to the statute, Technical University of N. S., R.S.N.S., Ch. 463, Ch. 214 as amended, and the jurisdiction concerned does not have an overriding clause in its Human Rights Act, as do Alberta, Quebec and Saskatchewan. This would be so for the following reasons: 1) by s. 32 of the Collective Agreement, the respondent and the Faculty Association agreed that the applicant would be employed from April 1988 to December 1988 as an Adjunct Professor in the respondent's faculty at substantially lower salary than he had been receiving, though presume he was also receiving his pension. 2) every jurisdiction in Canada has an anti-discrimination statute. It is unlikely that a complainant would resort to constitutional action in the courts, rather than the complaint process under the anti‑discrimination laws."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiffs sought to disburse $78,400.00 from two mortgage brokers for the purposes of disbursement of mortgage advances. The second mortgagee to the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early 1987, the first mortgagee received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draws or advances in particular manner. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff disbursed funds contrary to the letter of direction dated March 9, 1987. The plaintiffs have also alleged negligent misrepresentation and in the alternative, breach of trust on the part of the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff's conduct throughout his retainer as solicitor for the project was one of conscientiousness, always attempting to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients. 2)There were certain statements or allegations contained in the pleadings and made during the proceedings which could be construed as raising an accusation of deliberate wrongdoing. It is these two omissions that form the bases for the plaintiff's negligent misrepresentations."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","The accused was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin. He pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused had a lengthy criminal record, had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences, and was subject to a firearms prohibition at the time of the offence. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. 2) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was not prepared to impose an order pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code primarily as a result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factors in the case that had to be addressed. The Crown suggested that the Court should allow the CSC to do their work without being impeded by the Court's arbitrary imposition of such an order that would result in the accused not being eligible for parole until he had served half of his sentence."
7_1996canlii7107.txt,"The respondent applied to reduce on-going maintenance from $600 per month for his two children and to reduce the accumulated arrears of approximately $14,600. The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance of $600 per month for his 2 daughters and to reduce arrears of approximately $14,600. HELD: The father was to pay child support of $300 per month per child during months when his gross monthly income was less than $2,200 and he was hired on jobs in accordance with union hiring practices. He had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance benefits. He proposed that his support obligation be eliminated or at least reduced during his months of unemployment. Counsel did suggest that the obligation be reduced by one-half. Given the significant reduction in income experienced by the respondent since 1994, there has been amaterial change in circumstances.

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

The plaintiff also seeks aggravated damages in the amount of $5,000.00.  1) The plaintiff's affidavit describes the circumstances of the assault, the defendant's choice of not filing any affidavit, and the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.  2) The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) reviewed the purposes of that Rule and concluded that a fair award was $12,500."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. Her position is that she and the father should have joint custody of the children but her home be the children's primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. HELD: 1) The grandmother is a person of sufficient interest with respect to the children. It is only if grant the grandmother the appropriate status that she can apply for custody. Her access is to be 'no more than one hour per week'. If accept the grandmother's evidence, the father will have access for the rest of his life. If not, the court could serve an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. The father represented himself at trial.  2) It is not disputed that the mother and father commenced a cohabitating relationship in January 2005 when the mother was 18 and she was living with the father. She has lived in the home for 18 years. She is the biological mother of the three children. She was the biological grandmother. 3) The father takes the position that it would be in the best interests of the child to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. He is not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access with the children, but her access is sporadic prior to the mother's move. She will receive the approximate sum of $2,000 per month for the remainder of her life."
b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant sought solicitor and client costs on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs of The Queen's Bench Rules. It was clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence now showed that substantial offers were made through counsel although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. HELD: The application was taken out. 1)The court had an inherent power to vary its own order so as to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of the judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment and the solicitor's costs claimed by the applicant. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of the estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded. 2)The Court was faced with two equally untenable positions in determining the costs. If the costs of the litigation were to be paid out of the award, the remainder may be insufficient to meet the applicant's anticipated needs. This is not an appropriate case in which to order full solicitor/client costs. The judgment in March 1999 created debt owing to the applicant from the respondent and the debt became due and payable on the date of the offer, being March 19, 1999. The Executions Act states that interest runs “from the time of entering judgment” and not from the time before entering formal judgment. The evidence now shows, in fact, that substantial offer were made directly by counsel for the parties and that many interlocutory applications and steps would have been unnecessary had the applicant agreed to submit the question of determination of reasonable maintenance to the Court for summary disposition. This argument cannot be accepted. 3)The applicant's offer of settlement did not meet the requirements of the Queen’s Bench Rules and the re-hearing of this issue did not involve the merits of the case and was limited to the issue of costs."
7_1995canlii4030.txt,"After a series of pre-trial conferences, and the exchange of some correspondence between the parties lawyers, the husband took the position that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of his pension. The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations which took place during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)There was nothing in the evidence to indicate the parties intended that each individual item agreed to during the course of negotiations toward final agreement would constitute separate, independent, binding and enforceable agreements irrespective of whether agreement was reached on all of the other items outstanding between the parties. Accordingly, there was no contract that the judge could enforce. 2)The evidence did not indicate an intention by the parties to settle on a piecemeal or instalment basis. What the judge failed to note was that the courts were dealing with complete agreements settling or purporting to settle all aspects of the actions in question."

c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)It is difficult to think that the legislature intended that the effect should be fatal when the notice does not arrive within the prescribed time and arrives within sufficient time to allow for the hearing and determination of the appeal in keeping with the scheme of the enactment. 2)At best, this amounts to substantial compliance of near perfect sort, as was the case here, where notice was mailed on the day before the period expired, was being delivered on day of expiry, and was delivered the day after. As might have been expected, nothing turned on the fact the notice did not arrive a day or two earlier, for the administrator and board were still able to act upon it in accordance with the requirements. This was especially so in the circumstances, where the assessment had not only been completed well in advance of May 31, but had been published several days beforehand, leaving ample time for the performance of these duties. Nor did any other form of prejudice arise. 3)Wascana Energy exercised its right to appeal properly or effectively, requiring the Board of Revision to entertain the appeal. 4)Although the legislature did not expressly provide for the effect of imperfect compliance or noncompliance with the provisions of subsection 303(1) from the perspective of the exercise of the right conferred by the subsection, ascribing this meaning to the word give is troublesome. Indeed, the proper exercise of appeal, when notice is given by means of registered mail, should be made to depend not upon the posting of the notice within the 20 day period but upon the receipt of it by the administrator within the period. 5)This is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given by registered mail. It is suggestive, generally, of an appeal process intended to operate along ordinary lines, consistent with everyday practice and expectation. The essential significance of the subsection is that it empowers persons to give notice to, as distinct from requiring them to serve notice upon, the administrator. This is less formal expression suggesting a less exacting term. 6)The Court held that the appeal could not be entertained."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused.

The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. 1)There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the responsibility of the presiding judge to ensure fair hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced.

Even if she had read the record she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence in admissible, she was correct to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recuse herself. 2)Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal."

He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","HELD: The Court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s. 198(3)(a) of the Act. The Court held that the termination of benefits was appropriate because the respondent had failed to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to the applicant prior to October 1 and that the Court was not prepared to find that the applicant caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's holiday pay was based on his wage, plus one-half of his truck expense allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff's wage. The defendant argued that the allowance was really a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. 2)The defendant asserted that even if the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. The court held that this section would prevent an employee from waiving her entitlement. Section 75 appears to be a full answer to the defendant's position in this regard. The onus is on the defendant to rebutting the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in the LSA. 3)The court reviewed the Limitation of Actions Act and found that the defendant had jurisdiction to entertain civil action for non-payment of holiday pay."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The applicants apply for a declaration that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter. HELD: 1)The Court must balance the value of freedom of expression against reputation. The gravity of the libel must be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. 2)The accused are not faced with a reverse onus under s. 11(c) or s. 612 of the Code since they are relying on the truth of the alleged defamatory material. The Court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge. 3)Section 298, 299 and 300 constitute a limit prescribed by law within s. of the Criminal Code."

Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly.

Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,The respondent issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery.

d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","HELD: The hearing judge correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find his net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. Counsel for Montgrand appealed SGI's calculation of the IRB on monies owed to him on the basis of pre-judgment interest. Counsel now concedes that SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states, 'Interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the Act is to be calculated in accordance with the Prejudgment Interest Act.' The phrase'subject to' may mean'subservient to' or'subordinate to' but that is too restrictive a definition of the phrase. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner’s IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. If it is greater, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 117(4)."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. The appellants wish to add as ground of appeal that the respondent, the plaintiff in the main action, is not a 'lawful plaintiff' and, therefore, not entitled to security for the costs application. This point was raised before the chambers judge in the Supreme Court and is referred to in his reasons. The amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not result in any wasted effort to address the appeal as originally framed. Any prejudice to the respondent or intervenor which may result if the amended ground is found to be without merit is not attributable to the ground advanced by way of amendment as opposed to having been included in the original notice. There is no suggestion of any prejudice in that sense resulting from the amendment."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.",The accused was committed to stand trial on one of the fraud charges. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. 1)The length of delay was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. The prejudice to the accused was substantial. 2)The Court was not satisfied that the inherent time requirements of the case required a 22-month delay from charge to trial. 3)There was no evidence that the accused had been prejudiced by the delay. 4)The time period to be considered was the period from the charge to the end of the trial.
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.",The applicant sought judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The applicant was a Roma and Romanian national who resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. He was later apprehended and he admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee affords an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania.  2)The risk of non-appearance is further heightened by the applicant's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence and has not satisfied the compensation judgment awarded against him.  3)His application for interim judicial release did not engage those legal obligations.  4)It was not appropriate for the Minister to make such an inquiry as these are matters clearly and properly left to him.

The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The applicant sought leave to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it could claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant was found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application was granted. To attain uniformity, it seems reasonable on an application for leave under s.7, to encourage the joinder of third parties thereby averting duplication in law suits, and to minimize delay and prejudice to the applicant by appropriate directions rather than refusal of leave. At this stage the pleadings and proposed pleadings must be taken at face value; there is no evidentiary requirement to establish they are correct. The applicant's claim dates back to 1984; it can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third parties proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by plaintiff in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's claim."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to for the notice period based on his income and value of benefits for the previous 12 months, less the six weeks' pay he received, and less the wages and the value of the benefits he has received in his new employment during the time of the notice. 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for a summary judgment. 2) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial. 3) The plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing. 4) In this case the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff would have justified him being warned to not continue such conduct, but it falls far short of conduct justifying cause for termination. 5) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one. 6) The court accepted the defendant's evidence that the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. The defendant had not accessed the internet since he was arrested. He stated he did not own a computer, he had never owned a computer and did not intend to again access the internet.

The defendants apply for an order setting a date for the hearing of the plaintiffs' application for an Order certifying this action as a class action pursuant to The Class Actions Act as am. HELD: Although the time lines established by the court had expired, there was an order granting leave to the plaintiffs to serve and file an application extending the times within which steps may be taken leading up to the hearing. The plaintiffs have not met that schedule in that they have failed to deliver their written arguments and authorities by June 30, 2010 as directed. If the plaintiffs fail to serve, file and file the application by August 27, 2010, the defendants may apply for appropriate remedy. 1)The time lines were set aside by the Court in order to allow leave to serve. The time lines had expired and the plaintiffs had not indicated that they wished to extend them. 2)The defendants have not provided any explanation for their failure to meet the prescribed time lines other than to say that 'we are talking to people'.

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a wholeÃ¹she has 53 prior convictionsÃ¹and to have adequate regard for the objectives of section 487.051 as identified in R. v. Briggs 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON C.A.), (2001), 45 C.R. (5th) 99 (Ont. C.A.). In light of the nature of the respondent's current offence, her lengthy record, her history of recidivism, and the relatively modest impact an order would have on her privacy and security interests, we are satisfied an order should have been made. Accordingly, and in the best interests of the administration of justice, there will be an order under section 487.051(3) in Form 5.04 for the taking of bodily samples from the respondent. If any directions should be required in relation to the execution of the order, the parties are given leave to informally apply for such directions through the Registrar's office.","Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under s. 487.051(3) under the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence. With respect, we are of the opinion the judge erred in declining to make the order. The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives.

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a cross-walk constituted driving without care and care. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past Super Store, and secondly, his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar.  2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that, given the situation the accused found himself in, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him, and further that the police officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the accused.

Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.",The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along Highway #3 in the community of Woods Harbour. At the time his driver's license was revoked. The only issue at trial was whether this makes the accused guilty of the offence of driving a motor vehicle on the highway while his licence was revoked contrary to s.287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The words'motor vehicle' and'required to be registered' were used within the sections of the motor vehicle act to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV's or other prohibited vehicles. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive an ATV on a highway because it was a prohibited vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get license.

HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","HELD: The court declined to issue summonses as requested. The issues raised by these claims were important issues to the potential Plaintiffs, and may well be worth litigating, but that litigation, in my view, must be done in the Court of Queen’s Bench, by either issuing a new claim, or by way of enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made."

The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The respondent, Royal, agreed it had a duty to defend but submitted that Royal also had a responsibility to defend in the name and on behalf of the insured. The chambers judge found that Royal was not obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The two issues to be resolved on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.",HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was dismissed. The trial judge correctly identified the law in s. 686 of the Criminal Code and applied the de minimis non curat lex principle. The appellant was entitled to considerable deference with respect to how she treated the complainant. The court found that the trial judge properly instructed herself on the law and that her findings of fact were supported by the evidence.

The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: Date 20-Oct-2004 Contract between the parties to cover feeding and maintenance of about one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff took delivery of the cows and cared for them as he had agreed to do in the October 2004 contract. He looked after the cows as well as the calves as they were born. He sent monthly invoices to the plaintiff who paid them as they received. At the end of each month, the plaintiff submitted an invoice to Ray for any costs associated with the above conditions. The terms of the invoice past due after 15 days is subject to 1% per month interest. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $850.00. 1)In law an agreement to come to an agreement was an essential condition to the parties' business. 2)An agreement to pay a bonus was never reached where the plaintiff was not able to work around-the-clock as required. He did not feel that bonus was appropriate given the work that he himself had to do. In the year 2005-2006 he did not contemplate payment of a bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May. No bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-06 year. The parties conducted their business together according to the terms of their October 2004 agreement with the exception that the cost of labour was raised to sixty cents per day per cow. Another sixty calves were delivered to Dobson's pastures in the spring and early summer of 2006. Benson testified that he never sent bill to him because he didn't know what to charge. He testified in cross-examination that he had heard some people were charging seventy dollars per calf but he felt he couldn't charge that much. He agreed that a bonus should be paid for each live calf brought to his pastures. He also testified that the bonus was left blank in the contract because neither of them were sure what it should be. He said that he and Dobson never seemed to get chance to sit down and discuss the bonus. He claimed that he was owed $7,800.00 in the 2005 and 2006 years. He alleged that the plaintiff did not have copy of the final invoice given to him and did not bring copy of that bill with him to Court."

The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act.

It was for the purpose of entry of the respondent's name in the Child Abuse Register.

On a balance of probabilities the Court found the evidence that the complainant had sexually assaulted the respondent, that her mother's boyfriend had told her what had taken place and that she had grabbed his crotch.

e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","HELD: The Court found that the plaintiffs’ claim was an abuse of process because the plaintiffs never applied for judicial review to set aside the appeal decision rendered by the elected directors of the CÉF, and the plaintiff’s complaint under the Code remained pending before the SHRC. The court found that s. 23 of the Charter gives it an exclusive and unfettered authority to decide whether it will admit any non-gendered children to attend a fransaskois school in Saskatchewan, and neither this Court nor the SRC may inquire into its reasons or interfere with the exercise of its discretion."

In the meantime, the Municipality's road construction specifications had become more stringent and his proposal did not comply with the new specifications. The development officer found the application to be incomplete and the applicant applied for certiorari and mandamus. Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy","Land developer after applying for, failing to receive final subdivision approval, looks to the Court for relief including an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the development officer's decision that the application was incomplete, declaration that it is in fact complete, and an order of mandamus directing the Development Officer to issue the final approval. HELD: 1)The applicant land developer applied for, failed to receive, tentative subdivision approval in October 1997 and received the same on March 16, 1998. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The applicant submitted its last plan for final approval on March 14, 2000. The next day, the applicant's application was determined to be incomplete for essentially two reasons. One of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the new road standards were applicable to this Application. The Applicant was entitled to a declaration that the Application for final subdivision was complete, (again subject to a non-contentious error in the plan). 2)The application for a final subdivision plan approval was received within two years of the date of the approval of the tentative plan. The third requirement appears to be inconsequential. The very subject matter of this hearing was the very subject of the hearing. 3)All aspects of s. 283 have been met and the applicant would have been entitled to final approval under s.283. The mere existence of another potential remedy is not enough to deny mandamus. The Municipal Government act provides that an aggrieved person can appeal a refusal to grant subdivision permit. The application for preliminary subdivision approval is a complete application subject to two requirements: (1) the failure to comply with the new roads standards and (2) the completion of one of the courses on one of a lots in the Plan. 4)The Municipality relies upon subsections 278(1), (2)(f) and (g) which provide that an application for subdivision approval shall be approved if the proposed subdivision is in accordance with the enactments in effect at the time complete application is received by the Development officer. The Court will not allow an appeal unless it determines that the decision of council or city council, as the case may be, does not reasonably carry out the intent of the municipal planning strategy or conflicts with the provisions of the land-use by-laws or the subdivision bylaw. 5)It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal.

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice. It is immaterial at this stage that the City may have an absolute defence.","FIAT: This is an application by Saskatchewan Government Insurance on behalf of the defendant for an order pursuant to Rule 107A(c) of the Queen's Bench Rules and s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act granting leave to the defendant, William J. Schmidt, to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party to this action. HELD: The application is granted as requested. 1)The law respecting an application to add third parties in Saskatchewan is set out in Koskie v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co., [2011] S.J. No. 821 (QL), wherein Currie J. states at para. 2. There is yet another ground on which the City is absolved from liability. The Supreme Court of Canada in Lewis recognized that it was entirely permissible for local authority to limit its liability. Section 154(1.1) of The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 states that s. 308 of The Cities Act, S.S. 2002, c. C-11.1, which reads: 308 city is not liable for damage caused by the presence, absence or insufficiency of any wall, fence, guardrail, curb, pavement markings, traffic control device or barrier; or by any construction, obstruction or erection of any earth, rock, tree or other material or thing adjacent to or in, along or on street that is not on the travelled portion of the street. The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage to construction site under the Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge in Saskatoon, caused as result of his truck leaving the surface of the road at the head of the bridge going over the guardrail and falling into the excavation pit.  2)To refuse the application under s. of the contributory negligence act, would likely result in the requirement for a second litigation process to be commenced, that being by the defendants against the proposed third party claiming contributory negligence. This would to large extent create a legal process almost wholly duplicating that of the litigation to this stage. Courts have been vigilant to attempt to prevent such duplicate processes where the issue of prejudice could be addressed through direction and order from the Court on the combined process as an alternative."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice.

The defendant had no criminal record prior to these offences. He had cooperated extensively with police and made a conscious decision not to do so. 3)The defendants' father had acted as a strict jailer for a couple of months while the defendant was held in remand.

Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is not relevant. Alternatively, the accused sought exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code was not conscriptive evidence because the respondent essentially acted as police agent in the course of the conversation. 2)The respondent had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had committed offences. The respondent was prepared to initiate telephone call to the accused and engage him in conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could confirm the accused's allegations. The evidence was non-conscriptive and ought not to be excluded. 3)There was no Charter breach and the evidence was admissible."

The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.",HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the petitioner. The Court held that the petitioner had standing to bring this application on the basis that she had not established that she was entitled to access to the respondent.
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 a.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault. 1)The accused's actions against the victim were done in self-defence as contemplated by s.34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that the existence of an actual assault is not a prerequisite for defence under s. 34(2). 2)The evidence established that the accused caused death or grievous bodily harm to the victim. It is not legally necessary to establish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of other joint participants for the purpose of determining which acts caused which injuries. The terms 'aid' and 'abet' have similar meanings. 3)In all of the circumstances, the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that bodily harm was objectively foreseeable by Knife as a probable consequence to the plot to which he was party. After all, he admitted that his purpose was to inflict 'hurt' on his victim."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation sought directions pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 to ensure that this underlying issue, that was whether Nova Scotia or Ontario was the appropriate forum, was addressed. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). 1)The plaintiff's mistake was not one of substance rendering its claim for relief nullity but rather a deliberate decision not to file a defence. 2)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the court that in order to do justice between these parties, should exercise my discretion in favour of the defendant. 3)The defendant's apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, while simultaneously drawing the plaintiff into litigation in Ontario where it has no presence, is in my view incapable of constituting a reasonable excuse, as contemplated by this court's interpretation of Civil Procedure Rules."

HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","Hrynewich Holdings Ltd. granted a mortgage to the respondent in 2011. At that time, the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72. The respondent sought an order for solicitor-client costs to be set aside. In its place, the parties agreed there should be an order that either party may return the matter of costs relating to the motion for the deficiency judgment to the Chambers judge. The appeal will also be allowed to this extent. The appellants have been successful on this appeal. While the Court appreciates the concessions made by the respondent, it does not believe that s. 25 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act should be interpreted liberally thereby permitting the sale proceeds ($372,444.01) to be applied to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions of the debt. The proceeds of the sale must be distributed pro rata between purchase and non purchase money balances. When that balance is exhausted, the respondent is entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the respondent. The court reviewed the decision in Andrew (CA) and found that the appellant was entitled to apply the proceeds of sale against the balance owing on both purchase money (which was a purchase money portion) of the loan and then sue for the balance. The appellant appealed the decision and sought determination as to the extent to which s.25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The appellant respects the spirit and intent of the LCRA and is the correct interpretation to be placed on that provision. In addition, the appellant accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment.  2)The appeal is allowed with respect to the balance of the deficiency. The decision of the respondent was in accord with the direction from the Court when it remitted the matter to Queen’s Bench.  3)The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the Act and held that the amount owed should be $162,675. This amount was determined by deducting from the total debt the portion of which was not purchase money. The remaining LCRA protection was $16,000."

The judgment was set aside after the expiry of 90 days from the date of judgment. The applicant has filed an affidavit in support of having the summons issue from Scott Lachappelle, director of the director of R-Rock.

c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The officer testified that he was on patrol in the Paddockwood District when the 'ride along' occurred. The accused's vehicle swerved to the right-hand side of the highway more than necessary as the officer approached it. He stopped the second test as the accused was blowing outside the mouthpiece again. He turned on the instrument and waited for the ready light to come on. He explained to the accused that he needed a steady breath and that his lips had to be sealed. The second test was successful and the accused took deep breath and blew three times in all. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing to provide an adequate sample. 1)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by ss.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance. 2)The accused's testimony was accepted over that of the officer. 3)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details.

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan.

The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  2)The applicant had a close relationship with both parents. He did not deny that he and his daughter discussed the possibility of moving to Kelowna.

There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001.

They had two children, born in 1980 and 1995. The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement in 1996 and separated in 1995. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders since the separation. In 1998, the parties entered a partial agreement for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care.

In 2002, she began to file direct claims against the petitioner, alleging that she was owed $1,100 per month for medical and other benefits separate from the post-tax deductions for long term disabilities. The petitioner appealed. Appeal dismissed. The court found that the parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that had never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children."

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","This was an appeal from a conviction for break, enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. The ground is that Leo Dion, the designated officer of the corporation pursuant to an agreement between the parties, failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The defendants' solicitor appeared at the scheduled examinations but neither Leo nor Louis Dion appeared, nor did anyone else appear on behalf of either corporate defendant nor did the defendants' counsel appear. HELD: 1)This discretionary relief was not granted to enable the defendants to stall the action or to frustrate the plaintiff's claim. But as solicitor, he has duty to more than just his clients. He has a duty of courtesy and professionalism to his fellow solicitors. Regrettably, in the same fashion as before the contempt proceedings were adjourned, they have continued to duck and weave, and have effectively stalled all reasonable attempts on the part of the plaintiff to proceed with the lawsuit. The complaints of the defendants about the unilateral scheduling by the plaintiff’s solicitor is without merit. The date was unilaterally set as a last resort because of the complete lack of courtesy, professionalism and courtesy that is to be expected of a member of the legal profession. 2)The defendants were expected to promptly file their defences and proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it is eventually determined. The conduct money tendered respecting Leo Dion did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend'. It cannot be utilized respecting these particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence."

Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant and respondent union entered into a collective agreement in 1994.

The parties filed evidence that was considerably contradictory relating to each other and respective abilities as parent. viva voce hearing was held to assist determining the questions of credibility. The mother aged 31 years of age, is employed as secretary. The mother remained at home during the first year of the child's birth then returned to work. The mother suffered from post partum depression following the child's birth and as result attempted to commit suicide. She was hospitalized for three weeks to receive psychiatric assistance. The psychiatrist who treated the mother states the mother is unlikely to have future suicide attempts and has responded well to treatment.

The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses it incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it claimed were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses suffered by the plaintiff by the defendant's unjustified termination of the contract without prior notice. HELD: The contract was awarded to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was awarded the contract by the issuance of a purchase order incorporating the terms and conditions contained in the specifications rather than the figure set out in the purchase order. The contractual obligation to maintain the banks, ditches, railway tracks and roadways was to be construed by the wording in the contract, and any variation in wording between the original invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender is inconsequential."

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The Father was the primary care parent during his relationship with the Mother. The Mother was the secondary care parent. The Father was an abuser of marijuana and because of this abuse the child was at risk if in his care unsupervised. Both parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between the Father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. HELD: The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be better prepared to take on these tasks in the future. The evidence was inconclusive and as result the Mother had not proven these allegations on the necessary balance of probabilities.
e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT: The Crown applies to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. The Crown seeks to use her prior statement, not only for the purposes of impeaching her credibility at trial but also as substantive evidence that may be left with the jury at the end of the trial. HELD: 1)Annette Cook is not adverse but is now telling the truth after lying about certain matters in her statement. The statement was improperly obtained in breach of the Confession rules of voluntariness. 2)The statement does not meet the threshold of reliability set out in R. v. K.G.B., supra. 3)The fact that she was 19 years old, the mother of four children and was eight and one-half months pregnant with her fifth child is a factor to be taken into account in assessing the reliability of her statement as it relates to third parties. If all or most of the statement was demonstrably false, the trier of fact is free to accept all, some or none of the testimony offered."
