2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the parties. Since the parties ceased to cohabit, the child has resided with the petitioner and the respondent. The respondent has had access. The petitioner herself admits that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the parties would'switch the child back and forth every second day.' Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. HELD: 1)Interim custody is granted on an interim basis. The child has and does reside with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the petitioner. There is plenty of affidavit evidence that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. The court must take into account the current status quo, namely that the child is doing well and has a loving, stable relationship with her mother, the petitioner has provided suitable care and has met Keanna's needs. Notwithstanding the frequent disputes between the parties, the court finds that the respondent made no attempts to gain custody until he was served with the application. 2)The court takes into consideration the current situation in which the child resides with the mother and the petitioner, with access, visitation arrangements and costs.","At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support.

2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day and half day on October 18 and October 20, 2011. The Sheas, by omitting some important information in making their claim, undermined the strength of their claim. This was not one of those rare cases where solicitor client costs should be awarded. Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their expenses of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete indemnification of their costs of litigation, as in many other cases, the dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation. Tariff “C” is the appropriate guideline. The Bowsers requested declaration that there were entitled to right-of-way across the land of the Bowsers and were seeking mandatory injunction and permanent injunction as well as damages for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties. This should not be seen as outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible conduct. Ultimately, the Sheas erred in undermining their claim and undermined their strength of the claim.","They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim.

2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. The accused claimed self-defence and that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt any or all of the charges against him, being that of aggravated assault, by wounding, by using or threatening to use a weapon, and that of possessing a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. HELD: The Court found that the accused committed an assault without justification or provocation. Even if S.41(2) is not applicable, the accused was under no imminent danger and there was no need to move toward the accused and strike him to defend himself.","The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence.

b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The plaintiff brought this action pursuant to s. 39 of the Act. The action was dismissed for reimbursement. 1)SGI elected not to reinstate the motor vehicle. 2)The plaintiff was not aware of the 20% deduction for depreciation until he attended to the repair shop to pick up the vehicle. The repairs were complete at that time. The roving appraiser appraised the damage, provided an appraisal which included the deduction of depreciation and advised Crestview. 3)The insurer was not required to pay the plaintiff for the repairs. 4)The statutory scheme is quite clear. An election under the Motor Vehicle Act is an election under which the insurer is bound to reinstitute. In this case, the insurer elected to pay for the entire repair of the vehicle without the knowledge or involvement of the insured. The insurance policy having in effect become contract to repair the insurer's liability for the damage is a measurement of the plaintiff benefit and the defendant's obligation. However, the clarity of this scheme is clouded by a statutory condition which adds an additional element to the statutory limits placed on the insurer by its conduct.","A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident.

HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to.

d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable.

The appellant argues this was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of the appellant's fee is reasonable and equitable. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. 1) The appellant fails to establish there is a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the administration of justice generally, to warrant a determination by the Court of Appeal. 2) The order appealed from was simply a procedural order that was designed to allow the appellant to pay the disputed account of non-party relating to matters wholly unconnected to the action. The order is discretionary in nature and each of the grounds of MLG is bound to fail. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. 3) There was no issue of importance requiring the attention of the Court on the issue of the evidence or information upon which the Administrative Judge relied. Both parties relied on hearsay evidence and an application for directions is simply an informal procedural step to ensure the Verification process moves along. There are no issues of importance required to be considered in leave applications as articulated in Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. v.

The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the appeal should be allowed on three grounds: the application was not made promptly or in time; (delay in bringing the application to strike, is obviously not an issue in this case).

The desirability of maintaining supervisory jurisdiction over administrative tribunals by superior courts also appears now to be an open question in Canadian law.

9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 1) The defendants did not deny it, although they did require the crown to prove it, as has been done. They say the bylaws of the resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as a abuse of that process. 2) The municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, and that is so because they have been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 3) The Municipality took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that it was the landowner with the responsibility to prevent trespass, whether or not they became owners of the reserve, and the civil liabilities of the interested parties for trespass to public or municipal reserves are not directly in issue. The municipality did not act out of respect for law, or for pressures to enforce s. 197 or s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the said Act. 4) In the case of subdivisions created after their transfer from the Province to the Municipality, the municipality was responsible for policing, enforcing, and preventing trespass, although, 'politically', it might not be liable to refuse. 5) In some cases, cottage lots do not go to the high water mark. 6) There are access walkways to such public reserves, between cottage lots, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey, one would not even be likely to realize that a public reserve exists, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing on cottage lots. 7) There is no evidence that the municipality ever sought or sought permission to build anything on the reserve. 8) There was no evidence to suggest that any of the defendants, or anyone else,","The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay.

5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","HELD: The Court held that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially. The ITO did not disclose grounds to authorize search for items as described, and the search of the computer immediately without further authorization and without providing their return to the justice as set out in the final lines of the search. The Court found that the search was done without authority concerned insufficiency of ITO on which the decision to issue the search warrant was made, and alleged unreasonableness of the issuing justice's decision. The court also found that there was no evidence of a breach of the accused’s right to due process.","The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v.

The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that his father's intention to name him as beneficiary of a mutual fund was defeated by the negligence of the defendants, Nordstrom and Dataplan Securities Ltd. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for 50 percent of the value of the investment at maturity. The defendant shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of the plaintiff to the date that judgment and his costs to be taxed. 1)The defendant was professional who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the plaintiff was provided in the course of his business. He had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of Mayer's intent to benefit Garry was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by Nordstrom are frequently used as estate planning tools why else would there be a beneficiary designation? The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party would bear the loss. 2)The plaintiff suffered damages as a result of Nordstrom's negligence. He was ordered to have prejudgments interest for the sum of $34,250.55. The plaintiff had prejudgment interests from the time of the death of his father to his date of birth. 3)Given the defendant's knowledge of the deceased's intent, his failure to advance products that would meet that intent, and his reliance on Mayer fathoming that the beneficiary designation made was void in law, all evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge his duty of care to the deceased and consequently, his negligence. The court found that the defendant was aware that the deceased wished to designate him as a beneficiary of the fund but failed to take these steps. 4)Given that Nordstrom was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sells life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company, he and his client had a business relationship from 1981 to 1987 during which time Mayer purchased life insurance and made investments. In 1993, Mayer purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for lump sum premium of $60,000, naming Garry as its beneficiary. When the annuity matured in 1994, it was withdrawn by Mayer and deposited to his own account. It was Nordstrom who recommended the purchase of units in Trimark Select Balanced Fund, mutual fund which had shown good performance.

b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. The parties have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. The petitioner is involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither is able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. HELD: 1) Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, supra, both children of the marriage qualify as 'child' under the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child. The respondent should pay the Table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post -secondary expenses not covered by student loans.  2) The petitioner's income in 2000 and 2001 was $18,000 per annum out of total living expenses, exclusive of source deductions. Given that the respondent will be relieved from contributing to much of their education expenses, it is argued that it would be unfair that he should also receive full advantage of their employment earnings. 3) The Court of Appeal held that it was appropriate to calculate arrears for the period July to December 2001. 4) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,153 per month based upon the respondent's income. The court found that in the circumstances at hand, the children were not dependent upon their parents during the summer months and have the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school. The Court also found that it is not inappropriate to determine the child's child support obligation in accordance with s. 3(2)(a) of the Guidelines.","Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written questions.

c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT. The real issue in this application is whether Saskatchewan Mutual Insurance Company (SMI) was in a special relationship of insurer with the plaintiffs that carried a duty of good faith and fair dealing. The plaintiffs are policy holders of the defendant SMI. This policy is not an issue in the action commenced by the plaintiffs and is not relied on for coverage in respect of the claim. SMI is the insurer for the defendants and is involved in this claim by virtue of a policy of insurance with the defendants. The defendant farmers had insurance coverage for this type of loss and turned the claim over to SMI to be dealt with. There was no allegation of an increased loss as result of this claim. HELD: 1) The claim against SMI was struck in its entirety. It was not an absolute obligation giving rise to an automatic claim for consequential damages in the event of any failure to make timely payment in accordance with the policy. The broader interpretation urged by the appellants could have far-reaching effects for the insurance industry. In some cases, the risk of being found liable for damages resulting from unsuccessfully contesting a claim against the first defendants would constitute a substantial disincentive for insurers to deny claims, even those which they reasonably and in good faith consider to be either unfounded or inflated. 2) There is no evidence that SMI has an implied contractual covenant to deal with its insureds vis-à-vis the party making a claim. Rather, it has a duty in tort, distinct from the cause of action founded on the express terms of the policy and that is not restricted by the limits in the policy, which would not advance the law or the public interest. 3) It is common ground that the proper approach to the Rule 7-9 for striking a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause is found in Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990] SCC, [1991] A.J. No. 983 (Q.D.L.R. (4th) 687 (Ont. C.A.). The court found that a breach of the contract of insurance between SMI and the plaintiffs would create an impossible situation for the insurer to avoid paying out on claims or minimizing the amounts paid. It also found that an amendment under Rule 165 should not be allowed if the result would be pleading that could be struck pursuant to Rule 173.","HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it.

Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence."

The court will look at all the circumstances in deciding whether the grant the grant of the application. The plaintiffs were equal partners in the defendant’s business. The relationship between the two shareholders broke down and in November 1997, the defendant was ordered to liquidate the defendant.

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT.

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.

HELD: The Court found that the accused was a long term offender, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender, and that there must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability. The Court also found that there was a significant difference between the accused's current status and that of someone who would normally have been found a 'dangerous offender' and a person who was on probation at the time all of these offences were committed, having been released from custody on Sept. 21, 1992. A review of the law at the outset was held to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of the accused eventually being controlled in the community, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in Part XXIV of the Code have been interpreted recently by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Appeal Court of Appeal.","The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender.

2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","The issue arises pursuant to s.50(14)(c) of the Agricultural Implements Regulations.

Indeed, they were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties. That is not the same as the Receiver seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. There are no facts in dispute that the defendants stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. 3) There is no basis to contend that the kinds of articles involved were in any way unique. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by TD and Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by the NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for. 4) The parties contend that ss.51(2), (3), and (4) serve in the interests of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. It is not in dispute the defendant stood as a successor to TD and CNH Canada and the Company that are successors to them.

The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income.

Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but had amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under ss.23 of the Act, and an order granting them custody. The children were identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: The agency applied for and was granted custody of the children. Pursuant to s.31, the agency requested personal service of this decision be provided to each of those individuals within 15 days of receipt of it. The amended application was granted. 1)Each child was in need of protection pursuant to ss.11(b) and s.17(b). As the first option was unavailable, the question was whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The revised plan being proposed by the agency was appropriate in these circumstances. 2)The father, having agreed to a long-term order, had consented to a lesser order. The father was clear that he was unable to care for the children and indicated that he intended to continue to provide a stable and nurturing environment for them. As all individuals involved are members of and live on the same First Nation, continuing contact between the father and his children is more easily accommodated. The Agency's revised plan is appropriate in the circumstances. 3)The evidence before the agency clearly indicates that the father does wish to have a continuing relationship with the children, and that he clearly recognizes that he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable or nurturing environment.","A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. The issue of whether these orders should be made retroactive was reserved and the sole issue now before the Court. HELD: The court finds that the circumstances leading to the award of retroactive child support are not the same as ongoing support. The parties' incomes were similar to what they had been in 1992 and the children continued to spend substantial portion of their time with their mother. The court weighs all of the objectives set out in s. 17 of the Divorce Act and the factors to be taken into consideration.","In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month.

2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19 as am. He applies for an order excluding evidence of cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter, (the Charter) were violated. HELD: 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. 7 of the Act was infringed. 2) The evidence was excluded from s. 24(2). 3) The Court found that the accused had reasonable expectation of privacy in his vehicle.

4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment.

The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $8,864 to be paid in the event of a condition existing the effective date of this policy.

2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case.

c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act.

The determination of credibility does not involve the court opting for the decision of R. v. Baril, 1979 CanLII 227 (BC CA), 20 B.C.A.C.; nor does it involve the Court opting for an automatic disqualification and surrender of driver’s license. 5) It would be reasonable for the accused, given that his liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration, given the current state of his driving record.","The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then.

She was injured when the defendant hit her from behind while operating the vehicle. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant was estopped from claiming a repayment of the money it had paid her under Schedule B of the Paris insurance policy. The defendant argued that by failing to indicate any interest in claiming repayment of those benefits until after the commencement of the litigation, the defendant caused the wife to 'alter her position to her detriment' by continuing to accept the money. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded costs of $140 for the loss of income from employment for the period during which the defendant suffered substantial inability to perform the essential duties of the occupation or employment provided by the defendant pursuant to Schedule 'B'. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff $140 per week for 129 weeks. This amount was to be paid to the plaintiff on the basis of what the plaintiff testified to be misrepresentation and unprovable assertions. The court found that the plaintiff had not shown that she was employed at the time of the accident and that she did not show that she worked for any six months out of the preceding 12 months and so did not fall within the deeming provisions.","The defendant was found liable.

The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The child was placed in the permanent care and custody of the maternal grandmother, who was a convicted child abuser whose name appeared on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of the conviction. The father, V.M., who lived with his maternal grandmother in the Halifax area, lived with the paternal grandmother and had three children of his own, one of whom was now eight years old. The maternal grandmother had access to the child by court order, supervised only, but there was evidence he had the care of his son in an unsupervised situation. The child's mother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. HELD: The child was granted custody under s. 41(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. An order was made under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the paternal grandparent who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion. The court reviewed the circumstances of the two children and found that there was a bond between the paternal and maternal grandmother and that the child was in need of protection who would ideally be placed for adoption.

The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.

The Court ordered that his executor's file be delivered to the court. The respondent appealed. He argued that the Court erred in granting an order without first requiring proof of and making determination of whether the appellant was wasting the estate, or without determining that an executor has the same right and authority to control the assets of the estate as the testatrix would have if living, unless and until, there is proof that such a person is wasting his or her time.","The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act.

d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32.

There is no record of it, as far, as loan documentation goes. The accounting records do not show it as wages advanced as testified to by the defendant. 2) The counterclaim as to the $2,400.00 is not proven. No evidence was put forward by Lilia that supports that these payments were not consented to and agreed to.  3) Lilia's testimony as to working four hours a day with one day off for eight days was not accepted. There was no evidence to support this allegation. 4) The $5,000 was a loan, as there's no loan documentation prepared and/or signed which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. The plaintiff is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the record of employment.  5) As the amount of the damages is not known, the defendant has not made out, on balance of probabilites, if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. It may be that there are no damages incurred if she becomes eligible for payment.  6) The defendant claims that there is actually a loan given, as well as a cash advance and a repayment of the advance, which there is no basis to withhold the $960 from Christos on his last cheque.  7) The accountant testified that he was unhappy about Lilia being asked to work less hours by her doctor, and one of the reasons she was dismissed was that she did not have 600 hours of insurable employment which she had in mind, in order to collect maternity leave benefits.  8) The plaintiff filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there is nothing to support that the plaintiff could have made a verbal loan with the defendants.  9) The accountants did not put forth any information to support the allegation that the defendant ever asked Lilia for funds back for expenses incurred by her.","HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff.

HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISLA) for a declaration of paternity and child support.

There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education was 'unreasonable'. The Court will impute income in the same fashion that it did before the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 2) The Court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. It will not be presumed simply because the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because the standard of living of the applicant is lower than that of the other spouse. The court must establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income.

The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital and required the insurer to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. A trial judge found that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that the insurer was not responsible for the loss. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser Brace by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire loss it had no liability to the Province or Fraser's Brace for causing the loss and in summary there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. There had been no breach of contract between the respondent and the appellant. 2)The appellant had no obligation to the respondent to pay the fire as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser‑Brace, was always at risk for fire loss to the province's property. 3)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence of the appellant causing the fire nor any suggestion that it caused it. 4)The respondent's claim for compound interest was rejected by the trial judge.","This was an appeal of a decision declaring that the respondent was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant. Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed a rental van stopped on a grid road leading to a tourist information booth. As he approached the vehicle, he noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and asked if he could empty his pockets. When the officer asked if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused responded that he was looking for a place to relieve himself, the officer told the accused he had two cases of wine in the back of the van and asked him if he needed any assistance. The accused said he did not require a warrant as he felt that if he left the van on the grid road while he went to get a warrant he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence of bringing more than 1.14 litres of wine into the province and exigent circumstances existed in that it was necessary to conduct a search before the accused drove away with the evidence. The search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law and the fact that the target of the detention was in an automobile did not enhance the police power to detain that individual.",The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police.

The complainant testified that she did not believe the accused when he told her that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question, that he did not go to K.S.'s bedroom and that he never had contact with her. The accused elected trial by way of indictment on both charges. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the evidence of the complainant as to what transpired in the bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was not credible. The evidence on the other side of the argument was not supported by the evidence on either side. The court found that there was no evidence that the accused had pulled the blanket away from her or that he removed his pants when she told the officer that she didn't know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants.

3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.","The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act.

Pshyk. 2)Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in the original document, he would not have challenged the Crown on his failure to made mention of it. 3)Had the Crown referred to the Checksheet, the accused would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the re-direct examination which occurred in this case. 4)Had it known the full contents of the original check sheet, he could have challenged it. Had he known that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence, the defence would have been able to challenge it. 5)The Court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on the part of either the accused or the accused. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the operational Chechsheets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown's agent. That is because, had he known about the reference, under the heading Observations on Subject, the Crown would have referred to Exhibit P-2. The original checksheet did not have a section entitled observations on Subject or section for the technician's name. 6)The officer did not make any notation in his notes or in his General Occurrence Report about his observations of the accused after his arrest and at the RCMP detachment. That would have inevitably drawn an inquiry which occurred. 7)The trial judge should only exclude evidence for late disclosure in exceptional cases: (a)where the trial process unfair and this unfairness cannot be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or (b) where exclusion is necessary to maintain the integrity of the justice system. This is not a case where bad faith is the cause.","The accused was charged with impaired care or control.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1)."

Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act.

The wife must absorb the additional cost of child care in his care. The husband's obligation to support the minor child in the care must be absorbed by the child in his custody. Where there are significant disparities in the wife’s incomes, such as in the absence of a substantial income adjustment, the wife must take immediate steps to absorb the immediate cost of her child care expenses.

HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused stands charged that he consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, had the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: 1) The facts were in the mind of the officer when he decided to make the demand, whether he was of the opinion that the taking of the blood samples from the accused would not endanger his life or health, whether the doctor had acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life of his patient, and whether he would have acted to ensure that the blood sample was taken by a qualified medical practitioner or under the supervision of a medical practitioner. 2) The evidence was in relation to a visit by the officer at the hospital and not at his home. The doctor testified that he relied on police officers and trusts them. The officer testified that if he said it was okay to take the sample, he would not have done so. 3) There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that either the doctor took the samples himself or the technician took them under the direction of the doctor. The evidence at trial disclosed that the medical practitioner had no recollection of having the doctor complete the wrong form (P-2). The medical practitioner testified that the doctor advised him that it would be okay to do so. 4) The Court was left with reasonable doubt as to whether the officer acted beyond reasonable doubt on the facts. The facts in this case did amount to reasonable and probable grounds for his doing so.","In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. The admission of the Certificate of Analyses would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. 2) There was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, from 'fleeting and technical to profoundly invasive'. The more serious the effect of the breach on the accused's right to contact counsel, the greater the risk that the admission of a breath sample would bring to the administration. 3) There is little in the accused’s testimony upon which to determine the impact of the detention upon him. There was nothing to indicate he could not have made the demand forthwith, even though the device itself was not yet present. In the alternative, the accused submits his rights under s. 8, 9, 10 and 14 of the Charter.  4) The Court found that there was a reasonable limit to the time between the demand to provide breath sample into an ASD and the taking of the sample was 11 minutes.","The accused was charged with driving over .08.

The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.

The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","This appeal arises from a decision of the Adjudicator in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia who convicted the appellant for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The adjudicator made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence of three other witnesses, his son Dennis Guthro who testified it was he who drove the car but that his son was in the vehicle. The appeal centers upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the Crown's evidence and the reliability of the evidence, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant was not the driver. HELD: The appeal of the conviction is allowed. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility.

Absent an error of law or miscarriage of justice, the test to be applied by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court is whether the findings of the trial judge are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Given the experience of both the appellant and the other witnesses and the credibility of the defence witness, the Court was unable to determine whether the appellant's evidence was sufficiently credible to warrant an acquittal.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.

b_2011skpc19.txt,"The accused was a passenger in a van where the driver was stunting on the complainant's street. The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and of unlawfully assaulting a peace officer. The accused had used more force than was necessary to defend himself, which took him out of the protection afforded to him by s. 34 of the Code. The Court also found that even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more than is necessary to protect himself, taking him into the breach of the peace protection afforded him by ss. 34(1)(a) and s. 266(2). The accused was found guilty of the aggravated assault on the peace officer on count 1. HELD: 1) There was no evidence offered by the accused to contradict any Crown evidence and the evidence considered by me left him convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he was acting the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene, to prevent the continuation of the breach. 2) The Court was left with the issue of whether the accused's defence of self defence was available to him and whether he was properly identified and properly acting as police officer in the line of duty at the time the assault took place. It was not clear to the bystander that the assault could have been caused by the assault. It is also not clear if the accused had an objective foresight of bodily harm, that results from the actions of an accused.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer.

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

The defendants counterclaim for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. HELD: The Court finds that the delay in this case is full nine years after the cause of action arose. The plaintiff's lawyer had stated the nature of the claim to the defendants in his letter of 30 October 1992. It is presumed that this was done on the instructions of Cluett. The defendant was prevented from determining what, if any, old records would have been germane to the defence of the plaintiff's action. The Court also finds that there is a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would be.  1)The Court is satisfied that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to the plaintiff respecting time limitations. However, in mid November 2001 the defendant's storage warehouse was destroyed by fire and the defendant lost many old records including those relating to Metro and the Maritime Motel. 2)The plaintiff's diligence is consistent with s.2(2)s focus on what is equitable. It will generally be less equitable for limitation defence to defeat the claim of diligent plaintiff than of one who has sat back on his or her rights.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate.

8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions.

The Court also found that without the assistance of s.6 and the other amending provisions of the Act, the plaintiff was awarded one set of costs only to be shared equally and paid within 30 days. The court found that the application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and expense.  1) The Court reviewed the history of the Saskatchewan class action and found that although Saskatchewan was the most appropriate venue for the certification of multi-jurisdictional class action claims, it was also the most restrictive jurisdiction in the country. 2) There were significant geographic and other scopes to the Saskatchewan action, including a far wider list of damaging “substances”, a larger group of defendants and a broader scope of causes of action. 3) It was important to note that the Saskatchewan Act was amended in 2007 to provide for a more holistic approach to certification.

He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible.

Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for 3 D.N.A. Warrants. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 19-year-old child. While it may be appropriate at some point to order the blood sample be obtained notwithstanding any parental non-consent, it is questionable whether it could be concluded at present that it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the child would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding. The Court is of the view that there should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father of the child and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking. Paragraph 3(C) does not set out the relationship to the parties of the named informant nor why the information provided by the informant is considered reliable. There is nothing from the natural mother positively stating that no other person could be the father of this child. The last page and half of the Information in Support refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the child was born. The proper inference to be drawn from the words 'associated with' is that set out in the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10th edition (1999), viz: “be involved with”. While there may be an opportunity to order DNA analysis of blood samples, which is based on blood or other bodily substances of the alleged father and the alleged mother, the facts as alleged fall within and meet the requirements of the Code. It would appear that insofar as the probative benefits of DNA analysis are concerned, the crucial determination will be whether the father or mother have the requisite number of matching DNA characteristics; the DNA of the baby would then provide further confirmation or negation of the incestuous relationship. Given the naturalmother's allegation as to the birth father, and the latter's denial of her paternity, the information, if any, contained in the Registration of Live Birth concerning the biological father would be of assistance in providing a complete picture for the Court.

The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer.

This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to the Bank. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it obtained priority to the leased equipment. The business of leasing which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was the only business of Patchrite and thereafter continued to be a significant part of its business. HELD: The Court found that Patchrite was regularly engaged in the leasing of personal property within the meaning of s.2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s3. The lease in question was a lease for a term of more than 1 year and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Court concluded that the owner/landlord's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the bank. The issue to be decided by the Court was which of the two companies had priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease.","The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite.

These issues will only be resolved in the context of findings of credibility. Such matters do not readily lend themselves to resolution on an Interlocutory application. It is from that dismissal that ABS appeals. 3) The judge erred in striking the appellant’s affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant.

d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence and that of the two young children presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: 1) An application to change residence on an interim basis was granted.  2) The father is currently incarcerated. He opposes the move, and in any event wants access. This is an exceptional case. 3) The mother's move with the children would mean nothing to the children in terms of their frequency of contact with their father, or with any increased difficulties in exercising access. There should, however, be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. The parties should explore with corrections authorities the prospect of communication through Skype, FaceTime, or one of the other means of electronic audio/visual communication. The mother is the only available parent for the foreseeable future. When the father is eligible to get out of jail, he will not have close ties to his children for a period approaching 2 years. There is no reasonable basis to have matters resolved in the father's favour. 4) There was a material change of circumstances affecting the children. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives. This should be considered. 5) It appears beyond dispute that the mother has always been the primary caregiver to these children. Here, the father has been in jail since September 2012, first on remand, then as serving prisoner. He will be eligible for early release in December 2013.

He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible.

The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.

The Court found that the Committee's decision was based primarily on the credibility of the witnesses and the absence of any explanation for the failure to remit the rental to the applicant.

The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change.

The applicant has operated the club since June 1997 and has had a special premises liquor license granted by the province of Nova Scotia. That license has allowed the sale of liquor, subject to certain restrictions including the following: 4) This license is for the use of members of the club only and not the general public; and 5) The change of the liquor license sought by the applicant will constitute a change in use requiring a development permit. This is against that background that the modern regime of land use controls, with their inherent tension between the owner's desire to put its own property to what it regards as the optimal use and the municipality's interest in having all of the land within its boundaries organized in plan which it thinks will maximize the benefits for all inhabitants.

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books.

A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered.

The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials.

The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials. He found that ITI selected the books in issue and that, therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject to an agreement for sale. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials and the fact that the company acknowledged that changes'may be made during the course of the student's program.'

ITI retained discretion under its contract to its students as to what courses it would supply. However, it was not obliged by the contract to provide certain materials. It acknowledged that'materials may be changed from one time to another' and such changes were 'necessary' for the school's program'. 3)The court found that the order was not'subject to an 'agreement for sale' within the meaning of s.81.1(1)(c)(v) and that the judge had not found otherwise.","Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books.

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time.

The facts pleaded in para.50 are material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and any resulting moral damages. 3) The defendants' references to members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club in paragraph 67 would lead reasonable people to believe that the defendants acted unfairly or in bad faith by terminating the plaintiff's employment while he was suffering from prostate cancer. Further, these facts were material to defamation because they contain indirect quotes attributable to the defendant. 4) The Court was satisfied that the essence and spirit of the current rules do not materially differ from the former rules. 5) The pleadings of media outlets are treated with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision as opposed to actually pleading those material facts. 6) The plaintiffs plead facts which, if proven, would establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that raises the presence of bad faith in the defendants' dismissal of the plaintiffs. 7) The application seeks the following relief: 7) Rules 13-9 (1) (c) (d) (e) (f) and (f).

The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The accused's computer was seized and the search warrant was abandoned right from the start. The very reason for obtaining the warrant is abandoned. 2)It is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than a search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities. This information never found its way into his report. The presence of this potential corroboration evidence obviated the need for the search history information. 3)There is no evidence on this trial that the accused had any discussions with any other officers prior to completing his analysis of the computer. While protocol has changed, in July 2013, he was not required to review the warrant or ITO as part of his analysis. The evidence from the voir dire was forwarded to Cst. Logan for review and determination. In the alternative, the accused seeks to exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. 4)There are several problems with this evidence. The first is the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice, but the impact of failing to admit the evidence. 5)The second problem is the absence of any evidence of the complainant's presence on the accused’s computer. The only evidence of her presence was that of a laptop computer. This is particularly the case where, as here, the computer is used to browse the Web. The Information to Obtain [ITO] in support of the warrant sought only search of the internet history. There is no indication in the evidence that picture or pictures of anyone who might be the complainant would contain those “hash values.” This information was not included in the ITO. 6)The third issue is whether the admission of evidence obtained by a Charter breach would bring the Administration of justice into disrepute.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.

The plaintiff had no reason to be scrupulously careful about the position of his finger because he was unaware of the waiver term. 2)There was no evidence that the delay in the decision made any difference, and in particular, it was not shown that earlier amputation would have saved more of the finger. 3)The defendant was not liable for the damage suffered by the plaintiff as a consequence of the plaintiff's negligence in allowing his finger near the spray nozzle. 4)Costs and pre-judgment interest were limited because the plaintiff ought to have brought the matter on for trial more expeditiously.","He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer.

6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.","The landlord appeals a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate. The tenants reluctantly accepted termination even though it was short notice and thereafter applied under the Act for the return of their security deposit and other damages. The landlord contends he was not given opportunity to be heard, or to adequately respond to the tenants’ claim. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The hearing officer erred by failing to give the landlord an opportunity to respond. The tenant failed to properly identify which area of the unit was unusable, failed to describe the relief sought or the nature of argument they intended to advance. 2)The tenant’s strategic miscalculation does not amount to an error on the part of the Hearing Officer. The decision on rent abatement was made on a principled and logical basis having regard to the facts. The purpose of the award was to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended in part to compensate for inconvenience and aggravation, and in part as compensatory loss for related expenses. Both awards were reasonable on both fact and law, accordingly. The hearing officer found no reviewable error by the officer.","The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses.

9_1998canlii12399.txt,"The issue on appeal was reduced to whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized Nickel to sell the mobile home as contemplated by s28(1) or, if not authorized, did he sell the mobile home in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. HELD: The respondent's security interest continued to take priority over the respondent's. The trial judge concluded that Lanson did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of the P.P.S.A., and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. The appellant relied heavily on Canadian Commercial Bank v. Tisdale Farm Equipment Ltd., which was restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor that he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secure party.

The evidence submitted by the respondents to date does not do this. 3)The respondent has not established that the land in the period prior to August of 1992 met the definition of farm land. The farm credit corporation fell into that category. To be homestead, there must be a bona fide farm residence and the land on which such residence sits must be used for 'farming purposes'. 4)HELD: There was no recent appraisals available. 5)The Court considered it reasonable to adjourn the application to June 7, 2001 at a time to be set by the local registrar.

The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister.

e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club Inc., and the defendants.

He was burned when gasoline from the gas tank located behind the driver's seat of the vehicle he was driving splashed on him and was set on fire shortly afterwards, after he had signalled his desire to have the contest halted and his vehicle had come to stop. The damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2)Had the case been permitted to go to trial, the jury could have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the respondents as on the appellant, and the damage could have been seen to be caused by the respondent. 3)The respondent's failure to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he observed would have resulted in less serious burns than he would have suffered. 4)The evidence was taken for the purposes at hand to have established the damage was caused by both the respondent's actions and the actions of the flagman and the fire department. 5)The court could not rationally have concluded either the respondent caused or caused the damage attributable to the appellant or the respondent, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would not have suffered as serious burns as they turned out to be. 6)The issue was whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence.","This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs."

The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, possession of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking and failure to comply with a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court meeting. The accused was sentenced to six months deferred custody on all three counts. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38 of the YCJA. HELD: 1) Clearly, his previous sentence of probation as imposed by Judge Tucker on August 20, 2012, based on a conviction of possession for the use of cocaine, had failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society. The amount of cocaine that the accused had possession was significant. The role of the accused in the trafficking operation - in this case the evidence would seem to indicate that Mr. L. was the one and only person involved, although one would certainly suspect the driver of the motor vehicle knew what was going on. 2) The accused had a lengthy criminal record and had served time in custody for drug trafficking offences. He had served nine months pre-trial custody and had sold in excess of $10,000 worth of heroin on 13 different occasions. He was only one month into a custodial disposition when he was back in La Ronge selling cocaine. 3) The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking operation was financial gain. The most aggravating factor that has the potential to move this offence into the exceptional case category is the fact that the Court was only 1 month into the probation order and had been bound by the terms of that order, which included a mandatory prohibition order, that he was to stay out of the Province unless he had the permission of the Court, and that the Crown did not want the accused coming back to the community to sell narcotics. 4) There was little to no evidence that this activity was designed to feed an addiction to cocaine.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation.

The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.

The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home.

The amount he was required to pay under the 1995 judgment was $2,500 per month. He was unemployed and no longer received the substantial salary that he had enjoyed. The respondent was now over 65 years old and received Canada Pension and Old Age Security benefits. HELD: The applicant met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating that there had been a material change in circumstances since the 1995 order. The applicant was granted leave to apply for variation application in couple of years when the status of his employment income will be known. There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent.

A trial of the issue was ordered.  1)It is significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in the future financial position of the parties. 2)The parties had three children and the respondent had retired from the matrimonial home. Although she had some employment income during the marriage, she now qualified for Old Age Pension benefits that are currently $417 per month and her retirement savings including those that represent his pension will be depleted by the year 2011. 3)Although it is obviously not the law that appropriate Spousal Support levels are determined by equalizing the incomes of couples who have divorced and their respective needs and means, it is essential that the parties know now what their future obligations will be.  4)The applicant had no employment income at the time the agreement was made.

The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000. The defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff.

The amount expended by party for investigating or gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim.

There was considerable “down time” between many of the expert medical witnesses. One lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty. That, however, could not have been known in advance.

The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid.

He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography.

b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The accused was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. At that transfer hearing, the entire issue of when the offences occurred can be examined and the choice of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges can be made in the absence of the requirement to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction after he found the alleged offences could have occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). The Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and found that the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, a youth court, as opposed to an ordinary court. It also considered whether the Crown should apply for a transfer hearing under s.16 of the Act to determine whether the accused's alleged offences occurred when he was a young offender or adult. It would appear there are no adverse consequences to applying for an order under s16.","The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).","The parties married in 1995 and separated in 2006.

The respondent has suffered a dramatic drop in income and is no longer in a shared parenting arrangement. HELD: The Court will consider the spousal and child support obligations of the respondent and whether they are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgment. The principal basis for the respondent's argument is (1) a significant reduction in his income, and (2) a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the separation agreement.

The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child.

HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child.

The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction. HELD: The Crown's appeal is dismissed. 1) There was no evidence upon which the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was a novelty sword. No attempt was made by the Crown to call evidence to contradict his testimony. 2) The trial judge relied on the accused's evidence that he had just purchased the sword and was taking it home to display in his room or on his television. On this basis, she concluded that the evidence was relevant to the trial judge's determination with respect to the usual use of this type of item.  3) The Crown must start with the premise that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima facie a weapon. A knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches and ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively. There is nothing to show that the knife in question was designed to be used by a weapon: when it is closed, it is as innocuous as any other type of weapon. The judge properly placed Mr. Maguire's evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. 4) The accused testified that he bought the sword from someone named 'Froggy'. As he had no bag or back pack in which to carry it, he tucked it into his shorts. He cannot recall whether he was alone or with someone. The officer drew his firearm and instructed the accused to place his hands on his head. He slowly lay on his stomach, with his hands out to his sides. He had a strong odour of liquor on his breath and slurred his speech. Under cross-examination, the accused gave further evidence about the sword. He was aware that it was readily available in novelty stores and that it had been of interest to people as decorative item. The accused was not testifying as to his eye witness perceptions but about where it could be purchased.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon.

b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years.

HELD: The plaintiffs were awarded injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had been ongoing for the past nine years. The Town was ordered to pay $18,000 for loss of use and enjoyment of their property for 7 months of the year and $6,000 to settle the claim by Bosenberg and Strassburg who continue to have the same problem. 1) The plaintiffs refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. 2) The defendant optionor could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiff's claim for damages against the defendant was dismissed. 4) It would appear that the defendants have advanced no expert evidence to support the proposition that the golf balls hitting from the adjacent golf course are a nuisance and continue to be a nuisance. 5) There is no doubt that the present operation of Emerald Park Golf and Country Club is a nuisance, and continues to be so. 6) The defendants' failure to comply with the plaintiff’s recommendations did not constitute a continuing nuisance. 7) There was no evidence that the plaintiff anticipated the extent of the existing problem. The plaintiff was not prepared to rely on expert evidence or the recommendations of the various course managers as to how this would affect his or her property.","The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course.

The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months.

In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court was not satisfied that the prospective appeal as a whole was not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being was not necessary in the public interest. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. Moreover, the Supreme Court is not satisfied the prospective appeals as a package are not frivolous. The prospective appeal is likely to be determined in the next 3 or 4 months. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to public confidence in the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the potential for the applicant to succeed either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served.",The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision.

6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for a bond contained in s.55(1) of the Act. The court has heard submissions that some bonding companies are requiring five-year premium payable in advance on the basis the risk is too great for a one year premium. In many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets which equal or exceed the value of the estate to be administered. The four children who are not applicants consent to the application without a necessity of bond. 2) The application to be appointed personal decision makers is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. There have been enough defalcations by previous property guardians, which is why it was given a larger role to play in the new legislation. Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so. If the applicant is from out of province, or was not beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, or if there was opposition within the family to the appointment, then the court application may be brought. 3) There is a cost associated with involving the public trustee as a property guardian in the estate of the subject adult. The onus is on the person making an application for property guardianship without the necessary of bond to persuade the court that it is appropriate, bearing in mind the object of the legislation which is to ensure that the money in this estate is always available for the adult's ongoing care. The public trustee should be consulted in advance of the court's application being served as to whether there is any common ground on the type of surety that would be acceptable, including the financial disclosure required to support the same, or to determine if the court is prepared to consent to it. Leave to consult with the Public trustee in advance will certainly eliminate significant costs for the applicants in having to litigate every application with the trustee.","FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship.

6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped at an intersection for several south-bound vehicles to go by. Before turning left, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, this one a 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth. HELD: 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. 2)The court found that the defendant did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failure to yield, the defence of due diligence was established. 3)The evidence of the drivers and their passengers and to all of the circumstances did not suggest a reasonable amount of skill in the handling of a vehicle which is a potential source of danger to other users of the road. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. It means that if vehicle has the right to proceed, then it must be allowed to proceed first.","A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act.

c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT. The applicants sought an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council on May 7, 2007 that the school be closed effective August 15, 2007.

With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address.

Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel.

The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not.

Questions on the availability of alternative forms of transportation, the cost of such alternatives, the dependability of the alternatives and the safety of the airliners are all relevant.

The respondent's gross annual income for the years 1996 to 1997 was sufficient to enable him to pay child support under the order. However, he was not in a position to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the Order and therefore was not able to reduce the arrears accrued during such period. 3) The petitioner's gross income was $22,993.

Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to the variation of maintenance payable prior to 1996. 5) There was no evidence the petitioner had access during any of the years 1993 to 1997. 6) It was not appropriate for the respondent to have access on the terms heretofore stated. 7) The terms of the Family Maintenance Act s.10 (the Act) did not deal with the issue of access. 8) It is not appropriate to impose conditions on the access of the respondent. 9) The father was not available to answer the court's questions as to access. 10) The mother's income in the years 1997 to 1998 was $21,974.

Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school."
d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000. The arbitrator found that the wording of Article 9:01 is wide enough to encompass this situation. The person with the less hotel seniority was the one who should have their hours reduced, not me. HELD: The appeal was granted. 1)The arbitrator’s conclusion was patently unreasonable. It was as indefinite as if there was a reduction of hours overall within the department. This interpretation also adheres to the long held principle that “the purpose of seniority is to afford preference to senior employees in recognition of length of service” and preserves the purpose of departmental seniority. 2)The respondent union had a grievance against the hotel based on its interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties. It argued that the interpretation of the arbitrator was not even argued before her. 3)The arbitration concluded that any reduction in work hours should instead have been predicated on hotel level. This was not a layoff situation. Rather, it was an indefinite reduction in hours within a department which was not the situation here at all. 4)The appellant was the first to experience reduction of work hours in the front desk department where she placed fourth on the departmental list behind the other three employees. The appellant had the benefit of working additional hours in her department during the maternity leave. She therefore filed a grievance on February 17, 2000 seeking to have the hotel set aside under s15(2) of the Arbitration Act.","The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave.

b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. For the reasons that follow, the Crown would dismiss the appeal. HELD: 1) The Crown failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant's speed with either the actus reus or the mens rea of the offence. 3) It was an error of law for the trial judge to confuse an issue of fact—Mr. Alves' speed—with either of the actuses reus.  4) The evidence of several witnesses who testified that they were walking their dog near Circle Drive at the time of the accident showed that the appellant was travelling at a much faster speed than he was. The trial trial judge correctly stated that speed is not an essential element of the criminal offence. It was not a matter of fact that the accused's speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He simply misunderstood the issue.  5) It is not necessary to prove a significant fault element is required in order to establish dangerous driving for the purposes of the imposition of criminal punishment. 6) The Court of Appeal was not satisfied that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the manner of driving of the accused was dangerous to the public in all the circumstances.","The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed.

2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","The defendants brought a motion pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 to have the plaintiff's claim dismissed. They also sought an order extending a limitation period nunc pro tunc. The plaintiff had a prima facie case and had commenced this action fifteen months after the stay of proceedings was entered. Dismissing the motion, that the Court of Appeal rule provides for a determination of a point of law and that the limitation period should only run after the application for leave has been made. Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation time, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. The remaining substantive issues were whether the action was barred by a statutory limitation period, whether any limitation period was extended, whether there was an allegation of malice, whether the plaintiff had commenced an action in tort against the defendants because there was no evidence of malice and whether a portion of the claim failed to disclose a cause of action. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The court found that the limitations period was not an insurmountable obstacle in the way of making a nunc-tunc order. 2)The Court found that when a statute-barred action is entered, it must be addressed fairly. 3)Rule 188 of the Public Officers' Protection Act was struck down. The Court did not find that the provisions of s.2(1)(a) of The Public Officers Protection Act (PSPA) applied to this action. The provisions of the PSPA do not apply here. Rather, they provide a mechanism for the Court to determine whether a particular action is barred by statute or not. 4)The application for an order, if necessary, extending the limitation time was not addressed in this case."," The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.

b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt 'accruing due' under the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. Other cases pertaining to similar debts must also be rationalized. In the case of the garnishee summons, the court found that the debt owing under the GIC was not a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment. The court also held that garnishment was prevented because the debt was a conditional debt and made 'a conditional one' within the meaning of s. 5(1) of the Act.","The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.

e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The father applied to vary the original Custody Judgment to allow him to have sole custody of the child. The mother opposed the father's application to be allowed to change the child's primary residence to Whitehorse. HELD: The father was granted sole custody and the mother was granted less restrictive access. The court reviewed each of the seven factors listed in Gordon v. Goertz and found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time the father applied for joint custody. The father had been granted interim custody in June 2006 and requested an order allowing him to relocate with the child for residential purposes. While the mother had opposed both applications at trial, she now indicated that she was willing to work towards joint custody and shared parenting once she demonstrated that she could be trusted not to attempt to abduct her child. There was no evidence that the father had changed his residence in Yukon since the mother's return to Saskatoon, although she had indicated that he had made the necessary inquiries and that his employment prospects there were good.","The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule.

9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum, and to make disclosure and production orders in the manner in which it has done. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. The fact that the Board conceded that two exceptions must be made indicates that this is a case where the exceptions to the general rule apply. 2)The Board acted without jurisdiction by compelling the applicant to discover documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts. The Board did not address the necessity of reviewing the transcript to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. 3)The application was brought by the interests of the parties. The parties were seeking to have the applicant's application for discovery and production dismissed. 4)The applicant was seeking the production of documents that were irrelevant to the issues that were properly before the Board. The applicant was also seeking the discovery of documents referred to by the respondent in the subpoenas tecum. The respondent had refused to supply the respondent with copies of the affidavits. 5)The respondent failed to comply with all of the conditions set out in the order. 6)It is not possible, without the proper information and context provided by the transcript, to consider the respondent's request for discovery or production. 7)The court found that the respondent did not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure or production orders. 8)It was not possible to determine the relevance of the respondent’s affidavit evidence in light of the numerous other affidavits filed by the applicant and the fact that it was not available to the Court at the time the order was issued. It was beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy of the affidavit evidence.","Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board.

The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders."

The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent with Allstate Insurance. He had been with the company for 26 years. Allstate had not, at any time, sought to justify the termination of his employment by arguing that since compensation is calculated in part on the basis of the prior month's sales, the length of service of the contract did not constitute a failure by the plaintiff to mitigate his damages. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's termination was not unreasonable. His course of conduct was not reasonable. His employment contract with the defendant incorporated a two year 'non-competition' clause which effectively increased the level of compensation on new policies written and at the same time reduced the level on renewals. 2)Had the plaintiff not acted reasonably in determining the appropriate period of notice, the plaintiff would have been entitled to compensation in the amount of $1,800 to $3,000 per month. There was no month of employment for which he was not paid. 3)Had Allstate failed to mitigate its damages in the circumstances?","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years.

The court found that the wife was not a credible witness and a further example of this was her allegation that the husband when deployed would not allot funds from his pay directly to her while he was gone.

The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded an all inclusive sum of $162,500. The figure agreed upon was the all-inclusive sum. What remains for the court to decide is whether that sum is to be paid by Allstate or by ING. The facts in this case are very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the issues of the identity of the vehicle which struck the plaintiff, the driver of that vehicle and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it. The plaintiff's version of events began to unravel. His evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. Prior to trial, counsel for the plaintiff and ING reached an agreement on the quantum of damages which shortened the trial considerably. HELD: 1) The plaintiff had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van to Ms. Marsh. He retained lawyer to prepare a Statutory Declaration to enable him to register the ownership of another vehicle in August. What remained for the Court to decide in this unusual fact situation is whether it is To be Paid or By ING or Allstate.  2) The facts were complex and there were a number of inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence. The first issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the sum agreed upon by the parties. The second issue was the credibility of the plaintiff’s claim that he was the owner of a van that had been involved in a hit and run incident and that he had no contact with the person who owned the van at the time of the incident. He had no idea that the van was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. He did not recognize the driver from the police photo line up entered in evidence as part of the police investigation file and he did not allow or authorize him to drive his van once he was alerted to it by the squeal of tires.","The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer.

The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police.

When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back.

The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","This was a motion brought by the Respondents seeking to consolidate their claim against the Defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) It is not possible at this juncture to determine the degree of commonality, in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions. 2) The pleadings clearly state each plaintiff had their own investment accounts which are subject matter of their litigation. There is no evidence before the Court to establish that the series of transactions are all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule. 3) The Court is not at this stage sufficiently furnished with information about the claims to be able to make a reasonable assessment of which issues could be tried in common and which issues have to be set to be tried individually.",",  motion denied.

The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1.

He conducted a relatively thorough review of the relevant case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making. This included Saskatchewan Director v. Mihalyko, 2009. Paragraph of his decision would suggest that the judge did consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime. To do so would narrowly cross the threshold of being draconian and manifestly unjust. 3) The Director submits that the Judge erred by considering certain information about the circumstances of the respondent and Ms. Brinkman even though that information had been submitted by those two individuals as part of their arguments rather than formally by affidavit.

She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","Following the birth of her daughter, the plaintiff was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of a sudden onset of profuse vaginal bleeding.

HELD: The Court held that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff's allegation that the operating room nurses' notes were a fabrication of something that did not happen.

He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition.

The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT.

The applicants suggest that if the preservation order issue is made, the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable damage because the fruits of any successful litigation will be no longer available at the time the litigation comes to an end, and they suggest the liened lands will not have enough value in them to satisfy judgment.",FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value.
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The accused's blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. The officer noted approximately ten to twelve beer cans on the coffee table, which got his attention because the accused had told him that he had only drank six beer throughout the day. Although the officer did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes, he was adamant that there were more than six beer cans. Based on the evidence, there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police officer who had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that Mr. Lehman did not stop. The Court was satisfied the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and that his memory, and/or version of what he drank this evening and night, and when he drank it, had changed over time. Given that finding, the Court rejected the accused's contention that he was not trying to evade the officer and accepted the evidence of the RCMP officer.","The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer.

2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act for possession of crack cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location. He was observed from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. Constable Marriott testified that he observed the accused stashing the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. His possession is constructive, done knowingly by him for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. HELD: Accused found guilty on both counts. 1)The evidence of the Crown was accepted. The Crown's evidence on the practices and encounters between the accused and the seller were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. 2)The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant stashed these drugs in a rock wall shortly after his arrest and that he had control of them. It was his stash that he placed in that rock wall in the minute following the transaction with the accused. The appellant's evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine as an explanation for the absence of the agent benedryl in the Burke stone was not supported by the evidence. 3)The Crown's motion for observation post privilege was valid. The Court was also satisfied that the evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level drug transaction was common practice in the area.","The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.

5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood contrary to ss. 10(b) and s. 24(2)(a). The trial was held in January 2012 and in March 2012, the accused was found not guilty of both charges. The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count.

b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II. HELD: 1) The application is dismissed. The Court found no retroactivity problem. 2) There is no evidence that the current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. 3) The definition of 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' is defined in s. 35.1 of the Act. Both statutes contemplate an application to this court for forfeiture of such property. Both apply the same legal test and standard of proof.","HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure.

He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. He applied to reduce his support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under his previous order.

It was also found that his child support should be based on his imputed income of $40,000 and that he should pay the net sum of $328.00 as and for the support of his child, Stephanie. 4) It was found that Mr. Pilat had not acted unreasonably or had acted in bad faith during the family law proceeding.","FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter.

HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, the Court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent husband 44%. In addition, the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousal Maintenance Order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)The respondent's claim for set-off was allowed. The Court granted him 56% and 44% of his estimated assets. 2)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of the original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. The evidence supports this position so the Court awarded the respondent's share of the value of the barley to the respondent. 3)Division of property was based on asset values which were at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. The petitioner required income to live on and the balance of the remaining farm lands, the parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and grain on hand would normally go to satisfy the unsecured creditors of the respondent under his bankruptcy. When all of the assets have been liquidated and it is determined what amount is actually available for division then it shall be divided based on the foregoing analysis 56% for the respondent and 44 percent to the wife. 4)Each side shall bear their own costs.","Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance.

He sent monthly invoices to the plaintiff who paid them as they got to pasture. No bonus was paid for the 2004-2005 year or the 2005-2006 year.

6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","This appeal concerns the application of s. 25 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in relation to a motion for deficiency judgment by the respondent bank. The respondent granted a residential mortgage to the respondent in January 2011, securing a loan in the amount of $460,000. This loan was consolidation of existing debt. Part of the debt was the balance of $373,089.00 owed on an original loan, which had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. At that time, the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72. However, the net sale proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the loan and the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of the LCRA and held that the amount owed should be $162,675.99. Hrynewich Holdings accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. The decision in Andrew (CA) is also instructive when interpreting the spirit and intent of the s. of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; the respondent is entitled to take out the deficiency judgment against the bank; the issue is the proper amount of the judgment.  1) The appeal is allowed because the respondent was the controlling authority in this case. It is instructive to determine how the proceeds of the sale be applied against the mortgage balance, and b) what is the correct amount of deficiency judgment. 2) The respondent was correct in its previous decision that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions. It was not followed that the proceeds from the judicial sale must be distributed pro rata between the purchase, non, and purchase money balances. The court considered the principles set out by the Chambers judge in Andrew. This amount was calculated as follows: The portion of the loan attributable to purchase of the land was 64.03% ($93,700.48). The remaining $87,711.00 (approximately 19.03%) represented purchase money debt. The purchase money portion of this amount was $536k. At the time of the Chambers hearing, the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sales proceeds were paid to the applicant.

She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties.

The applicant concedes the respondent is a good mother and there is nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order.

There was no evidence the applicant raised an objection to the move and indeed his affidavit suggests he did so. 4)The threshold criteria are satisfied. It is clear from the material that the child became aware in early June of the respondent's intention to move to British Columbia.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case. Dismissing the stated case application, that the questions submitted are hypothetical and speculative. They are therefore inappropriate questions for a stated case, which requires that questions must be responsive to the facts and must not be speculative.","This was an appeal from the Court of Appeal dismissing the application. Allowing the application, that the questions submitted by the applicant were predicated on a determination as yet unmade and were not responsive to the evidence or to any determination made to date in the case and, indeed, by their very wording were speculative and hypothetical.","The Workers' Compensation Board applied, by way of stated case, to have the Court answer questions with respect to the interpretation of certain provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract. The defendant counterclaimed for damages arising out of losses suffered by the defendant/plaintiff by its unjustified termination of the contract without prior notice. HELD: The contract was awarded and continued until March 11, 1986. The plaintiff brought this action. The court found that in an earlier invitation for tender issued in 1985 there was a different wording in respect to the terms and conditions in the contract, submitting that the contract was cancelled by either party following written notice or by mutual agreement by both parties.","The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals.

There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The Mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. The Mother was concerned that the Father would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for their daughter and remove her permanently from Nova Scotia. HELD: The Father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. 1)The Father was not to be under the influence of any non-prescription drug 12 hours before and while he had the child in his care. 2)Because of the father's family ties in Egypt and Kuwait, the mother was concerned he could obtain a passport for the child without her knowledge. These deficiencies did not suggest he was prepared to take the child away from her immediate past. 3)The father's access was to be twice a week for a period of two weeks, the date and time to be reflected in the order based upon the agreement of the parties.","The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child.

The trial judge found no negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to 5 months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentations and also the notice period for the wrongful dismissal, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the respondent's failure to mitigate her loss.
