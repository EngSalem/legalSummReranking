3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T. Equipment Ltd. applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant company and its creditor accepted that the terms of the indemnity set out in the proposal with respect to present and past officers and directors was too widely cast and inappropriate. At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. The February meeting of the Trustees was adjourned to allow certain questions raised by the creditors to be further investigated and to permit examination. At that meeting of 151 employees, 12 voted in favor of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed it. HELD: The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposed proposal was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and s.50(2) of the Act. Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded that the proposal presented by W.R.'T. did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Board of Investigation determined that the unfunded pension liabilities constituted trust funds pursuant to provincial pensions legislation (s.43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act), 1992 and the unsecured creditors were entitled to preferred or secured creditor status and this should be recognized in the Proposal. The Trustee received 15 employees in the same position as the applicant company. The trustee also participated in a trustee hearing on behalf of a former 28-year employee. The trustee was appointed by the Company to act as trustee of the proposal and submitted the proposal to the Board of Trustees for approval. The purpose of the trustee was to represent the general body of creditors. The court reviewed the applicant's objections and submitted its own proposal which did not stand a chance of being heard by the Board. The proposed amendment was not supported by the applicant Company's specific objections and the court was of the view that the applicants had raised legal and legal issues outside the meaning of the BIA which supported their position that the pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than those who had been classified as creditors pursuant to the previous BIA and that indemnification of past directors and officers and past directors proposed by the termsof the proposal was inappropriately wide. The trustees reached the same apparent conclusion that 89 percent of all creditors reached in voting in favour."

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence.

c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once a forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. HELD: The definition of'manufacture' in the Forest Resource Management Act is extremely broad as it says 'any step taken'. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process described in P1 encompassing the substantial amount of logging that was done within the meaning of the Act. It is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the company that included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the loghome market. The Process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence. The nature of the business as a log home is fundamentally different from that of a mill or logging facility."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for information on the activities of the Department of Justice, the RCMP, and the Fairness and Security Enforcement Bureau (OSSAB) in connection with an investigation into alleged institutional abuse. The OSSAB had been delegated the powers granted to and duties vested in the Minister of Justice pursuant to s.44 of the Act. TheOSSAB had since been reconvened and expanded to include the functions of the OLAB and the Validation Investigation Unit (VIU). The VIU and theOSSAB now cooperate with the Nova Scotia Department of Community Services in an effort to investigate and to facilitate the identification and disclosure of all of the information requested. In this capacity, the ADR process becomes a'summary process driven by the applicants/complainants'. In some cases, the allegations are completely and totally false. In others, there are indicators of the abuse, such as the type of abuse, the frequency, the amount of abuse and the extent of the harm. The process is designed to avoid conflict between the authorities and the applicants. However, in some cases the authorities have chosen to minimize the impact on the claimants by permitting the disclosure of important information about the investigation and the administration of justice, rather than allowing it to be taken for granted. In other instances, the information sought could be used to assist in the investigation of claims for compensation. The extent to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of justice had meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the respondent and in para.10 of the same affidavit. The respondent was also aware of the Stratton report and the findings of that inquiry. The resulting conflict arose as a result of the undertakings of confidentiality originally extended as compared to the amended undertakings extended by the DOJ."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","Six witnesses testified for the landlord. The landlord sold the building to the tenant at the time of the lease, retaining the exclusive use of a portion of the basement under the lease. The tenant alleged the landlord breached the lease by failing to repair the roof and by failing not to take other remedial measures to prevent water from infiltrating the building, resulting in losses to tenant's restaurant operating in the building and economic interference alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of the restaurant. HELD: The tenant was awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] for the alleged negligence by the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor.  1) The tenant is responsible for $4,800 in arrears pursuant to the lease for which the landlord is responsible. 2) The evidence does show that a part, but only a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant. 3) The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the hotel, causing a reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. The installer of the floor in 2001 was of the view that water in the basement could cause the problem with the tiles but did not test for moisture or humidity levels in the buildings material, nor did he test the sub floor. 4) There was no evidence of tortious interference by the landlord, as the tenant was not liable for any of the damages."

The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued.

The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined.  2) The Applicant seeks a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges on the grounds that whatever occurred while he was picketing Planned Parenthood amounts to professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.  3) The SAPLN takes the position that this Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy available.

HELD: On a review of all material filed, the Court concluded that it was not possible to resolve the matter summarily. The Court directed a trial of the issues between the parties.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 divorce judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children. The wife had moved out of the province and was working full time. An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month. This agreement was further reduced in 1993 to $350 per month which amount was paid from August 1989 up to 1993. The husband became unemployed in 1993, having accepted severance payments from his employment. He was to maintain all medical, dental, drug and other health benefit plans currently available through his employment with General Motors of Canada Limited or available through the children's school for so long as they are entitled to his support. An Agreement was Reached in 1989 which reduced the maintenance by $1k to $300 per month and further increased the monthly maintenance in 1994 to $570 which was increased in 1994.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the plaintiffs claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the farmers on contingency basis to prepare their reports. The plaintiffs became more and more concerned about how it would be paid and the outcome of the action. One of the farmers paid a deposit to the defendant for a remittance to the plaintiff as down payment on the latter's fees; the defendant agreed to defer payment of the plaintiff's fees until the successful conclusion of the litigation with SCIC. The respondent argued this was not a proper case for summary judgment under either the General Rules (QBR) or Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure) because the portions of the affidavit were not evidence but rather hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect in the affidavit puts the question beyond doubt. HELD: 1) The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of plaintiff's account regardless of the outcomes of their mutual client's actions. The fact that the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for a resolution of the matter of the applicant's account is beside the point. 2) The defendant agreed with the plaintiff that he would defer payment from the parties until the completion of their litigation with the SCIC, provided he received interest on the amount outstanding at a rate of 12% per annum. 3) The statements of account were all directed to the respondent without objection.  His inquiry of March 12, 1997 makes it clear also that the lawyer giving the undertaking was hoping to have a full-fledged trial for that purpose.  4) The portions of an affidavit dealing with the claim and interest as provided for in the agreement were not hearsay or opinion. If more were needed, one need only note that the statements of the parties were not attached to the affidavit. 5) The Court was very disappointed with the trial judge's decision. He was assuming that the canons of the Law Society would have sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the canon staff of the Society."

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the Judicial Centre to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The defendants sought to insure the mortgage with CMAH through its mortgage insurance program. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex. The plaintiff defended the action on various grounds and counterclaimed against the defendant for negligence in approving the calculations of Christmas. The defendant was ordered to complete all of the calculations by December 21, 2001. At issue was whether the plaintiff waived its right to rely upon the advice of a solicitor in the course of making the application for the documents. HELD: The plaintiff was granted leave to produce the documents sought. The court found that the waiver of solicitor and client privilege was reasonably inferred. There were no exceptional circumstances which would justify granting the necessary leave. The applicant had clearly indicated that he or she wished to avoid any further reliance on the defendant. The documents sought appeared to have at best tenuous relevance. While a fishing trip in Nova Scotia is permitted in certain circumstances, the purpose of taking the applicant on a boat trip is not. The discovery proceeded without objection. The applicants' claim that the banks induced them to make inaccurate representations about the cost of the project was not supported by the plaintiff's assertion that they were negligent. The admission that the applicants knew of the privilege and that it was expressly addressed prior to the discovery and in the absence of any objection, they did not raise a barrier of solicitor-client privilege."
b_2012skca3.txt,"The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen's Bench for appropriate disposition or to address further aspects of this application. [2] Turning to the merits, we note that the principal question is whether the imputed allegations in the statements of defence & counterclaim meet the requirements of Rules 173 and 149 of the Queen'sBench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. But without at least giving the applicant the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations cannot fairly be struck out as not answering to the requirement of Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps."

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The application is granted. The matter is directed to the Court of Appeal. 1) There are some distinguishing features. The original transaction between the School Division and the Flads was not concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. 2) The Flads have been in occupation of proposed parcel G, using the property as a residence and constructing corrals for use in their livestock operation. In addition to their lack of title, they failed to obtain development permits before making improvements to the site. 3) The application to lapse the caveat is dismissed pending the outcome of the Third Party Actions trial. 4) The applicant School Division is entitled to its costs of preparing the consent order. 5) The School Division has the option of applying for a subdivision approval pursuant to the Planning & Development Act. 6) In the event that the Court is unable to direct the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, resolution of the matter could be achieved in the circumstances of this case."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

(2nd Supp.) and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by the respondent for some of the child's extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education. The parties were unable to settle the sharing of the children's educational expenses for 2008/2009. HELD: The application for child support was granted. The respondent was ordered to pay $4,452.00 in full and complete satisfaction of any claim for retroactive child support for 2008-2009. The court ordered the amount paid by the applicant to be matched by the petitioner towards the applicant's expenses. 1) The respondent must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The Court held that an application of clause 3(2)(b) having regard to the actual means and needs of the respondent and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to her support be considered. 2) The applicant's total annual income for 2008 was $36,518.00. The amount ordered by the Chambers judge was $1,350.00 and the amount awarded to the respondent. The Chambers judge declined to look beyond the provisions of clause3(2) which is engaged by clause 3.2(a). The principles of the Act are rebuttable, having regard for the actual needs of each child and respective means of the parents. The test in Hagen v. Maki 2005 SKQB 393 is to determine the amount of child support payable by the father in accordance with the principles of s. 3(1)(b). The test is whether the child is a child of the marriage, whether the marriage was broken down, whether there was an ongoing economic dependence on the respondent, and whether the adult child has the means and means to contribute. The burden is on the applicant, who must take on greater responsibility if she did not learn to live with her own financial resources. 3) The Court ordered costs ordered by Pritchard. He ordered the sum of $3,452 to be paid by Ms. Nygren towards her expenses. The Chamber judge deposed that he should match the amount given by the appellant towards her costs. He also ordered that the amount be divided equally. The two parties were to pay the sum in full or partial satisfaction of the claim for the 2008-"

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, was killed when her car was struck from behind by an uninsured motorist. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the driver. Since the driver was an insured person at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any damages herself. The Court found that such a claim was not the result.

In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 Charter rights by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The accused argued that the police were acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when they forcibly entered the home in response to a disconnected 911 call. He also argued that there were other circumstances which might support a violation of s.(24) of the Charter, such as the fact that the accused's wife was sobbing and he had not answered the door. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; conviction quashed; the police's authority to enter the premises and search without a search warrant breached s.(28) The police entered the residence after receiving a distress call from the alleged victim. They entered each room and space that could hold person to ensure that no one was concealed there and that they should find and see the accused in case she required protection or rescue. Although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search the premises, to search for the accused and to go to his home. However, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of the home, all without a license. The police detained the accused, her friend, her family member and a person who was to pick her up outside the home. Once inside the house, the accused was found guilty of several drug offences. The search of each room, space and home was an attempt to determine whether there were controlled substances or precursors at the residence. The trial judge concluded that the search was justified, that the call which triggered the police response was not made by an alleged victim, or from his home, and that the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). The evidence found in each room was a mixture of hearsay and documentary evidence, and although the call to which the police responded was a 'distress' call, the call had not been made by the alleged victims or from the home of the accused."

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. 2) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not an adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary. The decisions must be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles. 3) The notice to the landlord must contain sufficient particulars of the landlord’s claim so as to enable the tenant to prepare full and proper defence. The Hearing officer, in rejecting this “boyfriend’ related evidence” when neither it nor the tenant’ s complaint contained Notice of it breached the Rules of procedural fairness and natural justice. 4) The tenant could not have had notice of the nature and extent of the disturbance and damage allegations made related to her boyfriend nor would she have had any or adequate opportunity to respond to those allegations."

To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant is entitled to rely on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against it. It must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of the allegations contained in the pleading. 2) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant (i) who cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 3) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the insurer's duty to defend. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive a narrow interpretation. 4) The application is only valid where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt as to the claim's true nature. 5) The liability is only set out by the pleading and the determination of the true nature of the claims. The liability lies with the insurer, not with the defendant. 6) The defendant has the right to make all reasonable and complete claims, to minimize the damage to the plaintiff and to ensure that his or her claim is not adversely affected. 7) There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant breached its obligations under the contract. 8) The defendants were negligent and breached their contractual and other duties owed by them to Genex. Genex entered into a contract with the plaintiff to build the Tullymet Nucleus Unit. The defendant subcontracted the plaintiff's construction company to do the work for the construction project. The general contractor was the general contractor and it was responsible to furnish all materials, plant and labour necessary for the proper completion of the entire construction of the unit. The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the costs of the construction contract. 9) Genex was awarded general damages of $2,000.00.

At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The respondent sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the respondent to move from the matrononial home as it was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the respondent having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. HELD: The respondent was granted exclusive possession. 1)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules (1) and (4) of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","HELD: The court found that the respondent was in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007. The court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor and client costs of $15,000. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and remained in contempt until the court ordered him to pay the solicitor and disposal costs of the offending equipment. Costs of the contempt application were set at $15k. The applicant did not appeal the order nor did he appeal it. Given his continued failure to comply, the court asked the court to impose a significant fine or penalty. The defendant applied to have the contempt proceedings adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date after December 15, 2014 that the court was available to the court. The Court found that this was not a case of the respondent being in contempt because he had not followed the proper procedures and had failed to provide the court with the appropriate sanction. Corrupt proceedings are not for punishment per se but for upholding the rule of law and respect for court orders. In this case, the respondent has provided no reasonable excuse for his initial failure to compliance with the court order or for his repeated failures to complete the purging of his contempt despite being given many opportunities to do so. The evidence established that most of the equipment was located near pipeline running under the respondent's land and that the farmer had taken steps to improve his land, which allowed him to move it as a storage yard. Significant additional costs may be incurred by the respondent and added to the tax rolls for Parcel A and became payable by Schmidt if he does not purge his contempt within the time allotted by the court and before the RM moves to remove the equipment from Parcel B.

The wife was working and living in the same apartment as the petitioner. She required a special diet and special diet, and was also required to take medication. The court found that the respondent was entitled to spousal support and that it would be unfair and unconscionable to separate matrimonial assets acquired by one party prior to marriage from those acquired by the parties. The pension was not divided but was divided in trust and was held in trust with the trustee. The trustee was awarded an additional $1,600 per month as spousals and disbursements under s. 13 of the Matrimonial Property Act. Although the petitioner's pension entitlement was established at $384,556.18 for the entire period between the separation and the date of the divorce, it was not renewed for another three years as it was missing important terms. The judge was not required to determine precisely what the parties owed each other. The evidence was that the trustee had no legal obligation to repay the debt and that the petitioner had no moral obligation to do so."

The court distinguished between punitive and aggravated damages and noted that the defendants' breach of contract did not have to be 'wanton or reckless' for the plaintiffs' claim in mental distress to succeed.

The defendant successfully applied for summary judgment.

The plaintiffs suffered significant loss of income, pension, and savings, as well as significant stress and anguish resulting from the failed real estate transactions.

The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of attempted murder, assault with a weapon, breach of undertaking and possession of a weapon while on remand. At his sentencing hearing, the Crown called expert evidence about street gangs and gang activity in the prison. The defence called Father Andre Poilievre, volunteer who worked with inmates at the prison where the accused was serving time for a break and enter. The RCMP were called to assist with the assessment of risk. The evidence was conclusive that the accused had failed to restrain his behaviour in the past. HELD: The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code. 1) Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious injury offence. 2) The Court found the accused should be found dangerous offender within the Meaning of s753(1)(a)(i) and he should be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. 3) The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a serious offender designation and the long-term offender designation was appropriate. The Court held that the offences committed were substantially or pathologically intractable."

Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt in two reefer trailers.

The 15 day period begins to run from the date the prospective buyer obtained possession of goods as lessee, and not from the time that the buyer became buyer of the goods. 3)A person is not in possession of collateral within s33(2) unless that person is a debtor as defined, unless the collateral is a collateral as defined by the P.P.S.A. and unless another person 'obtained' physical possession of those collateral at the requested of the debtor. 4)The application was denied. It is ordered that its purchase-money security interests were first in the possession of Gj Bell as vendor and then in possession by Mid- Canada as installer. 5)It seems reasonably clear that 'naked possession' is not enough to start the fifteen-day period running. The buyer is not necessarily to be construed adebtor the instant delivery is made. Mere physical control does not necessarily constitute 'possession' under s34. The fifteen days within which the purchase money security interests must be perfected has priority to a debtor as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code s22. 6)Costs from the respondent were awarded to the applicant in accordance with the terms of the agreement."

An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files 5 years after they attained majority, and were preparing to file a statement of claim. The deceased was a matter beyond the control of the parties but one would expect there would be hospital, patient and SHSP records of treatment. There was no indication as to who took over the plaintiff's files or whether he practised with others who may have his case histories and patient records. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The plaintiff's father was found to have died in a very adverse weather condition. 2)The SGI notes produced from the SGI's conversations with the plaintiff indicated that the Lavoie firm was continuing to represent the plaintiff some 6 months after the initial consultation, and had been paying the plaintiff since the death. 3)An infant with bona fide causes is privileged suitors. So, an infant should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him in the same action. 4)The applicants' decision to destroy their files was understandable but was not based on merit. The SGI note clearly indicated the plaintiff did not believe she could do anything as a result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoyie. That very significant delay was a factor that must consider, but only one. Undoubtedly there will be some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of having destroyed their file, the death of Dr. Leakos and the diminution of memories over period of 11 years. Those factors must be weighed, however, against the interests of the plaintiff. The application is dismissed but the costs are to be reserved to the defendant."

The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court of Canada before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The police had responded to a disturbance call and found a person who was wanted by the police. When asked his name, the appellant gave a fictitious one. The officers responded to another call and were certain that the appellant was the person who had assaulted the complainant. When they returned to the location of the second call, they were also certain that he was person sought by police. The appellant argued that the warrants for the assault were for assault causing bodily harm and a warrant for property damage. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge failed to establish that the police officer was engaged in his duty at the time of the assault and had the necessary determination whether the officer had, in making the arrest, the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code. Pursuant to s686(1)(a), s. 686(2) and the Code, the accused was given his Charter rights to counsel and police warning. He also engaged in a verbal confrontation with one of the occupants of a second residence to which the police had been called. The two offences for which the warrants were issued and an offence arising out of the disturbance on LaHave Street were related. The accused took the position that the Crown had failed to prove that the officer was in the Execution of his duty, as he was arresting for an assault on the complainant and that the warrant for the property damage was a warrant that was for the same offence. The Crown appealed the conviction and sought new trial. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no misdirection by the trial court."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant, both farmers, became involved in a lawsuit regarding a sale of three quarters of land by the defendant. The defendant listed his farmland for sale on an online auction platform. He claimed the offer was made in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The plaintiff sued for specific performance and damages. Both parties agreed that the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the subject quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. The issue is whether there was any agreement respecting the sale and purchase of the land.  1) The central issue in this lawsuit is the application to the draft Statute for Frauds. The essence of the contract is the essential element of compliance between the parties. 2) The defendant and plaintiff have been in three separate phone conversations over the past 3 and a half year. The issues are the content of the calls, the format of the bidding and the manner in which the words were used and the legal characterization of these telephone conversations. 3) The parties agree that the requirement of writing under the Act is an additional essential element to the essential elements, including compliance with the statutory rules. The essential facts of the conversation, including the fact that the defendant stated he would not accept the plaintiff's offer respecting the Subject Quarters, did not mean he was not prepared to accept the bid. 4) There is no evidence of the essential information that goes into the conclusion of a contract. The relationship was not created solely through the exchange of information. The fact that there was no agreement between the defendants and their respective representatives at the bidding process in December 2014 is irrelevant in this case. The parties have been unable to establish that the plaintiff was acting in good faith and the reality of the situation is that the agreement was not in writing. The Court must determine whether the parties have established that the contractual framework was breached.  5) The plaintiff will have to establish on a case by case basis that the essential facts and the relationships between the two parties were not breached in any meaningful way.  6) The court accepts the defendant's contention that he signed the contract in the first telephone conversation (which lasted less than five minutes). The defendant will also have to prove that the parties understood the terms of the Act and that"
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. Prior to being remanded, the accused was attending a substance abuse and anger management program. The accused was on two probation orders that prohibited him from possessing firearms and was on an undertaking to keep the peace. The victim of the shooting said he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. He said he would suffer unnecessary hardship if released pending appeal because he would fall behind in his schoolwork and be unable to complete his high school education. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused's release so soon after being sentenced would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice. The Court of Appeal did not find that the appellant's release from custody pending appeal would be in the public interest as given the circumstances of the offence, his record of violent offences, and numerous breaches of court orders."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children (ages 12 and 13). The respondent applied to vary the period for which retroactive child support would apply, arguing that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The respondent argued that he received formal notice of the petitioner's claim on October 9, 2008 and the retroactive amount of support should be limited to three years prior to that date. The issues were whether the respondent was guilty of blameworthy conduct; whether the petitioner had established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his parents. HELD: 1)The respondent's application to vary was retroactive to April 2008. He did not seek any of these benefits. He established their home in April 2008 and claimed retroactive support if any will be calculated for the younger child.  2)The Court did not find jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties' older child. 3)The parties agreed that the corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and an equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. However, the Court held that it was not necessary to decide between basic table amounts and s.7 expenses. 4)The trial judge could not be blind to the prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. 5)The court was not required to decide on the merits of each party's claim for retroactivity. The parties' argument that the respondent had not received the relevant documents until October 2008 and that he must disclose the material change in circumstances to the recipient parent was speculative and conjecture. 6)The issues raised by the petitioner were retroactive review of the base table amount of monthly child support paid by the respondent and the respondent's contribution to the section 7 (special expenses) expenses for the children."

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and Maintenance Enforcement. The father continued to pay the full child and spousal support and the combined support increased to $2,000 every two weeks. The mother destroyed any cheques she received from Maintenance Enforcement in the previous amount; she claimed to have received 40-41% of the money in the amount owing. The respondent did not contest the claim. The evidence of the children leaving their mother's care and moving in with their father and being supported by their father was not reliable. There were gaps in her records and her memory was mostly speculative. She believed she received 40-$41,500 in the 2005 year. The standard variation clause is contained in the Separation Agreement and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The payments documented in 2001 were $10,000 directly to the mother. In 2002, $25,000 was deducted from the respondent's ongoing support payments. In 2004, $1,000 of the $52,000 paid by the father directly was garnisheed. The amount owing under the old agreement was $29,672. There has been no variation of this order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment dated the 24th day of April, 1996. The defendant continued to provide financial support to the parties, including support for the oldest child, who graduated from high school in 1999 and was working in the field. He acknowledged payments of $2k per month for the past two years. In 2005, the defendant ceased paying support. In January 2006, the Applicant requested enforcement of the amount in the original order and she received directly $2 million. She has not verified by her records or memory what she received in August 2005. The Court has not challenged the defendant's claim that she received $52k. The plaintiff is entitled to vary in amount of support in any event. The court has not interfered with the parties' ability to meet their obligations under the terms of the agreement.

7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.",At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. The student had been suspended from the program for five years. The university insisted that he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The College argued that creating an exception would somehow affect the integrity of the policy. HELD: There was no dispute on the facts. Both parties relied on the record developed in earlier proceedings. The Court of Queen's Bench agreed that general visitatorial jurisdiction extends not only to judging that the university satisfy standards that are fundamental to the administration of justice but also to assessing the objective reasonableness of the exercise of discretion by those persons charged with administering the internal laws and policies of the university. It is not reasonable for the College of medicine to insist on the student obtaining new third party financing before he will be permitted to resume the program.

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words in question had been posted at the Hospital and on the Union's website. The Union had been unsuccessful in obtaining an equivalent position in the United States. The plaintiff now sought employment in a position with the same stature as the Union and was forced to file this grievance when she experienced renewed personal harassment after her return to the hospital. The plaintiffs filed a statement of defence arguing that the words in the grievance were not defamed by the publication of the allegations, but rather that the plaintiff's allegations were entirely unfounded and without substance. The defendants' next argument was that the court erred in failing to find that the publications were not protected by absolute privilege. This was not supported by the fact that the statements were published in such a broad way and had the effect of degrading the plaintiff’s reputation. The trial judge correctly referred to the labour relations context and the purposes for which the communications were posted are more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation. The lawyer for the plaintiffs was quoted in the opposing side of the argument that the Union had published a grievance that was defamed and that it only awaited the final hearing to prove that such was the case. He also referenced the use of the term 'active part of the harassment himself' in his argument. The parties’ argument that there was no malice in the statements was rejected because they were both published in the context of the same publication and did not raise any reasonable doubt as to their accuracy that they were defamed, but nonetheless supported the defence of qualified privilege and the plaintiffs’ right to rely upon it."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court found that the accused was not only grossly lacking in mental abilities but also had a limited understanding of the nature of the proceedings and its possible consequences.

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, a few years later. They subsequently divorced. After their separation, the executrix of their estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The executrix successfully applied for a review of the Will and found that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the right of the testator's former spouse to renounce any inheritance under the will. The deceased, who had died intestate, requested that the estate bequeathed to the appellant a portion of the bequest of his future estate. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed; he failed to give any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounced, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, would bind a person to make a will such as this one. He did not decide the second issue before him which dealt with the distribution of the estate."

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Respondent, who was collecting the respondent's pension, died intestate on May 3, 2007. The respondent was employed by the respondent for thirty-one years. During that period, the respondent contributed to a pension plan valued following his death at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). The Respondent was separated from his wife, the biological mother of the applicants, and had been separated from one another for approximately twelve years at the time of his death. The applicant was the Respondent's spouse. The parties were in a direct conflict. The continuing payment of the survivor benefits is an immediate benefit to her, which would be lessened if it were to be paid to the Estate and divided amongst the heirs.

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward.

The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. A Provincial Court Judge convicted the defendant on the basis that he applied an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. The trial judge erred in applying the doctrine of stare decisis and in failing to apply the standard of correctness. The defendant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid the offence. The system implemented by the defendant in R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by the other defendant in this case. 2)The evidence at the trial suggested that prior to the incident, prior to Westfair having an established system to prevent its cashiers from selling tobacco to anyone under the age of 18, prior the defendant had an established one to prevent them from selling cigarettes to minors. The evidence at trial suggested the trial judge applied a standard of diligence which required the defendant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or actions that could have been taken to prevent their cashiers, including preventing the cashier from selling the cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable. 3)The defendant received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired. The policy generally states that tobacco cannot be sold to anyone over the ageof 18. If person looks as though there are under 25 years of age or if there is any doubt about the customer's age, then the customer should be required to provide identification to the clerk before they can purchase tobacco. If the customer refuses to provide an identification, the sale should be refused or the manager or supervisor should be called. This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. 4)As outlined in RFL v. W.Friesen, the principles of Due diligence and due diligence in s.813 of the Criminal Code do not mean superhuman efforts. To demand more, would move a strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The applicant company appealed its assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall, known as the Normanview Mall. The company was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed the assessment to the Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee as they did not reach the conclusion that the sale price was not in dispute. The issue was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision to include the sales of the mall in its determination of the appropriate valuation factor (MAF). HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The assessment of the shopping mall was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6 (c) and (d) of the Assessment Manual.  2) While the Committee relied heavily on the sale verification information in upholding its decision regarding the sale of the Southland Mall, they did so in reliance upon s.173 and s.172 of The Cities Act. 3) The Committee found nothing requiring them to either exclude the sale from consideration in calculating the MAF or to adjust the sale sale price beyond the adjustments he had already made. 4) The company did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. In the case of the Northgate Mall, no evidence was brought forward that would render the information provided in the verification form invalid. 5) The Court found that the Committee breached its duty to act fairly in upholding their decision. It did not accept the Committee's finding that the sales in question were in dispute and did not provide sufficient evidence to support its determination. The Court awarded the company's share of the fee simple interest in the property, assuming it acquired its interest on an arm's length sale."

HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner has chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. The terms of the proposed consent judgment were improvident. The parties appeared content to receive assets mainly in the value of their car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment also provided that the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the circumstances. The petitioner is prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support though she earns only $15,000 per year, while the respondent earns $48,000. The court must refuse the application. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal was anything but unconscionsable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently unfair the proposed judgement was to her. 2)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It was certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. They could reduce their understanding to writing, even if there is no lawyer prepared to sign certificate of independent advice for obvious reasons. 3)The court could not condone the application of legal advice or guidance on the part of the petitioner or the petitioner on her behalf nor would it permit the petitioner to request legal advice and advice from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she has thereunder. The Court could not urge the petitioner nor would she request legal guidance and advice but would strongly urge her to seek it. 4)The proposed judgment was unconscionaable in that it required guidance and guidance from the petitioner and the respondent. It could not be expected that the court would acquiesce and allow the petitioner the advice and guidance that she must seek. 5)The Court must reject the application for legal assistance and support. No reasonable person could conclude that a proposed judgment is anything but 'uncionable' or unconscioed. No legal advice, guidance or advice could be given on the application and would be strongly discouraged. The applicant could not request legal counsel or advice but could request guidance and counsel. 6)The applicant could"

As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants applied for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the union alleges the employer conducted a promotional routine for the positions of lieutenant and captain that was repeated every two years. The applicants claimed the employer had interfered in the course of the grievance by failing to provide specific time and information to the union president. Dismissing the application, that the union's position was that the notice went out effective May 10th 1991 structuring the use of the demoted lieutenant as acting lieutenans. This was based upon the ripple effect of the employer's proposal that up to fifty fire fighters would be moved within the fire department in September. This is an arguable issue that could result in the rankings of the promotional routine being changed and the rescinding of any appointments made pursuant to the 1989 captain's promotional routine. However, the number of individuals who were affected is much smaller and will be primarily the seven who are demoted who are now from time to time serving as acting liesutenants."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: 1) The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends that the trial judge properly found that there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is set out by R. v. Shepherd. The Alberta Court of Appeal decision sets out a series of 11 steps for a trial judge to follow in determining whether a detained person has suffered a violation of his or her s.'10(b). HELD: The appeal is dismissed on ground one.  1) There was insufficient evidence to support a breach of the appellant's s.10(B) Charter right. The trial Judge properly applied the standard of reviewing to the facts of the case, which is measured on appeal against the yardstick of correctness. 2) Two components must co-exist for a police officer to have reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample. The officer must subjectively have an honest belief that the suspect has committed an offence and objectively there must be reasonable grounds for that belief. The police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol on their breath but out of nervousness or other cause. There was no evidence that required no assistance to exit her vehicle, walk to and enter the police cruiser without assistance. The accused argued that the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with the Prosper warning resulted in a breach pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.  3) On the factual and legal grounds, the waiver must be free and voluntary and must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. 4) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. The test of credibility can only be assessed with great deference. The facts as found by the officer should not be disturbed."

b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' which would have allowed charges to be laid in both provinces but for a'special plea' of 'de facto' acquit. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was a loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of jurisdiance over the accused and not the offence. The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case.  2)The charges were deemed to be dismissed as a result of a summons issued in Alberta before May 7, 2001 but were adjourned for hearing. 3)The Saskatchewan court had not lost jurisdiction over the person lost in Alberta and could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s.487(1 of the Code. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan. 4)The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for wantof prosecution in Alberta. 5)The informations sworn on March 1, 2001, and March 29, 2001 in this proceeding were stayed. 6)The Crown appealed. 7)The court was unable to agree that a Saskatchewan court as a consequence of a provincial court summons issued before May 8, 2001 revived jurisdiction over it in Alberta until the matter was recommenced. 8)Section 485.1 permits the charges be recommenced and the special plea is dismissed for an abuse of process. 9)The Court was not awarded costs in any event. 10)The appeal against the acquit was dismissed for abuse of due process. 11)The principles of common law and the regime set up in the criminal Code which provides jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or when committed within 500 metres of any province."

The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving that arrangement pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act. The plan proposed liquidation and dissolution with provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch opposed approval of the arrangement on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. HELD: The Court found no conflict between the power given to the court in s. 185(l) and s. 220(1) of the SBCA regarding the distribution of capital and that the Court could exercise its power under s. 210(l)(i) while comply with the mandatory direction in s.(220(1)). The purpose of the legislation was to allow the court to approve a proposed distribution to shareholders of their entitlement, qua shareholders, either in the form of money or the division of property or assets of the Corporation. The Court could order that rather than the real estate being liquidated, it be divided among the shareholders in a specie proportionate to their entitlement as shareholders. 1) The Court had no difficulty in finding that the phrase 'disposition of any property belonging to creditors or shareholders who cannot cannot find' was used by the appellant for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The application was dismissed with no problems.  2) The application for an order directing the Court to approve the proposed distribution did not engage the arguments and issues that were in play in the present situation. Rather, the Court had to rely on the generality of the provisions in the Act. 3) The appellant's proposed arrangement did not have to be perfect in that it did not involve any elements of change of control or of shareholders being required to exchange one type of shares for other assets or any arrangement that facilitated an ongoing existence of the company. The appellant argued that the business purpose for the arrangement was to assist in relieving the Shareholders against the losses suffered by them and to provide Missing Shareholders with a reasonable opportunity to identify themselves and to obtain return of their respective original investments. 4) The court found no problems with the wording used in the appellant's submissions. 5) There was no evidence that the appellant was trying to circumvent the statutory requirements for a liquidation or dissolution of a corporation by proposing an arrangement that would allow the Court"
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. The report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff must prove his claim on a balance of probabilities. 1) The plaintiff was not satisfied on a balanced of probabilities that the offending substances got into the lawn or killed it. 2) There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause. 3) The defendant had access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. His evidence is that it is unlikely that glyphosate or Ally killed the lawn but that soil sterilant was probably to blame."
c_1995canlii5774.txt,"The parties applied to the Court to resolve the issues of spousal support and a division of the matrimonial property. The parties had been married 4 years. There were no children of the marriage. The Wife had a university education but was unemployed. She had already received interim support in the amount of $1,500.00 per month for 1 year. HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","The parties were unable to resolve three issues stemming from the breakdown of their 4 1/2 year marriage: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of the property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: The husband's obligation should end on November 30, 1995 and the balance of payments should be ordered for another year. 1)The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. 2)The wife's health was fragile and it was illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them. 3)The husband was entitled to an exemption for the amount owing to him pursuant to s23 of the Matrimonial Property Act."

This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving while impaired by alcohol or drug. The Provincial Court Judge had reserved his decision and then found him guilty. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Justice dismissed the appeal. The appellant sought leave to appeal and appealed the conviction. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not err in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form.

b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal from 1992 CanLII 7943 (SK QB), [1992] 6 W.W.R. 116) must be dismissed. There is some confusion as to the answers he gave to the questions posed in his judgment. In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to whether to associate."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court by way of transfer from Youth Court.A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court which was not yet transferred from Youth court. The facts were that the complainant was not as credible as the accused, having been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each had spent considerable time in jail. HELD: The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment. 1)Any of the alleged sexual assaults occurred between the ages of 9 and 11 when the amendment was made to the Young Offenders Act did not conform to the significance of those dates nor did his testimony leave any reasonable doubt he forced sexual intercourse with the complainant in the fashion she described and that he touched her on one or two subsequent occasions. There was however no convincing evidence that any of the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on the date he became an Adult. 2)Any dates between 11 and 11 years were properly specified. 3)The accused was charged with sexually assaulting the complainant when she was 11 and was almost 11 on the first date."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a Swift Current police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The police observed the trailer and noticed that it was overweight. The officer stopped the vehicle and found that the trailer was being operated by the accused. The RCMP had erected road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. The roadside signs were located along various grid roads in the area. HELD: 1)It is mandatory for the minister to give notice of an order issued pursuant to s35. There is no evidence to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to be given. The notice was given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods. 2)There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily. There was no notice in any other media. 3)The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in their municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. It is not the municipality's responsibility to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the minister by publishing the order. 4)No other notice to the general public was given."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a child protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. The child was apprehended at birth and is the subject of a Child Protection Hearing. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act.  1)The Act does not authorize the the public trustee to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of H. B. However that becomes more evident when s.32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult (PTSD). Nowhere does the Act authorize the a public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act. 2)The public trustee best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v. Magiera. Besides, no one else has come forward to fulfill that role. 3)The Public Trustees in this province have acted in a number of child protection cases to protect the interests of a mentally deficient parent who is unable to act on his/her own behalf. It would appear that in each case the Public trustee consented to act and as result was appointed by the court to act in the case of her son. If the court failed to intervene, the child will be left in limbo, a victim of the system. 4)An order for costs was issued."

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation.

e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to the treatment he might give. The doctor prepared a medical report for the hospital in response to a written request by the police. The appellant had not been advised by the doctors that he was intoxicated at the time of the accident. When the hospital staff arrived at the hospital, the appellant had taken a blood sample of him for medical purposes while the accused was unconscious, contrary to an explicit refusal by the appellant to provide a sample under any circumstances. In the present case, the police officer acting upon the information provided to him by the doctor did not breach the defendant's s.8 Charter right."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Ministry did not show that it had taken measurable steps to deal with the father’s anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children were exposed to violence on the night of July 7, 2013. There was no adult person able or willing to provide for their needs and physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the children. As a result, the children were in need of protection. The Ministry determined to pursue a permanent wardhip order on April 8, 2014.  1) The evidence disclosed that the father had taken no measurable steps on his anger and violence issues. He had abstained from alcohol and was intoxicated at the time of the offence. The evidence showed the children struggle on an ongoing basis from the trauma they experienced at the hands of their father. The options in s. 37(1) are premised upon a realistic prospect of change, within reasonable time and reasonable use of resources if needed. 2) There were two children involved in this matter: J.G., born …, 2001 and H.G. born …. 2003. Their parents were both in the temporary custody of the Minister and the children had been in the foster care system for several years. The father had been absent from the children’re lives for the past three years. Their emotional and psychological state required them to continue to be in needof protection. 3) The children had not been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose. The mother was engaged in serious matters which preclude the attention to children. Neither parent was available to care for these children."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference.

c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under the terms of the order of the Court of Appeal. HELD: 1) The delay from the period of May 2010 to May 2012 is an inexcusable delay of 1 year. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not such as to lead the Court on its own to strike the claim. 2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is that of a one-year period that it took the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertakings. This would not lead the court to strike. 3) The application to strike is made using the principles set out in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson. 4) The Court found that for the initial period May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. For the period between May 2010 and May 2012 the delay is almost entirely attributable to the defendant's undertakings not responding in a timely fashion to the plaintiff. The defendant has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed. This is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is unlikely that the Court will strike."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law as witness. The Crown called two disinterested witnesses, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club and another fan who was seated at the rear of the seats cheering loudly. The witnesses testified that the accused was standing on the walkway at the front of the bleachers when the collision occurred. The second disinterested witness testified that he saw the accused run away from the stage after the victim stopped his car and punched him in the face. HELD: The accused was convicted. The Court held that the Crown has an obligation to prove that the bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 1) The Court of Appeal expressly did not follow R.v. Nurse (1993), 83 C.C.C.(3d) 546, the decision of the Ontario Court of Court which held the elements of assault causing harm consist of: (1) the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim; (2) that such force resulted in bodily harm; (3) the assault is a contributing cause of the injury, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause; and (4) the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The court found that the trial judge could properly find that the causation factor had been proved."
b_1994canlii4708.txt,FIAT An application was taken under s.180(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act to set aside a bankrupt's discharge on the basis that it was obtained by fraud. A Queen's Bench Chambers Judge dismissed the application. This decision was appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's determination.,"Fulltext of judgment follows: The appeal, insofar as it is based on s. 180(2) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act may or may not apply to the judgment held by the appellants, we wish to make it clear that we have made no finding in that respect."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. HELD: 1) The Provincial Court judge ruled that the usual Rules of Evidence pertaining to Criminal trials did apply and had held that hearsays evidence was not admissible. 2) The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. 3) The court reviewed the decision in R. v. Lifchus, 2012 SKQB 16 (CanLII), 369 Sask.R. 277 (Q.C.C.) and found that the normal criminal rules of law apply to this type of hearing. The court also found that there was a reduced standard of admissibility based on the fact that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. 4) The Court held that the ordinary criminal rules, which apply in criminal trials, did not apply in this case. 5) It was not intended that the judge strictly apply the rules of the evidence. 6) The normal criminal rule of evidence applied to s810 hearings. 7) Hearsay evidence is admissible in evidence. 8) In this case the court was not satisfied that s.810.1 did not create criminal offence but rather it seeks to prevent the commission of a criminal offence. It is preventative rather than punitive. The usual rules to be applied in criminal proceedings do not apply. Hearsays evidence is not admissible. 7). The Crown sought to have records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) be inadmissible as business records under s.30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 8. The Court was also satisfied that the transcript of a telephone conversation between a person who was not a party to the hearing and the person who answered the telephone conversation was credible and trustworthy. 9) The accused submits that these are errors in law in that they are only admissible at a general trial. 10) The usual conduct of evidence in a criminal trial is to be used to determine the burden of proof. 11) The standard of review is correctness on a question of law basis. 12) The principles of review are correctness on question of evidence."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that cross-examination by the Crown was improper and that the trial judge failed to find that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision. Appeal dismissed; the appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the accident and its aftermath was prejudicial, and the admission of that part of the record was more prejudicial than probative. The question of where the occupants of the truck were seated was not raised during cross- examination but was raised during the appellant’s examination-in-chief. The issue was whether the appellant or the driver of the vehicle were the ones who were involved in the collision and whether this collision caused the loss of life or caused the appellant to have an alcohol problem. The only conclusion drawn from the evidence was that both the appellant and the driver were seated in the truck and that their position in the vehicle did not change significantly from the time the collision occurred. Although Crown counsel indicated that it would not put these questions to the defence, no objection was raised by the defence. At no time did the defence make an application to exclude portions of his record on the basis of the Corbett decision, on the grounds their admission was more than prejudicial."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of an dangerous offender. He also conceded that the trial judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter to the court stating that he was doing a life sentence for the two sexual assaults. He then followed this letter to this Court where he said that he did not sexually assault anyone and was falsely accused by the victims who were forced to lie by the police. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The defendant was found not guilty of all of the offences. The court was not bound to accept the assessment of these experts. The judge instructed himself properly on the law and noted the appropriate authorities in order to decide the contested issue. The third point in s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code is the least restrictive means by which to reduce the public threat posed by the offender to an acceptable level. The Court emphasized that the first step to successful treatment is the acceptance of responsibility. Both experts acknowledged that the process of assessing a person's character and behaviour was complex and it was important to have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities in the criminal justice system. The trial judge was also required to give specific reasons for questioning the foundation the assessments were based upon. 2) While the defendant displayed good behaviour for short periods of time, for the most part the evidence from correctional staff points to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour. The opinions of the experts were premised upon two assumptions. The first being that the accused was well-behaved in the prison, but that he had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women. The second was that the young defendant was capable of being rehabilitative and that he would be able to return to the community if he had completed high intensity sexual offender treatment. The fact that the youth defendant was unable to resist the temptation to use drugs and alcohol did not disqualify him from participating. The youth defendant's rehabilitation was ongoing and there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community through the imposition of a long term sentence."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and ordered to return to the wife certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off her social assistance disability benefits and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold, claiming a reversible error in two respects: first, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and secondly, that the Chambers judge was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the husband's behaviour. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis. 1) The husband's application was dismissed with costs. 2) There was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. 3) The wife's application for a separation of matrimonious assets was dismissed. The Chambers judge had ordered the sale of the home without knowing the value of the equity remaining in it. He ordered that all matrimony assets be divided equally after the payment of legal fees and real estate commission. 4) The mother's application requesting a divorce settlement was granted. The judge ordered the purchase of a house with the proceeds to be paid off within two years. 5) The matrimonian wife's request for a division of assets was denied. The chambers judge ordered that title to the house and the mortgage be sold without delay or impediment. He also ordered that the wife's obligations to pay spousal support and the increased mortgage were to continue until the earlier of either the sale or the day after the June mortgage payment is due. 6) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,500 in spousals and $800 in mortgage payments. 7) The court reviewed the record and submissions of counsel. They were all very credible and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it. Otherwise the matter could be directed to any other member of the Court."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.C-8.2 as am. and The Children's Law Act,1997, SS.1997 as am have been issued pursuant to The Children’s Law Act and The Family Security Act, 2002. The child was to pay ongoing support of $300.00 per month in the first two months of 2006. During the balance of 2006 and 2007 the arreears increased. The $1,300 in arrear was not significant issue in the circumstances. A delay in enforcement of the arreaars would cause hardship to the payor; and 1) Arrearns have accumulated. The payor agreed to pay $300 non-taxable in 1992. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The Court was cognizant of the fact the petitioner’d been paying at a rate that is greater than his legal obligation in 1992 and in 1992 the agreed to paying $300 in monthly non- taxedable arrerears had accumulated and he was paying less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. Arreears have accrued and the respondent was paying in excess of his legal obligations. 2) There is money sitting in the Maintenance Enforcement Office as a result of federal intercept. The Maintenance Enforcement office is holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. 3) The petitioner was actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further the Court was not prepared to impute an explanation of the ongoing financial needs of the petitioner. Any delay in enforcing arreared payments would cause a hardship to him and he could in fact work full time and earn an income of approximately $40,000 and"
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped behind a police officer as he was approaching a controlled intersection. The officer locked in his vehicle at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour in a sixty kilometre zone and the accused accelerated substantially prior to the officer activating the emergency equipment. At the controlled intersection, there was no one else in the vehicle but the officer's vehicle. There was one other vehicle beside the accused which was left behind when the accused's vehicle stopped. The police officer noted heavy traffic on the roadway and the sound of sirens. The driver of the Mustang was seen accelerating for two to three blocks at a rate of over one hundred km an hour. The posted speed limit in this area is 60 km/h. The evidence was not in dispute. The vehicle was still accelerating and travelling greater than the speed limit. However, at this point the officer locked the vehicle speed at one million and forty-five kilometres anhour. There were no other vehicles in the area. The highway was fairly open and fairly open. There wasn't any traffic jam or traffic light interference. The only conclusion that the court could draw was that the driving action was planned and deliberate. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62 of The Labour Standards Act. 2) There is no evidence before the Court that an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board or an appeal to the Queen’s Bench is a true appeal. 3) The applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to set aside the certificate. 4) There are two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 6) The court is not without jurisdiction to grant an extension of time to appeal. The principles and considerations that apply to director appeals are analogous to those in cases where a plaintiff obtains a default judgment and seeks to set up a noting for default. Essentially, an unsworn allegation is made and the employer has 21 days to file a dispute, failing which the allegation is considered to be admitted. 7) The applicants either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of his patients. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling in favour of the Government using a particular billing code. The Government cross-appealed in relation only to the limited aspect of the case in which DrHuerto enjoyed success at trial. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the Protocol and the MCIB's related use of the AU code are not inconsistent with the payment schedule. The principles set out in the Protocol are not the same as those of the MCIA. 2) In order to properly assess its merit, it would be appropriate to read the Schedule as simultaneously denying the Government the right to make inquiries necessary to determine whether such reductions should be made.  3) The payment schedule is best characterized as an individualized administrative process with respect to the payment of physician services provided by physician. A large number of the claims are barred because they were not submitted within 6 months of the date the services were provided. However, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so, rendered this aspect of his claim premature.  4) The Protocol is not an Individualized Administrative Process. It is not a Joint Medical Professional Review Committee established pursuant to s. 49.2 of the Health Canada Act. The Court of Appeal concluded that both the Appeal and the Cross-Appeal were not inconsistent. 5) The physician chose to not respond to requests for additional information, which was a practical consequence of that decision. As a consequence, he received no payment for the services in issue. The claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. 6) The defendant was awarded damages in the amount of 30 percent of the billings for 16 patients for whom whom he had submitted additional information in April 1996. 7) The costs of the appeal were reduced by 30 percent as a result of the difficulty in processing the accounts. 8) Costs of the Cross Appeal were awarded in the amounts of 30% of the accounts payable. 9) The court awarded costs in the range of $1,000 to the plaintiff. 10) The claim against the respondent was awarded against costs of $2,000.

4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff applied for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. Application allowed; judgment entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed. Although there was an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument, there was no 'air to reality' to it. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to his affidavit, one finds there are numerous other factors affecting the plaintiff's health. Judgement is entered against both parties. It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. The Court must be cautious in assessing likely recovery of the plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is a lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary. The case law may be summarized as follows: 1)A summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is an arguable issue to be tried, namely, that even if one accepts the evidence of the Plaintiff, one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence. 2)If the plaintiffs injuries were not minor in nature, they could not be overcome by the addition of some new information. 3)The Plaintiff's affidavit evidence was of a similar nature to the one submitted by the defendants. There was no air of reality to her argument. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of her's car. The traffic light turned red. To strike the plaintiff’s vehicle from behind on these facts would strike the defendant too close or didn’t have enough care or control of his vehicle. Consequently the collision occurred."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. The wife had been working part-time as a daycareer and the parties' home was far from complete. She moved with the children to live with their father when they were not attending university. The parties' eldest child, who was fifteen years old at the time of the marriage, lived with his mother when he was working as a taxi driver. They separated in October 2004 and have not resumed cohabitation since that date. There is no possibility of reconciliation. The court ordered custody to the parties. The husband was employed with the federal government. He also maintained a truck driver's license and drove a cab on a part-timing basis. The petitioner was employed as a social worker. She earned two university degrees and now a career as a Social Worker. The children's living arrangements were disrupted by the husband's increasingly demanding work schedule. They were unable to find a suitable apartment and lived with their mother when she was not working. The respondent's wife was unable to obtain a suitable one. They had moved with their two children to a new home which was approximately a half-hour walk from the petitioner's apartment. The two older children moved with her. The Court ordered custody of the children and ordered access to the mother. The mother was to apply for interim access. The father was to pay child support and child support. The child's mother was not to be inconvenienced. The evidence showed that the parties had difficulty in resolving problems between them. The parents were unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court in resolving disputes. The matter was remitted to the court for final disposition."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The applicant sought injunctive relief and an order prohibiting the respondent and Potash Corp. from producing and marketing potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any potassium sulfate during the life of the injunction. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the plaintiff entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's application for an interlocutory injunction to restrain and prohibit them from marketing the product. HELD: 1) The applicant was advised by its counsel that the applicant had no knowledge of the technology used by the defendant in the agreement and therefore was not privy to the information. 2) The evidence established that the defendant did not develop the ion exchange technology used in the application that was used to produce the potassium sulphates and was not the only technology licensed to the defendant by the defendants. The defendant was aware of the evidence and had acted appropriately in reaching the agreement. The information was obtained through third party vendors. Only after having acquired the assets of the defendant and acting reasonably in the manner contemplated by the agreement did the defendant establish a proprietary and confidential information relationship with the plaintiff. 3) The defendant had obtained an exclusive license from the plaintiff to marketing all of the potassium sulfates produced at its plant in Alsask. The plaintiff obtained an order terminating the defendant's exclusive marketing agreement and prohibiting them from selling or marketing the potassium in the amount of $10,000. 4) The court was required to determine costs of the application. The applicant had not established that either defendant had a proprietary interest in the scientific principles for which the Confidentiality Agreement was based. The court found that the agreement was not a patented process and that both parties were in breach of it. 5) The plaintiff was also required to pay the fee specified in the Agreement for the privilege of entering into the agreement for the purposes of the agreement which were to be paid in installments. The Court also ordered general damages to the plaintiff for failing to comply with the two agreements. 6) The Court found that it would be impossible for the defendant to establish a prima facie case that the ion exchanges and crystallization technology licensed by the plaintiff was being used by PSC Alask. That the defendant would be obliged to pay any fee specified by the Agreement. 7) The application was dismissed."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","The plaintiffs apply for certification of a proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil (Paxil). The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. An affidavit sworn by the respondent states that there was an increased risk of adverse events including but not limited to suicide, suicidal tendencies, aggressiveness, hostility and mania associated with the use of Paxil but have continuously failed to warn consumers. HELD: The application for cross-examination is granted. The defendant's request to cross-examine the plaintiff is granted with costs of the application to be borne by the party applying for the cross- examination. 1) The defendant has a relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6(d) of the Saskatchewan Act that a class action be the preferable procedure and that the exercise of that discretion may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act. 2) The common issues proposed in the application for certification are not only devoid of the allegations of harm in the statement of claim, they appear to be inconsistent with the affiant's personal expectations and motivation as he has explained them in his affidavit. Accordingly, cross--examination on his affidavit will not result in an injustice to the plaintiff. 3) There are a number of statements contained in the affidavit that, on certification application, the court will be assisted by as full picture as possible of the nature and scope of the proposed litigation, including an indication of what may be ambiguous, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in the affidavits, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the Affiant."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring for sale to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications for the processing of the product, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to 2ºC. The appellant argued that the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. The respondent contended that the Provincial Tax Commission erred in not allowing the exemption in full. In issue was whether the tax should be refunded or not. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appellant was awarded its costs. 1)In light of the recent changes in legislation, it is appropriate to raise a new point of law in the context of s.19 of the Health Services Tax Act. 2)The Provincial Tax Commissioner's decision to allow a refund on the equipment was upheld. 3)The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production. 4)The claim for refund was dismissed. 5)The evidence was not appropriate to provide additional information to the parties involved in the procedural or substantive change in the legislation. 6)Costs were awarded in the amount of $41,335 to the appellant."

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and one for driving while impaired by drugs. The accused argued that his Charter rights were guaranteed and that his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 27(5) and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or arbitrarily detained. HELD: The police officer was acquitted of both charges. 1) The Police Act must be read in a manner in which the legislature is not taken to have exceeded it's jurisdiction. The words of the individual provisions to be applied to the particular case under consideration were 'peace officer' which means that the words are clear and unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law. It would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by Federal legislation.  2) Section 21(3) is a police officer's responsibility in Canada as his territorial jurisdiction extends throughout Canada. The police officers are responsible for policing when there is an agreement between the province and the federal government. 3) The police act must be understood as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner taking away jurisdiction granted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. 4) The accused was awarded his costs of the trial. 5) The Court concluded that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. The Court found that the police officer who was responsible to follow the accused into service station at 8:20 p.m. in Edmonton was mistaken and had jurisdiction to make the demand. The officer was awarded the costs of conducting the stop. 6) Section 7 of the Highway Traffic Act is amended to provide for the purposes of s. 9 of the Traffic Act. 7) The Saskatchewan Police Force operates to render the RCMP officers part of 'police force for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law' (R. v. Ladouceur). 8) In reviewing the scheme and object of The RCMP, the Court concluded the stopping was a random check. The RCMP officers were authorized to conduct policing duties within the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Police Department. 9) The Traffic Act requires that all police officers perform all duties that are assigned to them by virtue of their assigned positions in the Police Force. 10) The RCMP are responsible to enforcing only the provincial laws of the province in which they are employed. 11) The Crown must be able to control the enforcement"
2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs plus disbursements of $1,000 plus costs of $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery rate the plaintiffs were able to recover.

The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS). The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(1) of the Income tax Act, ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the receiver. At issue was whether the Crown has jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s.238(2) ofthe Income TaxAct ordering payment of $24,068.23 or some part thereof by the respondent to the AG. HELD: The respondent was an officer and director of HRS at all times material to these offences. He operated the company with another unnamed investor. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HRS. It was not established whether the accountant or investor held in HSRP any shares in the company or the Crown. The evidence did not establish whether the individuals held in the corporation held in view of their financial circumstances nor the prospect of recovery from them. 1)The respondent was a person of relatively limited financial means with limited employment prospects. However, in the course of making the assignment for the benefit of creditors, the appellant listed Canada Customs and Revenue Agency as one of his creditors and included therein the amount of indebtedness to CCA. 2)The Crown had no jurisdiction to order an order under s.232(2). The authority of the Court to make subsection 238(2), which is to specifically make the directors of corporation financially liable for the failure of the corporation to comply with Section 153 and other provisions of the ITA, is vested in the Court of Appeal. 3)The Court's jurisdiction was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. The respondent's future prospects for employment and to earn income were likely quite good. 4)The offences occurred between the dates of February 16, 1999 and January 18, 2000. In addition to the 12 counts, the Crown had jurisdiction to issues an order in s.241(2)(i) ordering payment the amount thereof by Mr. Henneberry to the Director General and if do, whether such an order should be made."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prosecute this action without delay. The second application was granted in part. The defendants sought to amend the order to add the plaintiff and amendment the statement of claim. HELD: The preservation order was terminated pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 3-72 and 3-84. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff was denied because the amendment would not create a wholly new proceeding.  1)There was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims and the escrow agreement and preservation order. 2)Absent a third action, the court should not terminate the order or revisit the issues which the parties intended to resolve through the order.  3)The addition of ABank is appropriate in the circumstances. It is open to the court to terminate a preservation order granted by consent pursuant to the EMJA if the applicant shows grounds that would vitiate a contract. There is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the Turks will accept the balance of the shares transferred by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. The transfer of the AGT shares by the defendant to the plaintiff will not result in the dissipation of any property associated with the preservation of the property.  4)The court exercised its discretion to order ABank be added as plaintiff and that the Statement of Claim be amended in the manner proposed. 5)The application to terminate or modify the order was dismissed.  6)The applicant was granted leave to reapply pursuant to Rule 3-74 of the Queen'sBench Rules for an order that the defendant be added to the preservation Order and that it be amended to include the plaintiff in the Statement Of Claim. 7)The amendments were not allowed because of the complexity of the application. 8)The Court was awarded the costs of preparing the application pursuant to rule 3-77.

The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08.

The Crown appealed both conclusions and sought a new trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appeal is dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results of the test, or should not have, if she had, the results could be inaccurate. The certificate of Analysis was excluded from evidence at the trial. 1) The trial court found the trial court erred by determining in all of the relevant circumstances it wasn't objectively reasonable to the officer not to have used the accuracy OF the ASD. 2) The test was administered without delay. There was no delay in the application of the Statutes of the Day. 3) The tests were properly administered and the results were accurately administered. 4) The mere possibility that a driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation. The wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine. It was way past the 15 minutes necessary to obtain a reliable result.  5) The court concluded that the error was made in the manner in which it was done. The error was not addressed in the reasons for the decision as it was unnecessary to review any subsequent facts as the primary issue on appeal was the correctness of the decision to exclude the Certificate of Analysis."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Clarke should not be required to answer questions which are not answered in the course of their investigation. 3) While there may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses incurred as a result of the action or to provide answers which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment, this is not one of those situations. 4) The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they think relate and not relate the cause is of such a nature and scale that it is not appropriate. It is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. 5) The applicant's refusal to provide a response to a specific undertaking was justified.  6) The applicants were ordered to provide proper answers to questions which were not asked of them at the original time."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the applicant as her lawyer, as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel. 1) The solicitor acknowledges that the only way to resolve the conflicts would be by holding a viva voce hearing. On that basis, the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial if necessary on the issues that are in conflict. 2) The court agreed to withdraw the solicitor from the position of counsel so the parties could proceed to a pre- trial and a Trial if necessary. 3) As Mr. Miller has agreed to act as counsel for Ms. Ponder for the pre-rial, it is set for April 2006."

The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. HELD: Queen's B.C. has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Rule 485 for summary judgment. 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff is not entitled to be indemnified under the by-law. The essential nature of the debate between the union and the employee relates to the interpretation of an indemnity by the Union by-laws. 2) This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen’s Bench Court. Accordingly, the Court has jurisdiction by the Rule 487 for summary judgement."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences, namely, with intent to commit an indictable offence and having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were serving time on remand at the time of their appeal. The Court of Appeal raised the sentence to two years less a day, taking into account their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. The total of these sentences is 44 months. Although most of the offences in respect to the accused were committed when they were youth, the records show failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The sentence that each of them will serve from this date is two years to be served in a federal penitentiary."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the hallway doors on the third floor were always open and had a fire alarm system that was not working at the time of the fire. The fire alarms in the building were not working and the tenants did not have advance warning of the existence of smoke and fire. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the plaintiff's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Emergency services were called to the scene and the plaintiff was taken to the hospital. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The defendants admitted they owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs when they escaped the building, but denied it breached the standard of care. The plaintiffs suffered damages but denied they were caused by any act or omission by the defendant. The court accepted that the landlord owed a 'but for' test, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant, and that compensation for damages would have been incurred on a balance of probabilities. In this case, the defendant conceded it owed an obligation of care and liability was imposed."

He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. 1)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living with his rent and food expenses are reasonable. He has been making small payment toward his obligations. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge. 2)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to the bankrupt's low income.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving. The accused argued that the certificate of analysis should not be admitted because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the accused was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights, it should be excluded under s. 24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court found insufficient evidence to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The Evidence of Impaired Operation of Motor Vehicle was excluded as the only evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2. The Crown did not have a forensic expert called by either side as can neither take judicial notice of the fact that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment or at the 711, after drinking three or four beer within the preceding hour. She was also tired. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is not enough to prove impaired ability to operate motor vehicle."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. All of the indicia of hunting at night with the searchlight were present in this case. It was not credible to believe he was looking for a moose caller, nor was it accepted that he was shining a spotlight on his vehicle as he was driving through the forest. There were 14 rounds of ammunition located in the vehicle, which were compatible with the two rifles that were seized. However, it lacked any degree of probability that the first thought that would come to his mind, when he picked up his son and nephew, was that they had been attacked by moose in the area. There was no evidence that he had returned to the same area as the moose and was seriously concerned that the same might have beenfallen the victim.

Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with breaking and entering and stealing property. The charges were based on an incident where the accused was driving his vehicle off the road and damaged a number of properties. The Crown sought a period of six years incarceration. The accused plead guilty to one count of breaking and enter and another count of theft which was a charge of possession of a stolen weapon. He admitted that he had been involved in the break and enters and theft but argued that the offences were more serious than they were intended to be sustained. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution. The aggravating circumstances of the offence and the fact that the accused had less than perfect upbringing and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of his co-accused. The evidence of the accused's prior criminal record was sufficient to warrant a sentence of six-and-a-half years imprisonment. The sentences proposed were very similar to those in the cases before the Court of Appeal but with a reduction in the range of sentence as well as the benefit to the Crown to the accused that the Crown had received in the form of a DNA order for the first time."

The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to ss. 253B of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of Criminal Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the police officer was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s.254(2) which reads 'where there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found within easy reach of the driver. The Court found that the officer ought to have had a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make the demand immediately. The detention of the accused was not arbitrary and there was no breach of the Charter. The delay of 17 minutes from when the officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle was a violation of his Charter rights. The evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded under s24(2)."

Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the claim for damages was made merely because the sellers of the house had rented the house and the tenants had had a small flood. The motion for non-suit was brought by the self-represented plaintiff against the defendants, alleging negligence by the claimants to have caused the flooding. Dismissing the motion, that the defendants offer a plethora of defences including a doctrine of merger, that if there is a fundamental breach of contract that would lead to total lack of consideration, then the claim is not viable. The court adopted the standard of review in Pino v. Morgenstern, 2006 NSSC 146 and adopted the test for a motion for a nonsuit in the Small Claims Court, which is to determine whether a motion is a proper proceeding, and whether there is any evidence of negligent misrepresentation. The test is whether the defences are sufficiently advanced to support a claim for a damages award, and therefore sufficient evidence to support the claim. HELD: The application for a declaration of a non lawsuit was dismissed. 1)The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law such as that of a person who is familiar with the process of making a decision. 2)It was not necessary for the court to impose a sufficiency of evidence or to consider the weight or the believability of the evidence. 3)The claim was dismissed because of insufficient evidence. The doctrine of merge was not applied to the claim and the fact that the applicants disclosed their knowledge of the relevant condition of the property to the purchaser and/or their real estate agent was not a factor. 4)There was no evidence that any of the applicants had misrepresentation or misrepresentation, nor did it establish that the claims were not present at the time of the purchase.

The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendants had each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Lorne owning the trucking company. The operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows and a trailer park and a gravel pit operation. Gene and his wife Ellen were working on the farm when the quota change took place. Gene became the manager of the dairy operation. He was responsible for preparing the security documents for the defendant which included the terms'milk quota','market share', and 'expertise' on the use of the word 'quota'. The plaintiff was given a share of the proceeds of the sale of the Fluid Milk Quota but the defendant was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The plaintiff alleged that the agreement only refers to the Flud Milk Quotas and that it was obligated only to sell them. The defendant claimed that all of the assets in the plaintiff's possession belonged to the plaintiff and were not part of the quota sold. The court ordered the equitable division of proceeds into three ways: 1)The plaintiff was awarded $33,800.00 for breach of contract; 2)The defendant was found to be in breach of the terms of this agreement; 3)The agreement was subject to the defendant having to pay costs of the action in accordance with the provisions of the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board Rules. The agreement was also subject to fair and reasonable disclosure by the plaintiff in any event that the defendant may have misappropriated funds from the plaintiff. 4)The defendants were found to have breached their obligations under the terms and conditions of the original agreement."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and threatening to kill after she confronted her husband with whom she had previously been. She was found murdered in her residence with the light outs and his car hidden from her view. The Crown tendered a number of statements concerning two occasions in which the deceased stated that she had choked the accused until she thought she was going to die and then sexually assaulted her. At the onset of the trial, the Crown sought the admission of the 2 previous incidents, which were found to be identical fact evidence. The defence argued that because the accused had no motive to lie and because there were safeguards in place to protect the accused from the possibility of a lie, the evidence would have to be excluded. HELD: The evidence was admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissiblilty of similar facts evidence and was admissible on a principled basis. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the fact that the two previously incidents were extremely prejudicial in nature. The evidence could be used to show hostile behaviour by the accused that would lead to a motive to kill or to provide a circumstantial guarantee of trustworthiness. However, the trial judge must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissibility of hearsay on a second degree murder charge because the possibility that the intention to harm with the mens rea required to be convicted of murder is a serious issue."

Application dismissed; a judge of the Court of Appeal in Chambers does not have the authority to make the order requested; in any event, an application in the Family Division for leave to terminate the permanent care order would be a more appropriate way for the applicant to proceed.",The paternal grandmother applied in Chambers for an order that she be added as a party so that she can appeal a permanent care order respecting her granddaughter. The child was the subject of protection proceedings brought by the Children's Aid Society in the Family Division. The paternal grandmother did not participate in those proceedings. She now argues that a judge in Court of Appeal Chambers does not have the authority to make the order sought. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court dismissed the application. There are two bases on which this Court may add her as a partner for the purposes of appealing. The first is that the Chambers judge has jurisdiction to deal with procedural matters and the addition of a party for the purpose of appealing is a discretionary one. The second is that a Chambers judge may not have jurisdiction to make an order seeking the respondent. The Family Division not only has intimate knowledge of the permanent care proceedings but is better equipped to dealwith the evidentiary matters which are likely to arise in the course of the respondent's attempts to place her position before the Court. The third is that there are number of issues of fact surrounding the child and the proceedings as well as the Society's communications with her. Nothing which had said in these reasons should be taken as deciding any of these factual issues.

In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered in a 1987 motor vehicle accident. The defendant was found one-third responsible. The plaintiff claimed negligence based upon apportionment of costs and the effect of settlement offers made by the parties. Damage to the defendant's vehicle was determined at $1,255.25. The court apportioned costs on a party and party basis on a Tariff 'A' scale and fixed the amount at $50,000.00. Counsel advised that there may be special circumstances that would warrant an exercise of discretion. The Court reviewed the history of apportionments of costs in motor vehicle negligent cases and found that the practice followed by trial judges was to award costs in the same proportions as the findings of fault. To award costs on the counterclaim would be inequitable and unfair to the plaintiff."

The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.",The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. In 1989 Turf masters obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previous action for non-disclosure of site reports. Shortly after commencing the work Turfmasters recognized there were significant subsurface problems with the site which made their work more difficult and costly. It commenced an action against the city and the consultant for non disclosure of the site reports in the early 1990s. In the second action Turf Master commenced a claim for damages resulting from the alleged site problems. The consultant hired by the plaintiff sought to have the action struck out on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. The plaintiff brought a separate action for breach of standard of care and breach of contract alleging negligence by the City and alleged negligent misrepresentation by the consultant to the City. The defendant brought a third action for unpaid monies and sought to strike out that portion of the plaintiff's defence. The applicant brought a second action for damages which were alleged to be the same amount but which could not be determined at trial. The trial judge dismissed both of the first and the second applications. He held that to allow the plaintiff to now basically relitigate the same action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept would be an abuse of the process. He also held that many costs would have to be expended on the relitigation of the same issue.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products.

The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time. It knew that he was going to have to rely on former Atlas employees as he was not spending full time with the franchise.

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by the Kelvington Super Swine Inc.

The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property.

Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in the lawsuit involving his claim for abuse suffered at the Indian residential School, the first $50,000 will be paid into Court with the exception of paying any legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors. In the settlement the respondent is restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without an order of the Court.

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the applicant. The applicant argued that this was an application that was made under the protection order of the Minister. The Minister had requested the records because they were confidential. Application allowed; the court found that the documents were not relevant and that a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding had been requested in this case. For the applicant, that the court's duty to 'investigate' and to obtain information that may confirm or deny its suspicions about the applicant's past, present and future did not waiver from the requirement that the applicant have access to these records. The court found the applicant’s request for the records to be irrelevant because it was a request made under a protection order and not under a consent order. The documents were also not relevant because they did not comply with the conditions of the order. This was not a request to which the applicant was entitled to seek further information or to alter its expectations and plan of care."

San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty.

The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in the mother's name to the plaintiff and two other children, Bruce and Wanda. After Mabel died in March 1998, the plaintiff's wife, the mother of the four granddaughters, took the position of the litigation guardian of the bank account and became the trustee for the account. The bank account was in the plaintiff name at the time of the deceased's death. The deceased had been diagnosed with cancer in late 1997. It was terminal. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. The plaintiff's mother had given the instructions to her daughter in 1992 to prepare four cheques of $5,000 for each of the grandchildren. The following Sunday, Pennefather died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The day after the instructions were given to Brenda, she left the bank accounts to her husband, who died shortly after Royal Trust had completed its instructions. The husband died before the instructions could be endorsed by the wife, who submitted that the wife had divested herself of any interest in the stocks and Royal Trust was trustee for her daughter. The wife was 'volunteer' not having given any consideration to either Royal Trust or Royal Trust companies which would create an equity in her favour. HELD: The claim against the plaintiff was dismissed with costs. 1)The written instructions were never intended to be completed satisfactorily. The gift of $25,000 was intended to divide the grandchildren's estate equally. 2)The wife was not a party to the trust. The gifts were given solely to benefit her four grandchildren and were not intended to convert into a full-fledged trust. 3)The gift of the title and title of an acre of land was never converted into a monetary instrument. The written instructions did not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust.  4)The prescribed prescribed amounts were $5k and $5000 for the purpose of payment of debts of the estate, with the balance to be divided between the four grandchildren."

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.",A tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant claimed that notice given to him by the landlord was inadequate and he was not prepared to refute the amount of his cleaning claim. He also claimed that the notice he received was inadequate in denying natural justice and due process by proceeding with insufficient notice of the particulars of the claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Rentalsmen's decision was patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the facts and therefore unreasonable. The Rentalsmans decision was also an error of law in denying the natural justiceand due process. 2)The appeal was also supported by the evidence. 3)The rentalsman reached a decision based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not unreasonable given that evidence.
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. In addition, she requests that the court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father agreed, as part of the distribution of the family property between the parties, to assume responsibility for a capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as partof the family farm. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) The mother is requesting the father establish his 2008 income so that the parties can avoid costly court proceedings. 3) The Court in Andersen v. Andersen found that the income for the basis of calculating child support should be based solely on his 2007 tax return and not an averaging of his previous three years. 4) The fact the father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The mother would then be forced to remit back to the father the overpayment."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The parties appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute between them. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the issues between the two parties. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Court did not wish to be taken to approve of the procedure followed by the court. 2)Three grounds of appeal were appealed. The $230.00 per month the appellant was ordered to pay in respect of extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities with the meaning of s7(1)f of the Divorce Act were dismissed. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. 3)No reversible error was explained in his reasons for his decision, supported by written reasons. He did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the guidelines. He was not entitled to extraordinary expenses. 4)The portions of the judgments relating to payment under s7 and 1(f) were set aside and each party shall bear his and her own costs."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The Respondent did not file a defence and the plaintiff obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The defendant claimed the Alberta court did not have jurisdiction. The parties appeared before the trial judge for hearing on the issue of whether the small claims court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the claimants. The matter proceeded by way of argument and the adjudicator determined that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further decided that, although the Court had jurisdiction in Nova Scotia and Alberta, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to the Act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small claims Court Act."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction.

Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to be joined as an amicus curiae, or as an intervener, pursuant to Rule 8.02. The Union opposed all of the applications advanced by the union, claiming that the trial judge erred in law in permitting the sole defendant(s) to stand as sole defendants in the proceeding, and in denying status to the union. The only other party that opposed the application was the Union's solicitor, who was not served on behalf of the Union as counsel for the Union. The union requested that the orders of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal be varied so that the Union could continue to file an appeal. The court dismissed the application as an application for joinder, and noted that there were no precedents or precedents for the use of the term 'unnamed persons' in the context of the applicable legislation."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18, but in view of the respondent's stated intention to return to his parents' home on his 16th birthday, which was granted at trial, the Department sought an order placing him with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of [J.S.] and [E.K.] but seeks the return of [C.S.].

The Court ordered that the children remain in the custody of their parents until the age of 18. 4) The children shall have access with their grandmother as per the terms and conditions of the order in which the order is made.

HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances.

The Young Person was 18 years old and was serving a sentence of 180 days open custody followed by 90 days in the community, concurrent. The issues were: 1) whether the young person is likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence; 2) whether there are compelling reasons for keeping the young Person in custody. HELD: The application was granted. The young person was released pending a full hearing of the application. 1) The Court must necessarily look to these factors to determine whether there were compelling reasons to hold the youngperson pending hearing.  2) Section 98(3)(b) provides the criteria for the decision to order the youth person continue in custody until the expiring of the community portion of the sentence and must be considered when answering the question, 'Are there compelling reasons?' pending the hearing of this application. Section 99(4) provides for the application to continue to a hearing although the Court has declined to hold him in custody; 3) a review of the governing criteria for continuation is to be considered within a reasonable time having regard to the circumstances. 4) The information contained in the report was of a substantial nature and was to be of assistance to the Court. 5) There was likely relevant information which was not provided to the court as the application was not brought to the hearing on its own.  6) The application for continuation was allowed. The matter of release pending a hearing was adjourned for a further hearing."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to reconsider the first two orders. The hotel employees union members who filed complaints against the respondent also appealed. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for a rehearing, that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decisions, and in the absence of such a requirement it is not necessary to deal with the other issues. The giving of reasons serves several purposes. First, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been considered (the absence of reasons would have been desirable). Second, it provides some assurance that the decision-maker, through three levels of immigration officials, has considered the applicant's submissions directly. As there was evidence upon which the Board could find that the applicant committed an unfair labour practice, the decision of the Board was not patently unreasonable. Third, the evidence relating to comment made by counsel for the respondent Union and to smiles or laughter on the part of some members of the board did not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Board's decisions were protected by the privative clause in s. 19(1) of the Act. They could only be reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness of the decisions. It was not possible to determine from the order of the panel what subsection of s. 53 of the Trade Union Act the Board found was violated, giving rise to an unfair labor practice. The Committee concluded that there was no such thing as a presumption of innocence. The Court ordered the Board to give reasons. It is not sufficient for an appellant to satisfy the Court that, within the range of discretion conferred upon the tribunal, it might or even would have reached a different conclusion. The foregoing considerations do not preclude the granting of reasons by the Board."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as it did in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance. The Board misinterpreted the wording of the policy, which provided that an unmarried mother, pending the birth of her first child, could qualify for assistance if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support. The fact that the respondent's stepfather was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived was not evidence that she qualified as a person in need under the policy."

Although the plaintiff's claim is fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant applies for an order of this nature dismissing the respondent's motion for dismissal of the action. The appeal is allowed in part. There has been significant delay in the plaintiff’s action and it will probably be many months or longer before the plaintiff is tried.

However, there are a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the actions.

As well, the appellant has leave to plead to any new matters raised in the respondent”s statement of claim."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The Court reviewed the cases and found that s. 33.1 does away with the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' in the rarest of cases. 2) The accused raised three potential defences. The first was that the Crown failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity. He argued that at the time of the alleged assault, he was so intoxicated that he was not in conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sex with her. He never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. 3) In a sexual assault case, the self- induced gross intoxication of the complainant does not preclude a particular defence. It is difficult to understand how someone who renders themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through the voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a blameworthy state of mind that allows for an actus reus to exist. The accused testified that he didn't even think about having sexual intercourse the previous evening until his sister was able to arouse him. She concluded that he had raped the complainant and she felt hurt that he took advantage of her. 4) The evidence raised by the defence was that it was an unsupported and inherently unreliable assertion. It was not reasonable to conclude that the person who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of forming a reasonable belief that she consented to having sex with him. It would not be fair to rely on her bare denial which, because she has no memory, is in effect an assumption by her. 5) In the case before me, the accused was acquitted on the basis that his extreme drunkenness was not a defence to an assault type of charge described in ss. 33(3). The Court held that the lack of general intent or voluntariness (which is usually an integral element of any criminal offence) was not sufficient to cause the accused to commit such an offence. The court reviewed the expert evidence tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the accused's evidence as to the state of his intoxication.  6) The court has a discretion to vary in sentences"
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim released order containing certain terms. The picketing prohibition term of his release from custody was considered necessary by the justice who made the order to address the substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. 1)Criminal offences were reasonably restrained as a condition of release under the terms of the release of the accused from custody. 2)If the amendment was granted as sought by the accused he would restrict his picketing to lawful activity.
b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge on the return date granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given in the examination for discovery of Krake and ordered that the documents be produced in such a fashion as to be of sufficient interest to the plaintiff to a trial judge. The plaintiff also requested that the defendant's solicitor should be ordered to supply the plaintiff with specific answers to questions as to audit working patterns related to investments made by the Trust Company and the requisite part of the document referred to as'matters for attention of partners as at December 31, 1985'. HELD: The plaintiff's motion was granted. The defendant's lawyer was ordered to answer certain questions outlined in the plaintiff's brief and during the argument for the cause.  1)The plaintiff was required to answer questions which he refused to answer or took under advisement.  2)The discovery and production of the documents in question will not hamper the search for truth. Indeed, it should help to isolate the areas of contention for trial purposes. 3)The defendant was ordered by the court to make full disclosure of any documents which were not originally disclosed by the plaintiff prior to any examination or continued. 4)Costs were awarded to the defendant in any event of the cause 5.The plaintiff failed to establish that the plaintiff was entitled to discovery of documents which directly or indirectly allowed him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either of these consequences.  5)A pre-trial conference was ordered.  6)The court ordered that all documents be properly described and identified as to documents and that portions of which could be said to be not related to the matters in question be allowed."

HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited.

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) had be infringed. HELD: The accused was found not to have been detained, his detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a 'de facto' arrest. The accused's continued detention after he was 'excluded' from the search and seizure constituted a de facto arrest. 1)The accused's right to a fair trial had ended as a result of the arrest and detention without charge or detention or any reasonable search or seizure resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter.  2)The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported “un-arrrest” of the defendant, and that was provided to him by the police. The continued detention of him after the alleged “de facto” arrest constituted ade facto arrest as described in Latimer. There was no suggestion in the evidence before me that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the “undesirables” (such as being detained for questioning) or that his detention on his own initiative amounted to a de- facto arrest, which in this case was not an arbitrary arrest."
7_1996canlii6810.txt,"An application for an interim injunction restraining the Regina Exhibition Association (REAL) from interfering with GCB's enjoyment of certain leasehold premises in the Jubilee Building and from entering into any lease with Regina Central Bingo (RCBA) and preventing the operation of a bingo hall by RCBA within Exhibition Park except as sub-tenant of GCB. The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant from and after September 1, 1996. The defendant sought an interim injunction restraining REAL from permitting the use of the premises by the plaintiff except as subtenant of the defendant. REAL was not aware of the sublease and was not asked to provide its consent, as required by the lease and the first sub-lease. HELD: The application for an interim injunctive injunction was dismissed. 1)There was no negotiations between REAL and the defendant regarding the bingo halls. There was no promise on the part of REAL to follow up on these discussions, nor was there any discussion about exercising the option to renew either through the defendant or directly.  2)The defendant failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer from the refusal of the injunction greater than that which will be suffered if it is granted. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish that the defendant, the party with whom REAL had contracted, exercised or attempted to exercise the option, was the party to which REAL had been privy to the negotiations."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash that investigation and for an order to return all of the emails and other documents that had been obtained as part of the respondent's interlocutory application. The chambers judge essentially granted the applicant's application and dismissed the Commission's's's' application with respect to the notice of examination and other evidence obtained in the course of its investigation. The Commission seeks leave to appeal and direct that the underlying judicial review application be stayed. There are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed even before the privilege issue is addressed. The issues raised on appeal are one that fall within s. 29F(2) and s.29F(3) do not appear on its face to provide the only mechanism to resolve issues of solicitor-client privilege. However, deference is due to the Commission in the sense that it ought to have taken its complaints to the Court first and not the Courts by certioraris application."

The appellant contends that he was unaware that an accident had taken place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident took place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he did not Know had happened prior to returning from the Store. There was no palpable or overriding error.  1) The trial judge did give sufficient reasons for her decision and took into consideration all of the relevant evidence and the law in reaching her decision. She was entitled to assess credibility of the independent witness and the appellant, deciding to prefer the evidence of the independant witness to that of the appellant. 2) The court did not rely upon the testimony of any witness that was inherently improbable, and she applied the correct burden of proof, beyond reasonable doubt, in reaching the verdict. 3) The verdict was not unreasonable. He had no obligation to report such accident which was not know had happened before returning to the store.

It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law.

The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing order to include a provision that the parties would share joint custody of the children, whose primary residence was in Halifax. The respondent mother sought interim custody. The children's school and after school care had been changed once in the past few months. There had been some difficulty in the transition from the Halifax area to Bridgewater, which is close to the children's community. The mother had to seek an order of the Court confirming the change in the circumstances of the case. Application to vary existing order granted; the mother was ordered to have access only on the second weekend of each month and on the third day of the school year. The parties had to vary their order to reflect the new reality. It was not in their best interests to remain in the mother's care beyond the end of the year.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person applied for an exclusion order from attending a youth court pre-sentencing conference. The young person entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period. The defendant applied to have the conference excluded from view. Counsel for the youth person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from the conference. This was an attempt to address concerns raised by some members of the public about the adequacy of government programs and support for the troubled young person, who apparently suffers from mental health issues and who is in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services. In addition to the public, the defendant's relatives and friends are also invited to attend. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) The court found that the use of conferences to deal with youth in conflict with the criminal law was not a public proceeding and the burden of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The court ordered that the conference be held in open court. 2) The applicant's application was based on a situation where a court, in its discretion to exclude members of public and media, would be prejudiced in favour of the defendant given the information contained in the conference report. 3) The evidence before the court rebutted the open court principle and supported an order pursuant to s.132 of the Act. 4) The Crown and the defendant had joint jurisdiction over the entire conference and invited the media to participate."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for spousousal and further agreed that a reduction in the husband's income as a consequence was or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The agreement provided for annual adjustments based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The wife's modest income provided any proper ground for variation. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support. The fact it had now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest Income provides any proper grounds for variation of the agreements."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy under s. 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The provisions of the Act allow for an order annulling an assignment made on an interim basis. The bankrupt argued that he received wrong legal advice concerning the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)An annulment of the assignment would be dangerous because it would result in the creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain of the builders' liien claimants had already commenced an action. 2)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthly financial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The decisions relating to this issue were carefully reviewed. 3)Having used s. 15(automatic discharge) as a criterion in this situation, the court should by order annul the bankruptcy. It would set a dangerous precedent that would require the bankrupt to apply for an early discharge before that time as provided for in section168.1(2) of the act. Once again the bankrupt must cooperate with the trustee in order to ensure he has met his obligations in order for him to avoid an objection being filed by the trustee. In the end result the application by the bankrupt for an ordered annuling his assignment is dismissed."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement (finance) in 1997 with the value of the sprayer being agreed to be $94,600. The price of a sprayer was $23,650. The trade-in was agreed to have value of $10,000 as down payment and was to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayereder. The issue was not plead in defence but in the framework of a summary trial. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease, but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of a pumper at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act.  2)The primary incidents of ownership are use of the painter for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest in the sprayers and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the currency. The Agreement does not determine the market value at the end of the Agreement in June 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair value in June, 2002 or equivalent to it, or more. 3)The agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest. The primary incidents were use and the obligation of investment and acquisition of a substantial Interest in the paintereder, acquisition and maintenance and insurance. The termination value was $679.33 (between $ 10,000.00 and $9,320.67). The central issue was if the Agreement is a lease and is covered by the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The parties agreed to enter into a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the owner elected to pay off the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. 4)The parties did not canvass the circumstances within the framework as they did in a pre-trial conference."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser for damages. The appellant appealed. The preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs. 1) There is nothing in the reasons that the Chambers judge touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. 2) The appellant has no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against a surface parcel owned by the respondent. 3) There are no considerations which indicate that the appellant in any way touched upon that substantive issue. The application for registration of an interest was dismissed. 4) The respondent had not filed a statement of defence at the time it made the application and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was based on an appeal of a sentencing judge who failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code. The sentencing judge did not comply with his obligations under the Act. HELD: 1) The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a Victim surcharge in the amount of $30. The surcharge is waived notwithstanding that the Respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 730 of the Code (the 'Code'). If an offender is exempted from payment of a victim surcharges, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons. 2) The trial judge failed to meet the maximum sentence requirements set out in s. 687(1). The maximum amount of surcharges is 15 per cent of the total sentence. 3) In this case, the sentencing judge raised an important issue which is undue hardship. This is particularly important given that the sentencing judges are employed to ensure that the entire criminal justice system is paid in such a fashion that undue hardship to the offender and dependents of the offender would result. This important evidence has been consistently raised by the trial judge in order to determine the appropriate surcharge. This evidence has consistently raised important issues of financial hardship and the Court has varied the sentence accordingly. In this regard, the maximum surcharge of 21 per cent is imposed."
d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's conclusion was supported by the facts. The appellant's belief was based on the observation that the accused was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the indicia of impairment. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot Eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer had observed provide ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. The Court found that the trial Judge was in an advantageous position to rely on the evidence and found that she had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the breath. The appeal court found that it was not unreasonable for the officer to demand the breath sample when she was in the police vehicle and then at the police station at 12:29 a.m. The accused's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and reasonable grounds to arrest him and demand that he provide sample of his breath for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter and in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act, and in excluding the s.8, or 10(B) indicia. The evidence was all there was to support the conclusion that she was not certain if she was operating her motor vehicle as impaired as possible and that her claim for breach of the charter must fail. The Certificate of Analysis was found to be a valid certificate of analysis and the certificate of breath sample was also valid. The Crown appealed the conviction. Appeal dismissed. The court found with respect to the appeal that the court found the officer, in a situation where she was confronted with the evidence of her observations, was reasonable and supported"
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving under the influence of alcohol and driving while intoxicated. The police officer concluded that the accused believed he was reporting the accident and gave self-incriminating statements to the police as a result of this belief. He placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and Demand for Blood and found that the statements were self- incriminating and conscriptive. The accused testified on the voir dire that if he accepted that he was given the police warning, it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from evidence at trial. The evidence received, the statements in particular were self incriminating. If the accused believes he is reporting an accident, and gives self-inforcing statements to police, then the trial will be unfair. The statements are made with a real sense of urgency, which leads the accused to believe that he has a legal obligation to report the accident. However, if the statements are self-induced, then it is impossible to exclude them from the trial. In the case before us, the self- referencing statements that were made under compulsion of statute have been excluded. It is not followed that any evidence that came about as a consequence of the the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s7 rights. The officer was not placing the accused on a bus or driving a truck or driving on a highway. The defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by breach of his section 7 rights and was self- incriminating, the arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that information was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. The Crown contended that if the defence accepted that the officer had given a 'warning' and that he understood the statements made, then there would be nothing to exclude but the exclusion of those statements would be an unfair and unconscionable violation of his rights because none of the statements amounted to anything more than mere paranoid statements and would result in the accused not having to continue answering questions from the officer under the compulsion of a statute."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether a Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to the testimony of his former common law wife and friend. Defence counsel initially opposed the use of the drug, but later withdrew his request for a warning. The appellate court concluded that the trial judge erred in law in failing to give a sufficient warning to both the complainant and the witness. The court also concluded that there was a risk that the drugs, which had been found in the defendant's truck, would be used to commit the offence. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; defendant's appeal dismissed; the court found that the defendant’s appeal of the conviction was not based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence but on the fact that the scientific evidence did not support the version of events given by the complainant. There was no evidence to support the contention made by the Crown that the bullet from the handgun that had been fired belonged to the defendant."

HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000.

The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost of $18,000 due to a counterclaim filed by the respondent. The respondent commenced another separate lien action against certain lands respecting the work done. The latter action was a defence and counterclaim. HELD: The order for security for the costs was vacated.  1)Section 56(1) creates a discrete process to vacate a lien, which in this case fits within the meaning of the Act. 2)An order for costs will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against the counterclaim if the security is restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper.  3)The presence of the counter claim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for Security for costs. In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made against the plaintiff. 4)In exercising its discretion under rule 537, the court may consider any relevant matter other than to say that no order was made. 539(c) should be invoked. 541(d) is a factor to be considered, albeit a compelling one. 574(a) indicates discretion rather than an absolute prohibition. 575(b) indicates a discretion not to impose costs. 6)The plaintiff is entitled to costs."

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years for a sexual assault where there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and claimed the property damage and vandalism had nothing to do with the offence. HELD: A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre was justified. 1)Having imposed a custodial sentence of less than 2 years, the Court must now deal with s.742.1 of the Criminal Code which permits the Court to allow the accused to serve his term in the community. This section has just recently come into force. The Court was not aware of any judicial cases applying this section in sexual assault cases. It was therefore of the view that given the seriousness of the offence, it would be contrary to the administration of justice to permit the accused, who appears to meet the requirements of s. 741.1(a) and (b) of the Code. 2)The accused had no prior criminal record. His actions had affected him so gravely that he was on the verge of nervous breakdown.

The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The Crown contended the sentence inadequately reflected the element of deterrence and that it was inadequate having regard to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the respondent. The sentencing judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case."
6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and the estate of her late mother. The appellant and the respondents were children of the late Mrs. Scott. A probate court judge had found in 1993 that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her sister, which she did. The sister and her husband, who lived in New Brunswick, had placed the money in an investment certificate in the sole name of Ms. Akerley rather than her own name or in their joint names. The probate judge determined that in 1993, the deceased withdrew $80,000 from the joint account and placed it in the investment certificate which was in her sole name rather than Ms.'s. The interest was to be paid on maturity and the deceased was entitled to the funds. The parties appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate Court judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility. The evidence was such that he did not misconstrue the evidence, lacked an evidentiary basis for his findings, relied upon incorrect legal principles, or failed to apply or misapplied the law. His decision regarding the joint bank accounts and the presumption of resulting trusts was very fact specific and the same standard applies to questions of mixed law and fact, unless a question of law is readily extricable when the standard will be that of correctness."

He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed. Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. Although he was not hospitalized and never required surgery, he was by all accounts completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment, including farming, forestry, and pulpwood.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The appellant appealed the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the appellant, Farm Credit Canada (hereafter 'the R.M.'), even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the leasehold mortgage gave the appellant no enforceable rights against the respondent's fee simple interest but it did confer rights on the appellant and such rights were enforceable against FCC. 2) Up to the time of registration the respondent had agreed to a delay in favour of the respondent, the appellant's mortgage was prior in time to that agreement but as yet unregistered. The respondent had not agreed to the terms of the LTA as it was a mortgage of a limited interest. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the applicant. 3) The LTA is only effective according to its terms and the instrument or law on which the interest is based and is not deemed to be valid through registration. 4) The respondent's position after registration of the caveat could only be the same as if the equitable mortgage itself could have been and had been registered as an instrument under the Act. 5) In the present case the two equitable mortgages which are in competition are not the same. That of the appellant was expressly limited to charge upon'my equity' as defined by the RFL and the mortgage by the Credit Union was not registered until April 2002. 6) The appellant is seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by relying on its prior registration and the priority provisions of LTA."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to 12 months imprisonment. The Court found that the three had acted in good faith and were at low risk to re-offend. The offences occurred over a period of 13 days. The three accused admitted to the breaking and entering of a dwelling house and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm. They each entered guilty pleas to using an imitation firearm while committing this offence and a breach of a probation order on the same date. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition order and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The accused gave a written statement to the court shortly after their arrest, giving a statement to both the police and Probation Services as being at medium risk to reapply for the offence. The RCMP were not able to determine with any precision what each accused did in the house and the Crown's position was sustainable. The events happened quickly and intensely. The victim was available to testify at the preliminary hearing because he was in custody but he had not offered his complete co-operation to the Crown. The defence sought a blood alcohol order, firearms prohibition and a DNA conviction. HELD: A decision on an appropriate sentence must be made with reference to the principles of sentencing.  1) The accused did not file a victim impact statement with the court and he was not overly co-operative with the Crown once he was out of custody. 2) The Crown relied on the information contained in the pre-sentence report and the submissions by the counsel in respect to each accused. 3) The Court was unable to determine the impact of the offence on the victim personally or in the context of the offences committed. The evidence showed that the accused had a high level of remorse and that they were trying to learn from each other. It would appear that they engaged in activity that incited these three accused to take some action, once their complaints to police went unaddressed. The experienced skateboarder who had recently graduated from high school and had some professional sponsorships was also involved. He was in good physical and mental health but he was also in the habit of drinking and doing so alone. He had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08.

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The purpose of proceedings in the Family Division is not to 'find fault' or to 'right wrong'. It is to solve the problem, (in case such as this where there are no children) and provide support to an entitled party after a relationship has ended. This work is conducted in an environment that must recognize and assist a significant number of petitioners and respondents who are self represented. These are circumstances where a confidentiality order should only be granted when there is a serious risk to an important interest in the context of litigation, when reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk, and when the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by the order. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects because the public interests in an 'open court' are not limited to that. The principles of the 'necessity' branch of the rules set out in Dagenais and Canadian Broadcasting do not provide any weight to the public's expectations of privacy and confidentiality. There is no publication ban in this case. In fact, most of the material in the file must be filed by the rules of court and on occasion, court order. Any attempt to collect the required disclosure, while removing identifiers so that they would be provided when necessary but remain undisclosed, would be cumbersome and costly to the parties and to the court's administration."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit and himself spent $20,000 trying to furnish the unit prior to renting it. The decision to advertise the unit for rent was a macro decision based on his business going forward. None of the macro decisions can be attributed to the respondent.  2) The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term of one year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the Fixed Term of 1 year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012. 3) The landlord failed to prove entitlement to rent revenue loss."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by s.7 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether the regulation violated his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. 1)The evidence presented was that the accused, as a Treaty Indian, was fishing for food in a location close to the mouth of the Canoe Lake Lake, and therefore within the purview and discussion of the members of the band, the proposed closure was a conservation measure in and of itself not an infringement on the Treaty right. 2)Although the accused had no claim to the actus reus of the substantial charge, his evidence was uncontradicted by any defence evidence. His evidence was found to rest on his claim that the regulations were not in breach of his Treaty rights. 3)The issue of whether the closure should be continued or discontinued was not decided on the basis of the written notice but rather by the oral evidence presented."

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused based on his failure to identify the accused at the preliminary inquiry, the fact that he was not in the Club, the failure to provide a description of the persons in the line-ups, and his attempt to deceive the Court into believing that the person he was trying to identify were the same person the accused accused accused of fabricating."

The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: a 36% interest in trucking company called 'Titan Transport Ltd.' The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The very duties her new partner was to perform were for the company's bottom line. His income was increased roughly 50% even without regard to the shareholder bonus. The wife argued that the 'working bonus' did not have to be repaid to the corporation and there was no independent verification that the shareholders bonus must be repaid, or that they are, in fact, being retained in the company. Spousal and support will be varied to $3,500 per month effective May 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. HELD: An increase is warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. The company's retained earnings, year by year, were $2,450 for house repairs, maintenance and yard work, $2600 for house cleaning and $1,600 for travel and auto expenses are now paid by the company; the wife's income was $1 million at the end of 2001. 1)The company's earnings were not materially changed. The fact that the wife was living with the new partner did not material change the wife’s means and needs. The income of the company was increased by roughly 50%. The rental income in the amount of $400 per month was frozen at the time of the application. 2)The only material change was the fact that she was residing in her new residence. Their arrangements essentially allows the husband to live in her house at no Cost In exchange for performing yard labour and house work. The job market has declined sharply that year. On the most favourable scenario for the husband, his income has increased roughly 25%. There is also the fact the husband has new partner who pays him rental income, and certain of his expenses for his travel and car expenses are reimbursed by him."

She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship.

He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship.

HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. Art and Laura opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. HELD: 1) The children were placed with the MSS. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s.37(1) which was a permanent settlement and is in effect a pre-conditional order to the children being placed with their parents. The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. The physical plant of the foster home must present some challenges. However, the children are doing well at school and generally seem to be able to carry on daily activities. There is no evidence that any of the children posed a risk to the parents. They are just regular regular children, doing their best to be compliant and respectful of one another. The parents' relationship with their children was tumultuous at times. The Court was of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the parents had sexually assaulted the children. The evidence established that the boys had been exposed to sexual activity by their grandparents and that their parents were often in the habit of viewing them naked and masturbating in front of their children. Although they had no contact with the children, they were exposed to their parents and they were able to learn how to deal with it. Although the children did not have any contact with their biological parents, their relationship was closer to that of a normal family relationship and the Court was satisfied that they had a normal relationship and that they were committed to each other. The mother was not opposed to the application but opposed it based upon the evidence of her own daughter. The father was sentenced to 21 months and 3 years probation. 2) The Court held that the convictions were an injustice because the children truly needed stability and routine. They were forced to work. They can and do cope. There are circumstances that require a complete and complete commitment by the parents to provide for their children's needs and their own protection. The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. If a child is found in need of protection, the Court is required to look firstly at s.38(1), which requires determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with"
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a); trafficking and conspiracy to traffic.  The accused had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy, one for trafficking. He was not married, had no children nor was he employed at the time of the offence. He began drug use in his late teens. HELD: 1) The accused was given credit of 1 and 1/2 days for each day he spent on remand and 21 days credit for the time he spent in custody. 2) The Court found that the nature and quantity of the drugs found in the accused's possession for the purpose of trafficking constitute an aggravating factor. 3) He was found to have a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking, conspiracy to do so, and had nine previous drug related convictions. He qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The Court concluded that there were few mitigating circumstances that could and should properly take into account in reaching the sentencing decision. Applicable sentence of 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At the time of the application, the petitioner was 13 years old and the respondent was in the primary care of her mother. The petitioner claimed that he was unemployed since the 1995 judgment and that he suffers from chronic depression and anxiety. HELD: The application was dismissed. Nothing had changed to warrant a variation of the 1995 custody order. The material change threshold had not been met. The applicant would have been able to bring an application to vary with respect to the same relief if supported by the appropriate financial disclosure and documentation. 1)The fact that the respondent and the petitioner were not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting was not germane to the application. 2)The respondent failed to file any income tax returns, notices of assessment or pay stubs or disability income pay stub. 3)There was no evidence of a material change in circumstances relevant to custody or to the termination of the arrears of child support. 4)The petitioner was 15 and presumably all the wiser than she was two years ago."

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had presented no evidence upon which a jury could find that the defendants, who were engaged and retained to represent and defend the plaintiff, had breached their duty of care. It found that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that negligence caused her to be convicted of one or more of the charges. The plaintiff was given some direction in the court's reply to a question of convenience as to whether or not the appellants had met the standard of care required by The Medical Professions Act, 1981. It then proceeded to grant the non-suit applying the Supreme Court's decision in ter Neuzen v. Korn (1995), 127 D.L.R. (4th) 577. The Court of Appeal did not pronounce the Nova Scotia decision in the case of Hagblom v. Henderson and Campbell but it was clear that matters falling within the ordinary common sense of a juries can be judged to be negligent. The Supreme Court concluded that the test for professional negligence was not open to the jury as it was not articulated in the trial judgment nor in the notice of motion filed by the plaintiff. The trial judge, weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation, applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non-suicide."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the complainant admitted into evidence oral statements made to her neighbour and to the police. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown had found sufficient indicia of reliability in all of the cases that it had examined. The only issue was whether there were sufficient indicias of reliability to substitute for the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping.  1) The accused's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether the complainant's alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial. 2) In both K.G.B. and R.v. U. (F.J.) (supra), the court found that the test of necessity has been met.  3) The Court found that there were enough indicia to substitute the lack or absence of cross examination and absence video tape as an exception to the hearsay rule.  4) The Crown came to rely on the indicia that were found in the complainant’s statement. The fact that a witness was available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'. In the case at hand, it was clear that the complainant was upset and crying and that there was nothing other than a hostile experience on her part. Whether her alcohol consumption at the party that night had erased her memory of events and whether she is a hostile Witness was immovable at this stage. Either way, she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of theCD-ROM because the accused entered guilty plea. Now, the journalists wish to hear and view that evidence. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant that it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access to the CD-RROM. Both counsel agree that the proper court to determine the issue of access is the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD to the applicant. HELD: The applicant seeks an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The court is the appropriate Court to obtain such relief.  1) The presumption in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S., [2000] S. J.S. at para. 8, the governing principle is that the right of access to judicial records has never been considered absolute. There is a presumption in favor and public access is always subject to public access, and the presumption is in favour in favour, public access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. 2) The applicant is entitled to its own devices and media access. The access granted to its members of the media and their devices and devices are made available to them. 3) There is an emphasis on rehabilitation and education during sentencing. Counsel for the applicant sees the need to utilize regular business hours and attend the public hearings and attend regular business meetings. 4) The court has made it clear that it is in the business interests of the applicant to make this request and that its members are encouraged to use their devices, especially in business, to attend its business meetings and to participate in its duties.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties had been able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child”s needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs.

HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. 1) The Crown has power under ss. 590 to order a single count be divided where it is satisfied the ends of justice require it.  2) In light of a newly amended indictment, the two accuseds are re-elected to be tried by judge and jury. The Crown chose not to appeal those findings of the trial judge with which it did not agree. 3) The Court was of the view that there was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings of Klebuc J. in relation to the original indictment. The Court would have preferred to have the results of that trial be decided on the basis of those findings. 4) In some cases the Crown conceded that it was not bound in the proceeding by the conclusions of the judge in the Schafer judgment but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). 5) In other cases the Court was unable to determine from the indictment which of the original allegations the Crown was still pursuing against the former co-accused or whether it had now abandoned any of those matters."

The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; that the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The evidence established that the defendants were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for an equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in December of 1997. Each has significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased in value since that date. They agreed in their wills that after their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1) The petitioner was awarded half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: half of one-half of the sale of the condominium, one half the furniture, vehicle and camper; $54,000.00. There was no conflict in the evidence of the parties' intentions as to the verbal agreement they made at the marriage.  2) The respondent was not found to have an extraordinary circumstance as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the value from being divided equally between the parties. 3) The court was not satisfied there was any 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided by s. 21(1)(a) as set out in the Family Property Act. The petitioner's investments and assets were increased significantly during the marriage and were paid in full by the respondent. 4) The parties' intention was not to divide their assets and were not bound by any verbal agreement."

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving.

The appellant argues that, without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; conviction sets aside. There was no rational conclusion from which the trial judge could conclude Fleury was travelling on Highway 11 and he could not have made a 90° left turn at a substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two lanes of traffic. The trial judge erred in concluding that the only conclusion that could be drawn from the scene was that Fleury had rolled through the stop sign at such a high speed. There could be no other conclusion as to how Fleury could have made such a sharp left turn without leaving the tracks."

Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was employed as a doorman and relief bartender at the Penitentiary. He met some friends and associates, and spent the night socializing and dancing. At around 3:00 a.m. he was approached by the accused who asked him to 'bring it on'. The accused said he did not want to get involved with the accused and that he 'needed a clear shot'. He claimed the accused punched him on the back of the head and around the eye and that the accused threw a punch at him. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm. HELD: The facts were found to be as stated by the Crown witnesses, with the qualification that Baikie did indeed attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by Layman. He may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so, but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In hisinebriated state, he was no threat to the accused. The co-accused in fact took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating blow' to him which did not prevent him from falling out of the chair or the impact of the blow. The defence did not accept the accused's argument that he threw the punch, nor did he accept the evidence that he did so. He was not trying to get out of his own head or to prevent the accused from getting knocked out. Neither of these facts was accepted by the Court."

The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","The plaintiff brought three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. The plaintiff brought motions seeking a stay of those charges on the basis his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and by the RCMP during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation, which he controlled. He also brought additional testimony from RCMP officers and evidence from a senior officer who was in the Halifax Police Office during his tenure. The latter testified that he did not influence the OSB during its investigation of the plaintiff's activities. The defendant now suggests that the evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the Superintendent to testify at the hearing of the Charter Motions. Application dismissed; the accused has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that the Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The testimony and documentation presented since the Subpoena was quashed do not provide any basis to compel his attendance.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.

The tenant's application for possession was not formally before the hearing hearing officer at the same time as the landlord's application.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused entered guilty pleas to three charges. The accused admitted to touching the victims under their clothing and then touching them over the top of their clothes. There was no medical evidence or corroboration of digital penetration. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was digital penetration on the part of the accused. The Court was satisfied that the accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The alleged offences occurred over a number of years. The Crown asked the Court to find the accused had repeated sexual assaults of young girls over a period of time. HELD: The Court found that both the victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions. Based on the evidence and applying the McKenzie analysis, the accused's credibility was not reduced by the knowledge that the victims recalled only a couple of incidents when the accused was in the company of the girls. The facts were found to be aggravating factors pursuant to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. The first aggravating factor was the frequency of the assaults. The defence argued that the sexual assaults occurred over several years. However, the test is not the number of incidents. The test is whether the incidents occurred exactly as the accused said they did. The victims described only a few incidents. There were numerous occasions when he touched the victims. He took every chance he could to get more. As the victims got older and became bolder, he went to feeling and rubbing the girls under their clothes, and kissing them hard on the mouth and his penis became erect. He breathed heavily. He tried to dry hump Nicole. He was always calm and in control. The court was satisfied beyond areasonable doubt that both victims were assaulted by him on numerous occasion. The impact on their memory and ability to recall specific incidents is beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt. The cumulative effect of the abuse is severe and could stand out from other occurrences. The effects on the victims' memory are severe and the effects on their bodies and minds are cumulative. The onset of puberty means that there is a greater risk of physical or sexual assault. The symptoms of puberty are already manifest in the form of increased periods of sleep and increased exposure to alcohol. The effect of puberty on memory is that it can lead to changes in behaviour. As a result, the Court is satisfied that both young victims can't recall specific occurrences. There is no evidence of repeated acts of sexual abuse. The victim's memory is still young and cannot be expected to fill in the gaps."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The first mortgageee, who had been retained to act as general counsel, requested that the disbursements of the mortgage advances be postponed in order to allow for sufficient funds to be paid in due course. The second mortgageee and his predecessor, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and were withdrawing its support. In early 1987, the first mortgageeur, who was to advise the creditors that the project was still viable, requested to be disbursed $78,400 from the first two mortgage draws and that he was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the latter irrevocably letter. The third mortgagee requested that his fees be paid on the same time as the next mortgage advance. The plaintiff's claim was dismissed as there was no evidence of a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. The plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The evidence was extensive and there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have further information about. The accused had 55 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. He had shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason.  2) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code, along with the provisions of s.718.2 of the criminal code, states that a sentence of 6 years, 5 months to be served in a federal penitentiary is appropriate. The principles of sentencing, including the use of a weapon while prohibited by doing so, are applicable. The evidence showed that the accused had longstanding unresolved issues regarding his upbringing and was very resentful of his community. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 8 years was appropriate. A global sentence was appropriate in this case, with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of his sentence pursuant to ss.743.5(1) and (i)of the Code. There may be restorative programs available that could not be accessed if the Court made such an order. It was suggested that the Crown should allow the CSC to do their work without being impeded by the Court's arbitrary imposition of such a order that would result in the accused not being eligible for parole until he had served the full of his term."

Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the sole ground upon which the Information was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (2) no reliance could have been placed thereon in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused applies for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time.

The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June. 2) The amount of delay has not been determined. 3) The time between the charge to trial and the adjournment is approximately 9 months. 4) The delay is directly related to the accused not making sufficient disclosure. 5) The accused has suffered an unnecessary additional 9 months of unemployment, economic hardship and other prejudice in the form of embarrassment from the numerous media reports of the charges. The accused did not have to call evidence at the preliminary hearing. The judge must be satisfied that the accused and society in general have a similar interest in bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial.  6) The Court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the charge. 7) The prejudice has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay."

The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.

The accused states that in none of the cases cited by the accused was the same person who had been detained by the Canadian authorities for 5 years and had made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001. HELD: The accused's application is dismissed.  1) The Court found that the accused has met the low threshold for non-appearance that must be met in order to avoid extradition to Romania.  2) The accused has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. He is a Convention refugee. It is not the Court's place to look behind that status on an application of this nature. In fact, it is Romania's characterisation in light of the committal order, the sureties who are his common law spouse and member of the Romanian community in Saskatoon and the exhaustion of his appeal rights in Romania are important considerations in this case.

The applicant alleges the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr was responsible for his conduct. HELD: The application for leave was granted. The court found there may well be some delay by allowing the third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984. It can hardly be said any additional delay, due to thirdparty proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There was no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third party proceeding would result in the disappearance of any evidence or that extra costs will be incurred by the defendant in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's Claim. The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as a Third party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant. Unfortunately this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action brought in a former student at the school is different in nature. It may cover a different time period and/or employee so the extent of the thirdparty's involvement will vary from case to case. The liability of that third party will have to be determined on a case by case basis."

It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to order summary trial, or (c) the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one. 3) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. 4) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is genuine need for trial. Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.  5) The plaintiffs damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the Rules."
2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the vehicle struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing a parking lot when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with the complainant's vehicle. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether the accused has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. HELD: The officer was not injured. The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake pedal did not lock upon impact. The Crown's argument that the officer thought the vehicle could slow down and did not accelerate was not supported by the officer's own evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to the officer, locked upon striking the complainant and that distance was at most one foot. The Court was satisfied that the Crown had proved the offence was careless. 1) The officer did not err in asking the complainant if he needed an ambulance or an ambulance. He was in the middle of a cross-walk when the accident occurred. He must have thought that the vehicle was going very short distance forward before striking him. His evidence that the complainant raised an issue with him regarding the speed at which he was travelling was insufficient to conclude that he was going too fast. The defence suggested that the driver had an oblique motive for thinking that the respondent was being insolent and returning to set him straight. 2) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the police vehicle were careless. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to have stopped his vehicle. He could have reasonably concluded that the person he was attempting to assist was in need of assistance. 3) The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, driving past a stopped vehicle, asking if he required an ambulance, and driving forward into the complainant without any significant degree of force. The police officer who responded to the complaint was first asked if he had any time as he was on call and then whether he required ambulances. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test is whether the police officer exercised due due diligence or took reasonable care. The actions in this case were, firstly, his driving past the police car which was directly in front of the"
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred when the appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The appellant was awarded general liability and refused to defend the action on the basis of an exclusionary provision in its policy. The chambers judge found that although Royal had a duty to defend, it was not obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The issue to be resolved was whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the judge hearing the application may engage in, it does not matter that the inquiry is a complete analysis of the applicability of any relevant exclusion or definition provision in the insurance policy. 2)The chambers judge recognized that the question is arguable and should not be conclusive. It would be rare application for a directions which contain no arguable point. 3)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation of s. 209(2) and s.207(3) of the Act. However, the court was in as good a position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c) as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Nichols."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Charter and one count of conspiracy. The accused argued that the Provincial Court judge that authorized the interception had no basis to issue the telephone intercept authorization. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The learned judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue it. 1)The authorization to intercept private communications was validly obtained and executed in a bona fide way. 2)There was no Charter breach. 3)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. 4)The respondent consented to have her private communications with the accused intercepted in order to assist the police in the investigation of the offences outlined below. 5)The investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. 6)The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the respondent to speak. 7)The conversation was clearly intended to elicit responses from the accused. 8)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities. It concluded that there was no breach and the evidence was non-conscriptive. The respondent argued that because the offence was not specified in the authorization the evidence ought to be classified as conscriptive and ought not to be excluded. 9)The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach, and the effect of exclusion were all factors considered to be considered. 10)Even if there was a Charter breach the evidence is non-consecutive. It is not the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. 11)The appellant's argument that the respondent had sufficient evidence to issue an intercept authorization did not affect the admissibility of the evidence. 12)The affidavit was a transcript of the conversation. The transcript was an accurate transcription of the telephone conversation. 13)The accused argued the evidence should be excluded as there was insufficient evidence to do so.  14)Although the respondent was denied his right to choose his audience, the Court concluded that evidence obtained pursuant to a valid authorization for interception of private communications could be used in relation to an offence not specified therein. 15)The court reviewed the history of non-compliance with s.8 and determined the respondent's Charter rights had not been breached. 16)The application was dismissed with costs of costs of the application. 17)Costs of the trial."

e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

The defence sought to use her prior statement as substantive evidence. HELD: 1)The credibility of the witness was determined to be at the lower end of the test for reliability based on the evidence of the police officer who had administered a contemporaneous oath prior to the taking of the statement and in enough different particulars to be satisfied that her statement met the threshold of reliability. 2)Annette Cook's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its subjectents. It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence obtained with regard to the affidavit and the person who has provided the consistent testimony that the statements are unreliable. 3)The reliability threshold can be met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. 4)The evidence established that the witness, who is an unindicted co-conspirator in this matter and was charged with drug offences arising out of this same investigation, was properly restrained from uttering any swear words or statements as required by the Act. 5)The oath administered was not administered prior to her arrest and there was no warning provided at that time that the contents of her videotaped statement would be changed. 6)The affidavit was properly administered post-sentence. 7)The statements which were not demonstrably false and were not inconsistent with the truth were found to be unreliable. 8)The affidavits were properly prepared and the oath was properly delivered prior to their taking. 9)The validity of the statements was determined on the balance of probabilities. 10)The Court was satisfied that the reliability threshold was not met, even if the witness is sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it is subsequently known that at least a portion of her statement is false. 11)It was not possible for the Court to decide within appropriate time with appropriate instructions that the evidence be administered which would place the statement one step up from an unsworn statement. It was not the Court's position to decide whether the statements met that threshold."
