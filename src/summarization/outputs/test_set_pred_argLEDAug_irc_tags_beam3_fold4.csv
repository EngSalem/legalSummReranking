Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The sole ground upon which the Information was based was hearsay information from a confidential source and no details were provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable. 2)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. She was, at the time, living in the home of her mother and stepfather. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her parents. The Appeal Board quashed the applicant's application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of her application for municipal assistance. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as a discretionary right to assistance. The fact that the appellant was an expectant mother pending the birth of her first child did not disqualify her from receiving assistance."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. For the plaintiff, who was the joint chief legal counsel to the first two mortgagee and the project's creditors, the first principal mortgagee had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. He recommended that the first three mortgagee receive separate legal counsel, the architects and the contractors, as well as an apparently unacknowledged letter of direction providing for the payment of mortgage proceeds upon the signature of certain individuals only. The plaintiffs sued the defendant claiming that in early April, 1987, he disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocables letter; in early March, 1987 he was negligent in his written acknowledgement of the latter letter; he broke the undertaking contained in that letter. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The defendant was found to be a conscientious solicitor, always attempting to be in strict compliance with the terms of his retainer and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients. 2)There was no evidence of a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. 3)The plaintiffs had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants, having destroyed their files, the death of the plaintiff's mother and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years were partners in the practice of law. HELD: The application was dismissed but costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. FIAT: The applicants have a good deal of sympathy for the applicants in this case. The plaintiff has not explained why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel, except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. 2)There was a significant delay, which must be weighed against the applicants' interests. The applicant's decision to destroy their files was understandable but not without some merit. 3)The comments contained in Brosseau v. Children's Aid Society of Sudbury Inc. et al (1986) were repeated in C.P.C. (2d) 312. It repeats an earlier statement that infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. So, an infant should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him in the same action. 4)The applicants' decision to shred their files is understandable but is not based on merit. The decision does not recognize a contingent element that is involved in a situation such as this one."
1996canlii5602.txt,"The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom.. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The respondent was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The Crown sought to have the sentence retroactive to June 1995. The sentencing judge, however, disagreed with the Crown's argument that the sentence should be varied only if he was satisfied that it was clearly excessive or inadequate in relation to the offence proven or to the record of the accused. The trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this case."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.",The plaintiff and two juvenile offenders who had been charged with sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl at a roller skating rink had been practicing their newscast at the defendant's radio station early in the morning so as to report the news commencing with the six o'clock bulletin. The defendant refused to cooperate with the Commission's investigation and the matter was moved to trial. HELD: The plaintiff's cause of action was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant published the news that it received from the police. 2)It was always a proven reliable source of information. 3)The fact that the plaintiff's business had apparently suffered in the wake of the assault did not necessarily cast a negative nettle about the defendant. 4)The evidence was that the defendant was merely doing its job of reporting news; there was no way they knew or ought to have known that the information that were aired would cause harm to the plaintiff or to her business or to anybody else.
1997canlii786.txt,"The parties executed a separation agreement that resolved all matters corollary to their divorce and the Matrimonial Property Act. The respondent husband proceeded with an uncontested divorce. The appellant wife did not oppose the proceeding. She subsequently appealed the corollary relief judgment on the grounds that the underlying separation agreement is unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, one of which was in the joint custody of the parties. In 1996, the appellant moved into the basement of the matrimonial home with the respondent. She claimed that she was suffering from lingering depression and that she entered into an improvident separation agreement to alleviate the symptoms of her depression. The respondent opposed the separation agreement, arguing that it was unconscionable and unduly harsh. Allowing the application to admit fresh evidence, that the appellant had not met the test for the admission of fresh evidence and that, in the circumstances, it was unnecessary to consider whether or not she has a strong prima facie case that the agreement is unconscionsable."
1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands. Some of the evidence conflicted. Viva voce evidence should be heard.,"The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land titles Act S.S. c. L-5 and s.56 of The Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act (EMOA) for an order relieving the respondent Estate (the deceased) from payment of a maintenance order by Johnson J.(as he then was) on November 28, 1972. The decree gave the deceased custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The applicant claimed she received welfare to support herself and the children until 1981. During these years she had no funds with which to hire a lawyer to enforce the support payments which were due to her. HELD: The application failed. The respondent was not mislead and has not been prejudice.  1)The applicant was nether the executrix named in the Will and received $40 per month in arrears of support. She presented no evidence of the transfer of the land to her, there was no consideration being paid nor was there evidence of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  2)The respondent was entitled to recover arrear of maintenance pursuant to the 1972 order.  3)The application failed to be determined upon s.57 of the EMOA. The question for resolution in whether it would in the words of the section be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned was not one which the trial judge should determine."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code.

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action. The issues raised in the application were complicated and not at all clear in their implications. The jury may be advised of the prior accident, the date of the accident, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and that the accidentultimately was settled, and the action discontinued. The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and the costs of the application. HELD: The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the claim. The release completed by her was part and parcel of that settlement. Beyond the issue of privilege, the more critical problem is revisiting the action which is a series of allegations made by the respondent against the prior defendant."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the home. HELD: The respondent was granted exclusive possession. 1)No caselaw in support of the position of either party could be found. The issue resolved around the interpretation of two paragraphs of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules which provide: '15(1) unless otherwise ordered by the judge appealed from or by judge, the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of any judgment or order pending the disposition of the appeal.' 2)The Court was therefore bound by Rule 15. All applications to the Court should be directed to the counsel of the petitioner and all directions to the applicant to make in the reasonable time period to avoid the potential of the respondent having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter."
1999skqb17.txt,"The plaintiff alleged he was sexually assaulted and that Attorney General of Canada as employer of the administrator of the residential school was also responsible. The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The applicant requires leave of this Court under s. 7 of The Contributory Negligence Act, R.S. S. 1978, c. C-31, and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. It applies to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. The applicant alleges the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr was responsible for his conduct. HELD: The application for leave was granted. The court found there must be some material by which a prima facie claim is shown, the proposed third party claim and the pleadings on file could well be sufficient for this purpose. There may well be some delay by allowing third party proceedings but it will not be inordinate. Pre-trial proceedings must be ordered by consent of the parties. The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984. It can hardly be said any additional delay, due to thirdparty proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. There is no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third-party proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's Claim.  1) The applicant has not established any pre-existing prejudice. The pre-trial process was a procedural process. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as third party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to the applicant. Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action brings by a former student at a residential school is different in nature. It may cover a different time period and/or employee so that the extent of the third party's involvement will vary from case to case. The second party's liability will have to be determined on a case by case basis."
2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused made an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) had be infringed. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer.  1) The Court was not in error in that finding. The continued detention on his own initiative constituted a 'de facto' arrest. 2) There was no suggestion in the evidence before the accused that he misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the unjust arrest. In the present case, the accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel but he had the opportunity to consult counsel and the warning. He gave a statement to the police."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on this stretch of road for a short period of time, a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The driving must constitute a departure from that of reasonably prudent person. The mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct."

The Union opposed all of the applications advanced by the Union, claiming that they were an attempt by the Court to interfere with the Union's right to proceed as sole defendant in a labour dispute. The Court dismissed the application as not having jurisdiction to hear the application. Application to be joined by an amicus curiae or intervener was dismissed for the reasons set forth by Justice Tidman in Johnston et al. [1989] 73 N.B.R. (2d) 219 (C.A.). The Union did not have the status to file an appeal unless it was first joined in either of the two capacities as a result of the recent applications before the Court of Appeal. There were no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to proceeding as defendant, or as an Intended Defendant pursuant to Rule 5.06. The cases arising under this section are usually concerned with an applicant by an existing plaintiff to add an additional party as plaintiff, or alternatively as a defendant within the meaning of s. 44(1)(b) of the Judicature Act, which incorporated the ancient practice of the Chancery in England. In this case, the Union was not joined by a party or as intervener under Rule 7 nor was it a party to the action. The only notice of appeal available was made to the Court on October 1st, 1999. In that case, notice of an application was served on the Union by counsel for the Union and no one appeared on behalf of that Union at the hearing on the application date. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the union in the amount of $10,000. The court reviewed the history of the interlocutory proceedings and determined that the Court has jurisdiction to consider an application of an interim injunction prohibiting an individual (unnamed persons) for the balance of the work on a proposed project without compliance with the collective agreement. There are no precedents or precedents for this type of proceeding."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in the mother's name to the plaintiff and two other children, Bruce and Wanda. After Mabel died in March 1998, the plaintiff, as litigation guardian of the four granddaughters, alleged that she had given the plaintiff written instructions to prepare four cheques in the amount of $5,000 for each grandchild. The plaintiff, who had been hospitalized, requested that the three cheques be endorsed by the plaintiff in 1992 for the benefit of his four children; in 1995, Wanda's name was added to the account as joint owner. In 1998, Mabel's cancer was terminal. She died on March 24, 1998 at which time there was still $25,000 in the bank account in the joint names of the plaintiff's wife and the mother of the children. HELD: The written instructions were never provided to the defendant. The defendant became the sole trustee for the four grandchildren of his estate.  1)An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2)An individual is not an employee of a corporation. A volunteer will not assist in the creation of an equity in the favour of the corporation. 3)In the case of McIntyre v. Royal Trust Company, 1946 CanLII 249, the court was satisfied that the instructions were given to the mother in 1992. The following Sunday, Pennefather died, before Royal Trust company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. 4)The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $10,000.00. 5)Costs of the judgment were not necessary to take into account the fact that the plaintiff was a party to the conspiracy and the conspiracy did not justify the appointment of an individual as trustee. 6)Any costs of the action were to be withdrawn on the basis of insufficient evidence."
2_2000skqb53.txt,"An appeal from Provincial Court on a Small Claim. The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","An appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. The question of whether something that is affixed to realty is a fixture that passes with title to the realty. A wheelchair lift loaned to the defendants by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for use of their disabled foster child had ceased to operate a few months after the defendants acquired the house property. The plaintiff and her husband sold the property to the respondent, Elsa San Diego. The vendors advertised the property as being good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. When selling the property, the vendors made no mention to the purchaser, the respondent San Diego, about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The trial judge did not accept Kapronczai's denial that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair lifted was not part of the Realty or was owned by the Abilities Council. There was evidence on which the trial judge could find as he did. HELD: The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party. It was not the intention of either party that something was affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of a realty nor was it a finding of the Provincial Court Judge that the manner of a finding in Small Claims Court showed that the lessee had nothing to do with the application of the purchase money or the notice on the title, or risk losing it at least as against Tania and Kaproczai who had knowledge of facts according to the judge. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which, in my view, gives San Diego a claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the provincial court judge. In the circumstances, the appeal is dismissed both in the plaintiff's favor and that of third party, the Jabours."
2_2002nspc20.txt,"The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees. A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS). The Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(1) of the Income tax Act, ordering him to make payment of the sum of $22,069.23 to the receiver. HELD: The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HMPS and it was the Crown's position that they listed on the Assignment made to creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings, liabilities of $250,056 and interest of $25,000 that were paid to HMPS. The Crown had not established the existence of the matters set out in s.232 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Court concluded that a subsection 238(2) compliance order falls within the definition of 'any fine, penalty, restitution order or other order similar in nature to a fine or penalty order imposed by a Court in respect of an offence...' as set out by s.178(1)(a). Such matters were unaffected by the bankruptcy proceeding and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. The HMPS employee was an officer and director at all times material to these offences. He operated the company with another unnamed investor and was relying upon an investor and the accountant to meet the requirements of the income tax Act including the remittance to receiver. HMPS listed Canada Customs and Revenue Agency as one of its creditors and included therein the amount of indebtedness to HMTS as part of the indebtedness that was owed to HMSS. In the course of assessing the ability to pay by the accused, the Court must infer from the pleadings that either of these individuals were at least equally, if not more, responsible for the offences."

The accused asked the court to reconsider its decision to quash a subpoena issued to the former Superintendent of Bankruptcy on the basis of testimony presented from other witnesses after the subpoena was quashed. Application dismissed; the accused had not met the onus on the balance of probabilities of establishing that the former Superintendent had relevant or material evidence to offer concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The subsequent testimony and documentation did not support the accused's allegations concerning the former Superintendent's motives or conduct.","The defendant was charged with three counts of fraud contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code relating to his activities as president and principal shareholder of a bankrupt corporation. The defendant brought motions (the Charter Motions) seeking a stay of those charges on the basis his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the RCMP during investigations of his activities and of the administration of the bankrupt corporation, and by the R.C.M.P. during his tenure as Superintendent. After the Subpoena was quashed, the defendant presented additional testimony from RCMP officers and evidence from a senior officer who was senior official in the Halifax Police Office during Mr. Redling's tenure. Mr. Black now suggests that the evidence which those witnesses gave and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the defendant's attendance. Application is dismissed; the defendant has not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that he has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the charter motions. The testimony and documentation presented at the hearings do not provide any basis to compel his attendance. There is no basis to find that the defendant is likely to provide any additional information concerning that issue."
2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant proposed to fix costs in the amount of $15,000 plus disbursements. Costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Costs awarded on the amount involved under Tariff A.  The conduct of any party which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding was also factors that the court may consider. It would cost the plaintiffs $21,663.48 in legal fees to recover $29,150."
2_2005nssc84.txt,"The court had previously ordered interim joint custody of the child, with the primary residence being with the mother. The mother later unilaterally moved from Bridgewater to Halifax, frustrating the access provisions of the interim order. The father applied for interim custody and the mother replied, seeking sole custody. Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in May 2005, applied to vary the existing order. The application was held before Justice Dellapinna of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal and the parties were ordered to share joint custody of the children, with the primary residence to be in the municipality. The respondent determined that it was in the children's best interests to remain in the mother's care beyond the end of the school year. The children's extracurricular activities were to be suspended during two weeks of block holiday time (see: 2005). The respondent significantly altered the child's ability to be involved with the care of their children. HELD: The children were in the custody of their father until further court order of the Court. 1) The respondent unilaterally moved the children from their school and after school care in Halifax to Bridgewater, one hour from Halifax, changed their school, changed the primary residences and had access only on the second weekend in the new location. 2) The Court varied the existing Order for child support payable by the respondent to reflect his current income. 3) It was not in the parties' best interests for the children to be placed in the primary care of the father at this time. It was in their best interests not to return to the traditional school year in which they had been accustomed. 4) The parties had made a unilateral decision that significantly disrupted the quantity, quality and quality of the relationship that the father had with the children with them. The Court found that the respondent had done so in the face of an existing Court order. It is not in their interests to stay in the current school year where they have been accustomed to living in the same area. 5) The court found that in the circumstances the respondent has unilaterally taken steps that significantly disrupt not only the quantity but the quality of a relationship that was already established between the parties."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he then showed, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the amount of damage caused to the vehicle, and the manner in which he backed up to speak with the driver. The issues were whether the Crown had proved that the accused drove without due consideration and attention applying the objective test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Kozun 1997 CanLII 11313 and whether the officer applied due diligence by taking appropriate steps to avoid the particular event. HELD: The officer was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the vehicle move forward was accepted. The officer applied his brake when he saw the accused and immediately took steps both to assist the accused by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene. This officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the accused. 2) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside the police vehicle were careless. He could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him and that the driving was careless. 3) The police officer did everything within his power to assist, including by asking the accused if he needed an ambulance or an ambulance. He did not swear at the officer and did not object to his assistance. In fact, he may have been more likely to have asked the officer to back up and speak with him. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench judge was satisfied that the officer's action in the parking lot was careless and that he could have reasonably expected the accused to swear at him and cause him to be fired from his employment. The Court did not find any significance in which of the two individuals, if any, would provide their names."

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertaking given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she was not impaired by alcohol at the time she made the demand. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would 'kick in' and she wasn't really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. The certificate of analysis was not admissible because the breathalyzer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand as there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 am. to justify the breath demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by Alcohol.

2_2007skqb337.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of dangerous driving. The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

HELD: Conviction set aside; conviction set aside with appeal allowed. 1) There was no rational conclusion from which the trial judge could have concluded Fleury was travelling at a high speed across the four lanes of traffic without stopping at the stop sign. The evidence from the scene of the accident was all that could have been concluded to be rational. However, without the expert evidence available to conclude that Fleury could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he told the judge, it seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without the assistance of an expert. 2) The appeal was allowed.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and with intent to commit an indictable offence, having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were in custody for more than 10 months at the time of their appeal. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal gave each of them two credit for time served on remand which was 20 months. The sentence which each of the accused will serve from this date is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. 2) Taking into account their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued within the City of Regina, and the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery, these sentences are appropriate in the circumstances. 3) The sentences are based on the principles outlined in s. 718 of the Code. The offences were committed against a person in a vulnerable position. Attendants of all-night convenience store robberies work evening and night-time shifts, often at little more than minimum wage. They are often required to work alone or with only one other co-worker. These are all factors which militate against the accuseds' use of violence. 4) The accused's criminal record consists of two robbery with violence convictions and one charge of taking motor vehicle without the owner's consent. One of these offences was committed against the clerk behind the counter. The other was committed when they were youth."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the sellers did not disclose that the place had flooded in the past. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. This was a minor problem and the sellers failed to disclose it to the public. The claimant alleged there had been repeated repeated breaches of the property's condition. The defendant argued the sufficiency of evidence was a question of law, not of convenience. The court dismissed the motion for non-suit, finding that the claims were not supported by the evidence. Dismissing the motion, that the statements made by the vendors are merely meant to clarify the right of defence counsel to move for dismissal at the end of a plaintiff's case without electing whether or not to call evidence. There is no need to impose fines or fees on vendors who fail to disclose their knowledge of the state of the premises. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. It is necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law. This is particularly true in a case such as this where a claim for damages filed by a self-represented plaintiff against a defendant who is represented by a Counsel does not have a prima facie case and is not being induced by the law to do so."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment as well as the sentence imposed because the questions and the appellant's responses were relatively innocuous and did not play major role in the evidence of the appellant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2) In all of the circumstances of this case the appellant was prejudiced by the questions. His evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath was not objected to when it occurred. In the context of the entire cross-examination, these questions and his responses were in no way an issue on the trial."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. The defendant was found not guilty of the charge. On all of the evidence, he was convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and was not left in doubt by it. All of the indicia of hunting at night with the searchlight are present in this case. It cannot escape notice that there were two loaded firearms in the vehicle; cannot accept that the rifle that was in the back seat was loaded with four live rounds; there was no oversight by the defendant's companions, and him, in ensuring that the firearms were unloaded at the time he picked them up. There were some uncontroverted facts, all of which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the defendant was employing the search light for the purposes of hunting wildlife."
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60. The salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects in these circumstances because the public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. The court has supervisory and protecting power over its own records. Little that is filed in the Family Division is filed voluntarily. Most of the material in the file must be filed by the rules of court and, on occasion, court order. This requires a public interest and social interest imbedded in the expectation of privacy and confidentiality for personal identifiers and the risk of identity theft is real. There must be a social value or public interest of superordinate importance in order to prevent identity theft, and the public has not been denied that right."
3_1994canlii4234.txt,"The appellant appealed a decision of the trial judge declaring a mistrial in his summary offence trial and setting a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record.  He argued the judge erred by not ordering a stay of proceedings and/or a dismissal at the beginning of the trial, and by failing to find the non-disclosure violated his rights under s. 11(d) of the Charter. He sought a stay of proceedings in this action. Dismissing the appeal, that a declaration is not an 'order' under s. 813(a)(i) of the Code in that it does not bring a final end to the matter. It is therefore not appealable.","This was an appeal from a decision wherein the trial judge declared a mistrial and set a new date for trial because the Crown had not disclosed a police record that contained the individual weighing of each set of wheels on the accused tandem axle truck. The appellant argued that a declaration of mistrial on a summary conviction charge was an order under s. 813(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, from which the accused could Appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that an order such as this one cannot lie behind an order of this nature. An order under this section of the Code must be final in the sense that it brings to an end a particular proceeding, rather than a final determination."

3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected.

An order for costs was ordered. 1)The Act does not authorize the the appointment of the public trustee as a litigation guardian on behalf of H.B. However that becomes more evident when s32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult adults. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act. 2)The public trustee best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v.

3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. In 1989 the plaintiff bid on and obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previously planned international calibre soccer and soccer field which had been abandoned by the city. Shortly after commencing the work, the city hired the plaintiff again.

It was possible to have the entire allegations heard at one trial, or at the very least it should have been attempted. 2)The parties had spent significant time and money trying to establish the facts contained in the first statement of claim. The denial of any opportunity for the plaintiff to attempt to have all the allegations heard by the City was serious prejudice. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same factual cause of action. 3)The doctrine of 'issue estoppel' applied to the application. 4)Costs of the application were awarded to the plaintiff."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge at the hearing of the appeal decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute with the parties. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the issues between them. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines was set aside. The appeal was dismissed. 1) The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s7(1(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1) as he believed the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of these children's parents. 2) There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can not see that the appellant was deprived of the right of lead evidence on any relevant issue and we must accordingly find that the judge made no error in that decision."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over the legal limit contrary to ss.255(b) and ss.253(a). The police testified at trial that they followed the accused into service station at 8:20 p.m. and observed they displayed an out of date sticker on its licence plate in violation of s. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The officer engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. The accused nearly fell over when he exited. The police officer concluded that the accused's ability to operate the vehicle was impaired and arrested him at 11:50 pm. The Court reviewed the various schemes and object of the police force and concluded that they operate to render the police officers part of 'police force for every part of Canada' and that the Crown has established beyond any reasonable doubt both offences charged. The Police Act must be read in a manner in which the legislature is not taken to have exceeded it's jurisdiction; the words must be clear and unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law; meaning that appears to be the most reasonable may be selected."

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in December 26, 1997. Each has significant assets at the time of the marriage which have increased in value since that date. They agreed in their wills that after their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1) The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: one-half of the Value of the Melville residence owned by the petitioner prior to the marriage (which had value of $30,000.00) leaving all of their assets to the respective children; and half of each party's share of vacation costs.  2) There was no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. 3) The parties' verbal agreement that they would separate their assets from one another led them to conclude they had paid practically all of the distribution weight to each other's assets prior to marriage which was practically bound by the verbal agreement they had made at that time. The verbal agreement between them was not binding and they paid no consideration at all to the distribution of assets by way of a verbal agreement."

The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","An appeal of the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had been served with hearing notice. Prior to the hearing he was given written particulars of his expanded claim for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and that when he attended for the hearing before the landlord he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. Further, he argued he was unaware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The notice given to the tenant was inadequate to support the claim based on all the evidence and came to a conclusion that was not patently unreasonable given that evidence. 2)The rental policy was not breached because the notice was given to all the tenants requesting further information was inadequate. 3)The rentalsman reached a decision based on evidence not supported by the facts.

3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","W.R.T.

The applicant company and its creditor accepted that the terms of the indemnity set out in the Proposal with respect to present and past officers and directors was too widely cast and inappropriate. The proponents are in agreement with the first ground of the creditor's objection that the pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecured creditors who had been represented by the applicant and preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. Accordingly the proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposal is consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) of the Act and it is ordered accordingly. Taking into account the interests of the debtor (to give him an opportunity to meet with his creditors and to find a way of producing assets or revenue which will provide them with a dividend outside of bankruptcy), the general body of creditors (to protect creditors generally by insuring that what is put up by way of proposal is a reasonable one), and the public-at-large in maintaining the integrity of bankruptcy legislation (including considering whether or not the proposal complies with standards of commercial morality), the court concluded that the applicant's proposal did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court."
3_2004skca49.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order. [3] The appeal is allowed and the decision of the chambers judge is set aside.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. The consent judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At issue was whether there should be variation of the custody order and child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. Nothing had changed to warrant a variation. The material change threshold has not been met. The applicant should be alive to the fact that Letitia deserves significant amounts of time to pursue her own interests, activities and independence. It is clear that her best interests require that the status quo be continued. 1) The fact that the respondent failed to file any income tax returns, notices of assessment or re-assessment in support of his application did not disqualify him from reapplying for variation.  2) There was no evidence of a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant variation in child support or arrears. 3) The respondent was, as of August 2003, 10 months in arrearars of child support and no costs awarded. 4) The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute a material change of circumstance relevant to custody. The present application is dismissed."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, now plead guilty to three counts of breaking and entering. The charge of being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused was sentenced to three years imprisonment along with a fine of $10,000 and was given credit for time in custody. The Crown withdrew action on the remaining counts other than those in the indictment. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in federal custody, followed by a period of six years incarceration. The aggravating circumstances of the offences and the fact that the accused had less than perfect upbringing and co-operated fully with the police, including testifying at the trial of his co-accused. The accused is 23 years old and has a Grade X education. He has had sporadic employment over his adult years. The Court found that the offences were relatively minor property offences and that the aggravating factors in this case were the accused's age, education, work ethic, and willingness to cooperate with police."

The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The accused was charged with an armed robbery. The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The letter was not an alibi. It was an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate a alibi by perjury. 2)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary, preliminary, and trial (eleven months after the robbery) was not a reason to suspect or reject his evidence that he identified the accused in the photo ID line-up but was a reasonable person to suspect that he was not at the club at the time of the robbery. 3)There was no other explanation for the request for the false evidence to be given. 4)The defence had no reasonable doubt that the motorcyclist on the second occasion and the person reported to the police at the station were the same person the accused."

He questioned the validity of service by mail arguing personal service was required. HELD: Whether the appellant was validly served is an issue that will properly presented to and determined by the Court hearing the appeal. Bringing an application under Queen's Bench Rule 271 would have been a more expeditious procedure. The stay was granted since this was the type of appeal that can be expedited. The monies paid into court will remain in Court pending the hearing and determination of the appeal. Costs were reserved to the Court hearing the appeal.,The appellant appealed an order in Queen's Bench granting him child support. He argued that personal service was required. He also questioned the validity of service by mail. The Queen'sBench file indicates that the application was served by mail addressed to his home address an address which he designated as his address for service upon electing to represent himself. HELD: The appeal was granted. The appellant was allowed to file an affidavit of eligibility and pay child support in the amount of $633 per month. He was directed to pay 79% of the following Section 7 expenses which were found to be necessary and reasonable.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of the applicant. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The applicant is entitled to rely on the allegations made in the pleadings filed against it. It must look beyond the choice of labels, and examine the substance of the allegations contained therein. This does not involve deciding whether the claims have any merit. It is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt that the duty to defend is to be resolved. 2) The liability for compensatory damages is limited as described in section III of the Soverign Policy. 3) The application for an exclusion of liability for 'bodily injury or property damage' which occurs during the policy period is a three step process. The applicant cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 4) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant, and the applicant must be aware of the possible outcomes of the litigation. Whether any of the properly pleaded, non-derivative claims could potentially trigger an indemnity is a third step. The insurer is only entitled to defend if there is a genuine risk that the claim falls within its coverage. 5) There is no evidence to support the allegation that the claims fall within the coverage provided. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of a contract is of no moment. The negligent misrepresentation of the claim by the plaintiff in this case does not change the fact that it is a false allegation. The fact that the defendant sub-contracted with the plaintiff to build the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit does not mean that the insurer is obliged to defend. Rather, it is only a fanciful reading of the statement of claim to determine the true nature of its claim. 6) The defendant was negligent and breached the contractual and other duties owed by it. The defendant is also entitled to costs."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listened to defendant's counsel and read the material attached to his lawyer's affidavit, there were significant other factors affecting the plaintiff's health. The defendant argued there should be an 'air of realty' to her argument as she had not been able to establish that the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The court granted the appeal and set aside the order of the trial judge. It is not the function of the court in determining the matter of an interim judgment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. A summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the father was to pay monthly spousal and child support of $2,000. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous amount; the father took responsibility for $9,000 in arrears; and for the cost of the children's education, which was not part of the agreement. The mother alleged that she had no difficulty continuing in future to pay the costs of his children's post-secondary pursuits. She claimed that she owed $52,000 to the father. Monthly expenditures of $1,836 were not reliable. Her calculation of arrear under the old order was not reliable, there were gaps in her records and her memory was mostly speculative. She believed she received 40-41% of her income from the mother's care and that the father had no part in this agreement. She alleged she received no money in September and October 2005, when her children left her care and moved to live with her father and his spouse in Halifax. In August 2005, the father stopped paying support. He requested enforcement of the amount in the original order and she received $10,000 directly. She also claimed she had been misled by the father as to her income and claimed she was entitled to receive $50,000 less child and Spousal support than she was actually retaining. The oral agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and by the parties. The amount due under their varied agreement would be $51,000 and that is what his records show he paid directly. In the absence of any evidence that the mother had any difficulty in obtaining support, the court could not determine the amount owing. The parties had entered into a standard variation clause in the Separation Agreement in 2003 and the payments to Maintenance Enforcement were in place until August 2005. In January 2006 the father ceased paying support pursuant to the old Corollary Relief Judgment and Maintenance Enforcement issued a garnishee in the amount of $29,672. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in the range of $12,500. The court ordered that the payments be reduced to $2 per month and that maintenance enforcement be responsible for the balance of the payments payable to the applicant. The applicant was ordered to pay back any outstanding maintenance owed by the"
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and seek an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The defendants then applied to amend the order to add the plaintiff as a plaintiff and amendment the statement of claim. The second application was granted in part. The court reviewed the relevant case law and adopted the test used in Duke v. Vervaeck, 2013 SKQB 591(CanLII), 138 Sask 277. HELD: 1) The preservation order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules s. 20(a) and s. 7(2). The court found that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. 2) The defendants chose to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It is their position that this action is 'totally independent' from the Turks Proceedings and that even if there is some logic in securing the Turkish judgment before dealing with enforcement, that approach became unacceptable once the impact of the Order was in place. The addition of the plaintiff would not create a wholly new proceeding."
5_1994canlii4347.txt,"The plaintiff was found to be two-thirds and the defendant one-third responsible for an accident which occurred when the defendant's car hit the plaintiff as she tried to cross the highway on her bicycle. The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds responsible for the injuries suffered when the defendant's vehicle struck her while she was attempting to cross the No. Highway. Damage was determined at $1,255.25. The defendant agreed to apportion responsibility for $50,000 of this amount on a Tariff A scale and fixed the amount at $25,000.00. Prior to trial, the plaintiff filed an offer to sell in excess of five years following the accident and was withdrawn. Counsel advised that they had been unable to agree on any issues concerning interest and costs. Grant suggested that Civil Procedure Rule 41A.09 should be applied because of the 3.5 years delay between the accident date and the date of trial. Equalization payments of 2.5 percent per annum would be appropriate. To reduce the amount Involved would create a double reduction in the costs to which the plaintiff is entitled and would be unfair to the plaintiff."

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed.  1) The Crown cannot deny that the applicant reasonably expected that the Crown would carefully consider those findings and reassess its position in relation to this accused in light of the decision of the trial judge in Schafer. The Crown, in its approach, preferred to proceed with the trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial.  2) In light of a number of recent decisions the Crown has made it clear that it is not bound by any of the findings of the Court in the original indictment. 3) In some cases the Crown frankly concedes that the conclusions of Klebuc J. would also, if accepted, exonerate the accused. However, once particulars were supplied, the Crown could consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590, if the accused could show, for example, that it would be prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor-trailer unit travelling in an easterly direction. The officer noted that the unit was overweight and asked the accused if it was a regulation under the terms of the previous order. The RCMP did not issue a Notice of the Order nor had it been established that the document filed in court was proof of the order itself. HELD: The correct way to look at the admissibility of a Minister's order is through the use of signs. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality were sufficient to satisfy the requirement of a statutory officer, the order was not a regulation. The issuing authority was the municipality. Traffic signs were in place along a public highway leading to and from the provincial capital and to various other locations along the grid roads. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily or in any other media. The Department of Highways had erected several signs warning and advising of weight restrictions. Some of the signs were located along a rural highway leading into and around the capital city. The municipality had taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in that were in the business of hauling. No other notice was given."

There are two bases on which the applicant may add her as party for the purposes of appealing. The first is that the Chambers judge has jurisdiction to deal with the application and the second is whether the judge in Chambers has jurisdiction. The Chambers judge's authority depends on an express or implied grant of power in a rule or enactment and not on analogy. The jurisdiction of a Chambers judge depends on the distinction between matters of procedure and matters of substance. Even if he or she had jurisdiction, there is nothing in the material filed that would persuade him to make an order. The second is that there are a number of issues of fact surrounding the applicant's involvement with the child and the proceedings as well as the Society's communications with her.

Spousal Support was to be increased to $1,000 and the wife will have costs fixed in the amount of $ 1,000. 1)The only material change was the wife's means and needs were the fact she was residing with a New Partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. The benefits inherent in a shared living arrangement are not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the presentation of the wife; the bonuses are paid from the corporation's current income or from the prior year's income (the husband's argument) and certain of his expenses for travel and auto expenses are now paid by the company. 2)An increase is warranted in the circumstances but not necessary to offer hearsay evidence such as 'our accountant calculates the company's bottom line has declined by 62% from between the year 2000 and the year end 2001'. The restrictions on withdrawal must be objectively justified as legitimate, reasonable business purpose or an unavoidable contractual requirement. The bank's restrictions are not specified. 3)Costs fixed to the wife were fixed at $1."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, C.L.1 (""LTA""), and in particular s. 54 of that Act. HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the respondent's interest was an unregistered interest but it did confer rights on the appellant pursuant to the terms of the LTA. 2) The respondent was granted a mortgage of a limited interest, viz., a mortgage that the appellant would obtain a security interest in priority to the respondent by virtue of the filing of a caveat. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain an interest in a priority to thatof the respondent3) The LTA does not prevent or preclude the parties contracting to change the statutory order of priorities between themselves. Postponements of mortgages (i.e. subordination of one security to another) are common in commercial practice and effectively alter the priorities between the parties that would otherwise pertain under the applicable registration system. In this case the appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions. 4) The Supreme Court disagreed on the following analysis."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his s. 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of his belief in his obligation to report the accident. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from the trial on the basis that they were made with the intention of making a statement under s. 24(2) of the Charter. If the accused believed he was reporting the accident and believed that he was obliged to report it promptly, then the admission would render the trial unfair. The statements were made only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so. The admission of these statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer.  1) The defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by a breach of the accused's s.7 rights and were self- incriminating, the exclusion of those statements would leave him with nothing to rely on but the police could not rely on that information to make the demand.  2) The Crown conceded that the accused had a right to report an accident and reported it promptly. However, the evidence obtained after the arrest, especially after the drinking and driving, was not admissible. 3) The statements made to the officer following up on those excluded statements were not really made with a real intention to make a statement but were made in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. None of the statements were real or relevant to the trial and were not inadmissible. 4) The evidence obtained, the statements in particular were self incriminating and conscriptive. There was nothing dire about the accused making these statements while he was in hospital but nothing dire in the circumstances of this case. The arrest was illegal and the arrest was therefore illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely upon that information. 5) The officer was acting in good faith. He did not know the accused was only saying things because he felt he had to under compulsion of statute. Constable McGunigal was not acting with a serious disregard of his accused's rights nor was he taking statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He was interrogating the accused after he had arrested him, explained what he was arrested for, explained to him his rights"
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The claim was based on a simple contract debt and not specialty debt and was subject to the appropriate limitation period. The Respondent did not proceed with its common law action under the Alberta judgment. The matter proceeded by way of argument. The parties agreed the issues on appeal were matters of law and the Standard of Review was correctness. The issue was whether Section 9 of the Act could be interpreted to include claims arising out of a foreign judgment. Rather than determine a claim based upon a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court."
5_2008skqb210.txt,"Applicant seeks an order for an assessment of his legal bill. A Registrar may assess any bill for legal services, provided that the application is filed within 30 days or more if a judge makes a discretionary order to extend the period for assessment if it is in the interests of justice to do so. The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","The applicant seeks an order pursuant to s. 67(1) of The Legal Profession Act for an assessment of his legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent. HELD: The application is dismissed. The court is not satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to abridge the time and order the assessment. The evidence before the court is that the Back-Track matter and the BASF matter were separate actions. The last bill was not given to the respondent until after July 16, 2007. There were discussions between the respondent and the applicant concerning the appropriateness of the account at the time the account was rendered and for a period of time thereafter. Neither party has alleged or established that any prejudice would result from the abridgement of time. The Court is satisfied that the bill rendered by the applicant in this case is not a final bill.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; the appellant pulled over for a roadside warning and there was an odour of alcohol on her breath. The appellant contends that the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with the Prosper warning resulted in a violation of her rights. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. On the whole of the evidence, there was sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is one of correctness and the appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision, even if it reflects a palpable and overriding error. 1) Contrary to popular belief, the police officer has reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample. The police officer is only required to believe that the accused has committed an offence and objectively there must be reasonable grounds for that belief. 2) On the factual and legal grounds, the waiver must be free and voluntary and must not be the product of either direct or indirect compulsion. 3) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 4) The appellant's position that she did not require assistance for her to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser is not supported by the evidence. The officer was not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment. 5) There was no palpable or overriding error in the field of field tests conducted.  6) The officer's failure to include the respondent's telephone number in his field notes was not a material error. 7) The respondent had four and one half years' experience."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: A formal judgment was issued in 2012 and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a 'voice of the child report' be prepared in order to ascertain the respondent's best interests and gain a clarity of V.'s best interests by having the report prepared. Pursuant to court order, this matter arises following a trial in 2012 wherein Justice Kraus found that shared parenting regarding V.M., born March 8, 2005, should occur on a one week rotation basis (2012 SKQB 130 (CanLII), 395 Sask R 165). Formal issuance of the order slipped through the cracks and thus no judgment was ever taken out. The application now brought by the self-represented plaintiff is to have formal judgment issued and vary that decision in favor of her being the primary residence and that a 'voiced of child' report be prepared for the purposes of this application.  1) The affidavit evidence filed by the mother and father make it clear that Julie's views are not being reliably communicated to the court. 2) An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there a resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the court in deciding the custody and access plan that is in the best interests of V. 3) The affidavits are conflicting in nature and it is appropriate to ascertain that the appropriate order at this time is the commissioning of the Voice of Child report. If so, it ought to then be undertaken prior to ruling on the variation application. The variation is dependent on the report. 4) The parents are significantly strapped financially and as such declined to make an order for the costs of the report to them. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. Both parties agreed that the requirement of writing under the Statute of Frauds was an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiff states that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated via telephone. The defendant states that after the bidding process closed, the plaintiff agreed to sell the land to the highest bidder respecting the Unsold Quarter. The issue was whether the agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Act have been satisfied. 2) By inquiring into the words used by the defendant and the context in which those words were used, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. What may have been meant by Mr. Ziola's question and Mr. Petrie's answer regarding the subject quarters and the offer respecting the Adjacent Quarters is irrelevant.  3) The defendant must prove that he and the plaintiff exchanged information about the offer and the content of the telephone conversations between them.  4) The court accepts that the defendant is truthful and credible. The court is unwilling to ascribe dishonesty, complacency or frailty to the relationship between the parties. The relationship was not created solely as a result of the defendant's repeated assurances that he would not accept the plaintiff's bid for the land but through his repeated assurances to the plaintiff that he had received better offers than the plaintiff had. It is only through these assurances that the court will be able to conclude that the parties were in agreement that the Court can conclude that a contractual relationship was created.  5) The parties must establish that the plaintiff is entitled to rely upon the evidence of his or her testimony. The Court accepts that both parties were truthful, credible witnesses and that their testimony and the manner in which they expressed their opinion was sufficient to warrant an award of damages."
6_1992canlii4811.txt,"During a hearing involving an application for custody contested by three parties, the trial judge heard only the appellants' evidence and the direct examination of the natural mother before calling counsel to his chambers and advising them that the hearing was a waste of time and custody should be granted to the natural mother.

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed.

In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant had since gone into bankruptcy.

The appeal was allowed and the two restrictions placed in the order of the Chamber judge respecting the books or records relating to Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel ""Lady Marion II"" were deleted.

6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.  1)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and has been working hard and trying to make small payment toward his obligations. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge. 2)While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to the bankrupt's low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future."

The applicant's materials are deficient. Several necessary documents must be filed. In addition, the Farm Land Security Board has not completed its mandatory tasks under the Act. HELD: Application adjourned and leave is given to each party to file further materials. The Farm Land Security Board is requested to provide its report to the Court. Ordinarily, the deficiency in the applicant's motion might merit dismissal, but the Act would then give the respondent a 1 year grace period. This result is unwarranted given that the scheme of the legislation is to encourage discussions between debtor and creditor and the respondent has refused to discuss mortgage issues. Further, the respondent's refusal to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review by the Farm Land Security Board. No costs to any party.","FIAT. The applicant motion materials filed by the respondent were deficient and ought to include a copy of the notices of intention with proper proofs of service and a specific deposition as to whether the land in question is or has been 'homestead'. The Farm Land Security Board ought to complete it mandatory tasks under Section 12 under the Act and provide its report in the format described in s. 12(4),(5) and(7) of the Act. The apparent refusal by the applicant to provide information should not be allowed to derail the process of financial review as information is available from other sources to deal with the matters in Section 12 (12)(a) and (b). The Board may apply incentives to the respondent to participate by following the procedures in Sections 12(5),(6) and 7(7). HELD: The application was adjourned to August 21, 2000 at 1:30 p.m. and leave was given to each of the applicant and respondent to file further materials. 1)The purpose of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act as set out in Section 2 was to encourage discussions between debtors and creditors and the only material before me indicates that the respondent has refused to participate in the discussions on the mortgage issues. The Farmland Security Board was requested to provide a report to the Court following the procedure set out by s.12(12) and s.7 of the legislation by that date. No costs to any party. 2)The deficiency in the applicant's motion might ordinarily merit a simple dismissal of the application, but Section 20 of the act would give the respondent a grace period of 1 year. This result would be unwarranted given that the scheme of the Saskatchewan Farm security legislation is to encourage discussion between debtor and creditors. The only material that indicates that a respondent hasn't refused to Participate on the Mortgage Issues was a letter from the Board requesting further materials and a fiat to the Farm Land Board."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The material clearly showed the appellant received notice that he was named as a party and in fact was the only party named as landlord. An itemized list of the damages claimed was attached to the notice. There was nothing to indicate he was unable to prepare and present a defence. 2)There was no error of law. The definition contained in s.2(d)(ii) was considered in Lachance v. Auzano Asset which held s.2(d)(ii) was determinative of the issue. The Act is intended to provide an informal and efficient procedure for determining landlord and tenant disputes. This goal is facilitated by permitting such individuals as property managers to assume the role and status of landlords (Lachance).","This was an appeal from a decision of the Deputy Rentalsman ordering the landlord to pay the sum of $3,414 to the respondent.

The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He displayed pictures of aborted fetuses on his signs. He took photographs of the demonstration. He also displayed messages that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids. He carried signs that read 'Planned Parenthood Aborts Babies'. He displayed these messages while demonstrating outside Planned Parenthood's Sexual Health Centre. He shouted them at patients and potential patients of the health care facility that were against abortion, and displayed images of aborted fetus. He posted these signs on his Facebook page. At the hearing, the applicant argued that his Charter rights were violated and sought a writ of prohibition from proceeding with the hearing of the charges on the grounds that whatever occurred while he was picketing Planned Parenthood amounted to professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act. His application for a writ was denied and he was ordered to pay costs of the hearing.  2) The Court was unable to find that the matters in question were res judicata. It ordered that the charges against the applicant be quashed or prohibited from proceeding and ordered that costs be pursued entirely in the amount of $16,000. It was also unable to determine whether the applicant had an alternative method of securing justice for the parties because judicial review is a discretionary remedy and there was no evidence that this alternative would have been available in the circumstances."

6_2007nsca73.txt,"At the time of the deceased's death, she held a bank account jointly with her daughter. Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and the estate of her late mother. Over $50,000 was held on deposit in the account by the appellant and the respondents. Akerley and Ms. Gregoire served as adminstratrix of the late Mrs. Scott's estate. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not find that any of the witnesses lacked credibility. The evidence was such that he did not have contradictory testimony before him. He focused on assessing the evidence available to the court and applying the appropriate legal principles; the standard of review applicable for all factual conclusions made by the trial judge is palpable and overriding error."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the third floor of the building and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the fire alarm system in their building was not functioning at the time of the fire and that they had to jump from their apartment in order to get to the fire department. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the plaintiff's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The smoke detector was not working, the ceiling fan in the apartment was blackened, the fire door was open and there was a broken self-closing hatch on the north hallway door. The door to the second floor was open but the windows on the third and fourth floors were not closed. The battery operated smoke alarm in the second story did not function at the relevant time and the plaintiff was uninformed and unaware that the smoke detector would not have detected smoke and gone off if the doors were locked."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.",The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff had sought an injunction restraining its use of the premises by the plaintiff. The plaintiff contended that the defendant had a strong prima facie case on the merits and that the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was granted. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiffs inconvenience will be greater than that which will be suffered by the defendants if the injunctions were granted. On the basis of Mullin's affidavit the court dismissed the application for an interim injunction. The applicant failed to show that the inconveniences the plaintiff will suffer will outweigh the benefit to the defendant.
7_1998canlii13374.txt,"Associates, which held purchase money security interests pursuant to its 1997 leases, applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldt Flour Mills in two reefer trailers. Humboldt's security interests were acquired pursuant to a security agreement granted in 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in 1998 to specifically include the trailers. It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt in two reefer trailers. The respondent argued that the purchase money security interests in the two trailers were acquired pursuant to its leases of the trailers to Lake Air in 1997 and 1998 and that accordingly Associates could not rely on s34(2) for priority because its purchase-money security interests were not perfected within the 15 days of that date as required by the section. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that the security interests be in possession and that the respondent's security interests should have priority over those of the respondent. 1)The respondent was not in constructive possession prior to December 22, 1997 through either the respondent or Mid-Canada.  2)It was obvious that the trailers were not in the physical possession of the applicant until it agreed to accept the debt. By an amendment registered on January 1, 1998 the first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by the applicant that the respective trailers were delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease. Such a clause was inconsistent with the submission that the applicant had actual or constructive possession at an earlier date.  3)As far as the case law in Saskatchewan has been aware, the debtor has not as yet interpreted the constructive possession terms of either section 34(2)(a) or section 22. These terms were not contained in either s21 or s33(1) of the previous Act. To deny the respondent priority over the respondent would provide the respondent with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase- money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.  4)Costs from the respondent were awarded to the applicant."

HELD: The application for a stays of proceedings was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence before the Court on the merits of the case as the trial had yet to begin. 2)Judicial information was contained in many of the media reports aired at peak times during the week leading up to the trial, which created an atmosphere of fear and terror surrounding the accused's trial such that it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial by an impartial jury of his peers.  3)The Court found that there was reasonable apprehension of bias and that challenges for cause were desirable. 4)The applicant had not established on a balance of probabilities that his right to be presumed innocent until proven otherwise, or his rights to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal under the Charter, and if there had been a violation of his Charter rights (as there was in the case with regard to the death of a young victim at the hands of members of the Christian Brothers organization) or that he had been prejudiced against him."

She sought to cancel arrears of $3,800 on the basis she will overpay if child support had been calculated in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines on the basis of her actual income for 1999 and 2000.

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The father was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $454 per month. Since the issuance of the order, the father has been unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing.

The father is involved in litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian residential school. Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent's solicitor handling the claim advises no offer to settle has been received. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in the lawsuit involving his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. It is not offensive to direct that the defendant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court.

Both parties accused the other of conduct which diminished matrimonial assets. The wife's mother had advanced the parties a considerable amount of money during the marriage, with the final advance being the subject of an IOU.

The issues were the division of matrimonial assets and liabilities, whether the petitioner is entitled to spousal support and, if so, in what quantum.HELD: The court held that the pension of one spouse was valid and that it would be unfair or unconscionable to divide the pension such as it was during the cohabitation. The respondent was entitled to an equal share of the pension credits earned prior to the marriage, but the pension was not divided with the respondent. The court was satisfied that the parties had lived separate and apart for more than one year and that there was no possibility of reconciliation. All other jurisdictional requirements had been met. The petitioner was entitled receive $1,600 in monthly spousals and the respondent was to receive $2,000 in monthly disability benefits. The issue of whether the pension should be divided equally was not at large, allowing a judge to pick the outcome he prefers from among various alternative dispositions, all of which may be arguably fair, but not necessarily fair."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent.

HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) Although the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, the Court was satisfied in this case that the applicant retained a legal interest in the farm site which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2) The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred.

At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter.

The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.

HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to exercise its jurisdiction as a visitor in the event that a party or entity (such as the University of Saskatchewan) tries to interfere with the student's compliance with its governing policy. 1) This is an extremely sensitive issue and one which must be addressed in order to maintain the integrity of the college's supernumerary resident policy and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies, and potential financial implications for itself, if it should make an exception.  2) The College's secondary concerns for not considering an exception to the policy on the facts in this matter are concerns for possible breaches of provincial labour standard laws, or the PAIRS agreement, or Immigration Canada requirements. Given that the student was such a student and that the College's funding had been prepaid allowed for the suspension with pay which occurred. Funding on an annual basis would have obviated the problem. 3) There is no evidence that the University had any say in the decision to place the student on probation. Jurisdiction to determine fairness of administration goes beyond traditional legal supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. The fact that a student who was suspended for five years and then reinstated on probation for a six-month period has not been a factor in the suspension. It is not clear whether the funding agency had any role in the College’s decision to allow the student to resume the program on a probationary period. Jurisprudence prevails over reasonableness. 4) In this case, the student did not request to be paid his salary during his suspension. 5) The University was at liberty to apply the policy as it has in the past. If an exception is going to be made, it should be done before the visitor convenes the hearing for review of the matter on the merits."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements over a 14 month period between 2005 and 2006. The accused applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference held to consider recommendations on a youth sentence. The Crown and the accused sought a ruling from the court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the conference. HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the conference be held prior to the sentencing hearing.  1) Conferencing is new tool under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) and is subject to a number of important statutory exceptions. The purpose of the conference is to give advice and provide recommendations on sentencing, which also is part of the court process. 2) In order to protect the privacy interests of the youth, the court must be aware that society's interest is a broad concept and includes the impact of the criminal justice system on the youth and the resulting interface between the family and all members of the public. The burden of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The test to be applied, commonly referred to as the 'Dagenais/Mentuck test', requires a balancing of competing interests, that is, freedom of expression and other important right and interests. The evidence before the court rebut the open court principle and support an order pursuant to s. 132 of the YCJA."
7_2006nssc131.txt,"The deceased's cousin commenced an action for nervous shock after she observed the accident in which the deceased bicyclist was killed. Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, commenced an action to recover damages for nervous shock after being hit from behind by a motor vehicle. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident and was defended by the Facility Association. She was present when the accident occurred and was not directly involved. She commenced this action to advance a claim for mental shock. It was admitted that she was physically injured as a result of the injury and that she struck some object with his fist, causing physical injury and arguably suffering emotional pain. The Plaintiff's claim against the defendant was settled for $1,000. The Court concluded that such was not the result. The emotional harm suffered by the Plaintiff was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Regarding the Plaintiff's s. 139 (2)(b) claim, that Section 139 of the Insurance Act entitles certain close family members; father, mother, grandmother, step-sister, spouse, child, etc. to recover from a bodily injury or death. If such a person had been physically injured, the Association would be liable to pay. But since she was emotionally damaged, as was the case with the previous claim, the claim would not have passed the scrutiny of the legislature and the Court would have to conclude that such a claim was not contemplated when the legislation was passed."

HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision the Rentalsman granted them.

The applicant seeks both a variation and rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original support order. HELD: 1) The applicant has established the necessary change in circumstance, namely the introduction of the Guidelines. Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and the applicant is in Saskatchewan. The respondent was served with this motion in October 2006. It is in the view of the court that the respondent can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrear. Given that the petitioner is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he is able to pay reasonable payment. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arreaars, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow the rescission application to proceed, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay arreARS and, secondly, that he will not in the future be able toPay the Arrears. 3) There are a number of factors which should be considered in determining whether an individual has an ability to pay ongoing support. Whether the respondent is ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason should not be considered. The petitioner was awarded judgment in favour of the respondent in November 2006. The court dismissed the respondent's application for rescission."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of Criminal Code. The accused was locked in his vehicle for 17 minutes while the RCMP conducted a search at the side of the road. During this time the officer noted an odour of alcohol from the accused and made a roadside screening demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The officer testified that he thought the accused's face was flushed. HELD: The Court held that the delay of 17 minutes from when the police should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle while he was detained, without arresting or advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of Shire’s Charter rights. The evidence obtained following the action was conscriptive evidence. The Court found that the officer should have been aware of the potential violations under the Highway Traffic Act, S.S. 1984, C. H-3.1 and The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, 1997 and the charges were stayed by the Crown. 1)The delay was intentional. It was foreseeable. 2)There were circumstances that should have prompted the police officer to embark on an investigation of the accused”s possible impairment by alcohol. However, the officer chose to have Shire wait in the police vehicle because the search was being conducted at the roadside. 3)The officer was entitled to make a demand for a sample of breath which in the opinion of the trial judge was reasonably reasonable and practical, he did not make the demand at all. The delay in taking the test and in advising the accused of his right to retain and instruct counsel was excusable. 4)There was no breach of the Charter by the officer. In fact, the delay in detaining Shire while the police were conducting their search of the vehicle was justifiable."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","HELD: The court found that the respondent was in contempt of court for failing to comply with the orders made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007. The court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor and client costs of $13,370. The respondent took no significant steps to comply and remained in contempt until the court issued an order requiring him to pay court costs pursuant to the order and to remove all of the offending equipment from his property. Costs of the contempt application were to be set at $15,000. Given the respondent’s poor conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings and the fact that he had not taken any remedial steps in response to a previous court order, the court was concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment than a sanction."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. It was not an error of the court to give a warning to both witness. The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder of Mr. Byer was that he had asked the witness to change the barrel of the handgun. The handgun had entered the defendant's head, striking the bottom of his right occipital bone and exiting above his right eye. The defendant remained together for four years following the murder. He eventually separated from the defendant. He reappeared on the record and in the absence of the jury towards the end of the trial to solicit input from counsel about the relative trustworthiness of the witness. He gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning, however based on the exchange that took place at the pre-charge conference, his decision appears to have been largely premised on the defence counsel's insistence that the warning not be given."

Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court of Canada before a jury on a charge that he did assault a police officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.

When the police returned to the location of the first call, they found evidence of a disturbance and the occupants of a second residence upset. The police arrested the appellant and found him in a car. The appellant was charged with assault causing bodily harm and mischief. The Crown appealed the conviction which was set aside and a new trial ordered. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge failed to establish that the police officer, who was investigating a disturbance on LaHave Street, was lawfully arresting the appellant when he assaulted the complainant.

8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents hotel employees union filed complaints against the respondent, alleging unfair labour practices. The respondent was refusing to employ the individual complainants because they are members of trade union and participated in the activities of a trade union. The union alleged the respondent was trying to intimidate its employees to refrain from being members of the trade union or participating in their activities. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per the reasons stated in the passage from deSmith. The giving of reasons serves several purposes. First, it gives some assurance to the individual concerned that his or her submissions have been made in good faith and are supported by the evidence. Second, in the absence of even brief reasons, the decision-making process gives no assurance that the ultimate decision-maker, in fact, considers the permanent resident's submissions directly. As there was evidence upon which the Board could find that the respondent committed an unfair labour practice, it was not clear what reasoning led to this applicant being found to be present or future danger to the public."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The plaintiffs were five of the five children of Bessy Wright who died on August 8, 1999 at the age of 86. The deceased had sold two properties she owned between 1992 and 1993. The net proceeds from the former sale was $49,897.25 and from the latter $51,037.83. Their mother also collected pensions ranging from $1,100 to $300 per month. They believed approximately $50,000 was missing. The plaintiff was jointly and severely liable for the payment of these costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate.

The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does the Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with this Court? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) In the case of adjudicator appeals, the Court has jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. The reasoning of the Court in Farmers of North America is not applicable to these circumstances. 4) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 5) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not to be set aside. 6) The applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to establish that a director's certificate was properly issued and that an appeal pursuant to s. 62.4(1)(a) of The Labour Standards Act had the same force and effect as if it were a certificate obtained in a Queen’s Bench judgment for the recovery of debt. The consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 7) There is no evidence before the Court that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. 8) The Court is cognizant of the fact that there are situations where it would be unfair to hold a party to an arbitrary deadline and hold them responsible for failing to file a statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. Such is the reasoning of this Court in Saskatchewan that it is without jurisdiction to open up a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures."
8_2009skqb317.txt,"This is an appeal by the tenant, pursuant to s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of the hearing officer appointed under the Act, who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68, and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlords in possession of the rental unit. HELD: The Court reviewed the facts and found the tenant had not raised any true issues as to the jurisdiction of the hearing. It was the Court's view that the hearing officer had jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter in issue. The notice of appeal and arguments presented by the tenant all relate to the facts as found by the hearing officer and contain no error of law. There were facts before the hearing officer to support his finding that the tenant had significantly disturbed other tenants. Further, the Court found there was ample evidence to support the hearing officer's decision on all his findings of fact. Appeal dismissed.","An appeal pursuant to s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act from a decision of a hearing officer appointed under the Act who, pursuant to ss. 58, 68 and 70 of the Act, ordered that the landlord be given possession of the tenant's rental unit and that a writ of possession be issued to place the landlord in possession. The grounds for the application were that the tenant had unreasonably disturbed other tenants within the meaning of ss. 68(2)(a)(i) of the act. HELD: The material available for review is limited to the notice of appeal from the decision of the hearing officer filed by the appellant, the documents filed bythe hearing officer and the decision by the Hearing Officer. The court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. In this type of appeal, the court may not revisit the questions or issues of fact determined by the hearing officers. There must be some relevant evidence to support a finding of fact, that finding may not be disturbed on appeal. Only when there is not relevant supporting evidence is the line between a valid non-appealable finding and an invalid appealable finding crossed.  1) The tenant had not raised any true issue as to jurisdiction of the court. 2) The tenants' appeal was significantly reduced on the fact that the findings of fact were not to be overturned on appeal as they were not supported by the evidence of fact. 3) There was no error of law. There was evidence that the police were called for the landlord. That the landlord was evicted from the noise and trouble started from the Landlord."
8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused's pre-sentence reports filed show that he had a less active role than his co-accused, Lisa Bluebell, but he did not smash windows, inflict blows and inflict any blows. The victim required stitches and was released only after assurances not to tell anyone were extracted. There was no indication of violence or threats to other persons. The Court found that the evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and that long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding with a term of imprisonment from four to eight years in penitentiary for the predicate offence followed by a lengthy supervision order toward the statutory maximum. The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm on December 28, 2011. The Court found that both the accused and the victim of the assault were at medium risk to re-offend as a result of the offence and the fact that the accused had a previous criminal record for driving while over.08. The accused had been in custody for 13 days following the offence. They were each fined $2,000 and prohibited from driving for one year. The offences occurred at a residence owned by the accused, which was also the residence of the victim. The three accused were convicted of break and enter and assault causing grievous bodily harm. The fourth accused, who was fined $1,000 for assault and a $5,000 fine was convicted of common law violation. The Crown sought a DNA order, a firearms prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. HELD: A decision on an appropriate sentence must be made with reference to the principles of sentencing.  1) The accused did not file a victim impact statement with the court and he was not overly cooperative with the Crown once he was out of custody. 2) The Crown relied on the information contained in the pre-sentence report, the 9-1-1 recording and the character references filed by the individuals. 3) There was a surprising and isolated incident that took place within a short period of time. The impact on the victim and the co-accused was significant as he had a lengthy history of criminal behaviour and had a significant record for offences committed while he was in custody. It would appear that he engaged in activity that incited these three accused to take some action, once their complaints to police went unaddressed. The four accused have a significant criminal record. The common law offender who was charged with common law offences and who was the person who drove the truck through the front door of the residence were significant and long-lasting."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court found the children to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for the interests of the young children. Decisions like this one are life-changing for so many people. The children have proven resilient, the parents are engaged with the criminal justice system, the father is engaged with serious matters, the children have been exposed to harmful interaction for sexual purpose and the father has been absent from the children's lives for the past 3 years. The best interests of these children are arrived at by considering the specific direction of s. 4: Where person or court is required by any provision of this Act other than s. 49(2) to determine the best interest of children, the court must be satisfied that the quality of the relationships the parents have with the children requires them to continue to be in need Of Protection."
9_1997canlii9803.txt,"The respondents applied for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington (KSS) was a development pursuant to s2(d) of the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA) and sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment as required by s9 of the EAA. Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration. The order was granted. The matter was remitted for a trial. HELD: The application was granted with costs to the respondents. 1)The Court found that the KSS project was not a development as defined in s2(d). 2)It was not necessary to consider whether the applicant or the respondents have standing to privately enforce a public right. KSS did not seek costs. 3)There was no disagreement on the essential underlying facts. 4)The affidavit evidence filed by the appellant and the respondents was based primarily on conjecture, speculation and hearsay with no basis in fact. 5)The affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant were not in issue. 6)The evidence filed with the Department of Agriculture under the Agricultural Operations Act and the Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management were both of the opinion that the proposal was not developed as defined by the Environmental Assessment act. 7)The court did not permit the use of affidavits taken at their highest probative value as they did not prove on the requisite standard of proof that the project was development. 8)The application of HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor status was not considered. 9)The respondents did not request costs. 10)The issue of costs was whether KSS had standing to make an application for an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of The EAA.  12)Costs were not considered on the substantive issue of the appeal."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 Orders of Production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records to determine whether there were other circumstances in the applicant's life that would place the child in need of protection. The applicant argued that this threshold was inappropriate for proceedings commenced pursuant to the Children and Family Services Act. This threshold was established for civil proceedings in which the records sought are often well-defined and generally narrow in scope. This information is relevant to the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. HELD: The court was not satisfied that the production of all of the orders of production requested would save costs. The court must determine whether the document is to be produced, whether it will save costs, and whether its production will be injurious to the public interest. It must consider the interest of the Minister to develop and evaluate an appropriate plan of care for the child, other than those already disclosed. The records are not relevant for this purpose. 1)The applicant's request for documents containing information about identified issues was not credible. 2)The court found that the Ontario legislation in s.74(3) specifically provides the threshold for the determination of relevancy. The threshold is that a document may be relevant. This is a low threshold; the applicant must demonstrate that she is presently receiving the information. 3)Costs in the amount of $12,000 are not a factor in this case."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b).

HELD: 1) The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or trial although he and the child were cohabitating. 2) The children are 11 and 11 years of age and they have been in the care of the Department for 31 months. 3) The evidence in the custody hearing was that the respondent had been hit three days out of seven by the respondent. The child did not appear to be able to handle the stress of school activities or the pressures of his new school year. 4) The imputed amount of money raised by the application was $10,000. 5) The Court found that the amount of support the respondent should not outweigh the actual cost of the application. 6) There was no evidence that any criminal charges were laid as a result of this information. 7) The child was found to be in need of protection under s. 11(a)(i) of the Act. 8) In respect of [J.S.' (who was 11 years old and in grade at the time of this application) the Court found the respondent to be a person having sufficient interest in [J.'s] company. 9) The petitioner did not participate in pre- trial or trial proceedings. 10) The matter was directed that the trial date be reviewed and that the order continue until the completion of the trial."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. The appellant appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling in favour of using a particular billing code which indicated in effect that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The Government cross-appealed, arguing that both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed; the AU code is best characterized as a 'payment schedule' which allows the Government to request further information about the services underpinning an account and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. The principles of the Payment Schedule and the Protocol are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. However, they do not amount to an individualized administrative process and the principles set out in the payment schedule suggest that the Government has some authority to look behind the face of the accounts presented for payment."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the victim had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. The victim was standing on a street corner when the accused was shot in the back with a rifle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been convicted of five breaches of probation, two breaches of undertaking, and two resisting arrest/obstruction charges. He was on an undertaking to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He also had a prior record for violent offences. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. 1)Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, releasing the accused from custody would cause unnecessary hardship. 2)The accused will suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody until his appeal is heard. He will likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The Youth Criminal Justice Act requires strict conditions to be met in order for a young person to attend school. 3)The Court was concerned that the accused would fall behind in his schoolwork and be unable to complete his high school education in a timely fashion. The Court was not persuaded that his release would be in the public interest. 4)The applicant must prove his detention is sufficiently meritorious that, by the time he appeals is heard, he will have served at least one-half of the sentence as imposed or what would have been fit sentence by the hearing of the appeal. It prevents the applicant from serving more time in custody than that which is subsequently decided to be appropriate in the sense, there is a speculative dimension of this criterion."
9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","HELD: The Court found that both the accused and the victim were sexually assaulted by the accused. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the offences occurred over a number of years. The Court did not accept the accused's denial that there was no digital penetration. The Crown asked the Court to find that the accused touched the victims under their clothing. The accused agreed to have a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e). The Court was satisfied that the sexual assaults were numerous and that they occurred on every occasion the accused was in his presence at Willow Bunch, Regina and Winnipeg. The Defence called both victims to testify, namely, Leanne Eger and Leopold Therrien. The first aggravating factor the Crown asks to find is the frequency of the assaults. The second aggravating factors the Court must prove are: 1) that the two victims described only a couple of incidents when this occurred; 2) that they have no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions; and 3) there was digital penetration by the malevolent intent of the accused who took every chance he could to get more. He got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. He may well have started by feeling and rubbing the victims over their clothing when they were sitting on his knee. As the victims got older and Mr. Therrien little bolder, he went to feeling and touching the girls under their clothes, and kissing them hard on the mouth. His penis became erect. He breathed heavily. He tried to dry hump the victim. He was always calm and in control."

At issue was whether the trial judge erred in law by entering a conviction when the form of Information before the Court was not bilingual in form contrary to s. 841(3).

There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences.

Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred.

A three year sentence was to be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. A lengthy sentence will seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate.

In requesting an adjournment of the preliminary hearing, the accused indicated that he expects to make full disclosure by the end of October. 3) The delay occasioned by the Crown's failure to make timely disclosure is 9 months. 4) The prejudice to the accused has been substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.  5) There are factors that must be considered in determining whether delay has been unreasonable. The Supreme Court of Canada set out the factors set out in R. v. Morin, 1990 CanLII 45 (SCC), at p. 12. However, the balancing of society's interest in requiring an accused to stand trial and the right of the accused to trial within reasonable time is best achieved by examining whether the accused was prejudiced by the delay such that it warrants an inquiry into the extent to which the Crown breached its obligations under s. 11(b). 6) In failing to provide timely disclosure, the Crown has deliberately failed to meet its obligations. 7) The 8-month delay in proceeding with the Preliminary hearing falls to the Crown as does the 1-1/2 month delay from the first appearance on May 12 to the third appearance in June when sufficient disclosure had been made to allow the accused, who was not prepared to make his election, to make an informed election."
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. HELD: The portions of the affidavit that were objected to were struck. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt.  1) The General Rules require an undertaking be given to a solicitor on a contingency basis to ensure that the parties pay the defendant's disbursements. 2) The solicitor agreed to defer payment of his account from the parties until the successful conclusion of the litigation with SCIC (Q.B. Rule 129) or Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure).  3) The affidavit is not evidence but hearsay and opinion. If more were needed, one need only note that these statements of account were all directed to the respondent without objection.  His inquiry of March 12, 1997 makes it clear also that the lawyer recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the matter of his client's account.  4) In other words, the solicitor was not bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember the events of the previous evening and that he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. 3) In a sexual assault case, the accused is guilty of extreme drunkenness. He contends that at the time he was in a state of intoxication that renders him unaware of or incapable of consciously controlling his behaviour. The Court reviewed the cases and found that s. 33.1 does away with this defence in sexual assault cases. It is difficult to understand how someone who is so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina but the rules of fundamental justice are satisfied by showing that the drunken state was attained through the accused's own blameworthy conduct. 4) In the case before the court, the Court was satisfied that there was insufficient evidence, independent of the complainant's testimony, from which the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that she did not consent. It was not possible to rely on her bare denial which, because she has no memory, is in effect an assumption by her. 5) In case like the one before the Court had to reconsider this issue taking into account the evidence subsequently adduced by the defence."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown that was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of the Crown's proceeding was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the Crown in the amount of $18,000.  1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence. He relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to losing of jurisdiction over the accused and not the offence; 2)An information was sworn in Saskatchewan two days after the Alberta information was issued. The respondent was summonsed to appear and did not appear. The matter was adjourned for hearing.  3)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over him in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. 4)The special plea was not applicable in this case. 5)An appeal of the acquit was not allowed. 6)The court had not lost jurisdiction. The court could have regained jurisdiction by following the procedure set out in s.487.1 of the Code. 7)The accused was acquitted of all three charges. 8)The charges were found to be the same charges. 9)The Special Pleadings were stayed. 10)The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction when nothing happened in March, 2001 and the subsequent appearance in May/March 29, 2001 but was not restored until May 7/2001. In the Alberta proceeding, the court was awarded three months leave to defend both charges.  12)The Crown sought to have the matter recommenced in Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan court was not in any way disinclined to do so. 13)The province was awarded costs in the addition of two months to the respondent."
b_2002skqb250.txt,"FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones on May 14, 2002. The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. Saskatoon's daily newspaper applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The accused entered a guilty plea and was not played for the sentencing judge. The applicant's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of theCD-ROM because the accused entered guilty plea. Now, the journalists wish to hear that evidence. The Registrar of the Provincial Court advised the applicant that it must apply to the appropriate court with notice to the Crown for an order to obtain access. Both counsel agree that the proper court to determine the issue of access is the Court of Queen's Bench. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD-RROM to the applicant. HELD: The applicant seeks an order for mandamus, or a declaration. The court must be concerned that no harm befalls innocent parties. This CD-Rom will invariably hold conversations made by innocent parties; it is the appropriate forum to hear those conversations.  1) The accused has entered his own business and is making regular business trips and attending his usual meetings and business hours. 2) The court is mindful of the usual balances of interests and balances of law and order in our judicial system. 3) There is a presumption in favour of public access to court records and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in R. v. S.J.S., [2000] S. J.S. 1; Leader-Post v. Neuls (Q.B.) is that the presumption is in favour for public access and the presumption to public access is now under the administration of the Attorney General. The burden lies on the person responsible for denying the right, who would denied the exercise, such as a denial of exercise, to take his or her own life. The appropriate court is the Queen’s Bench which is also the appropriate venue to obtain such relief."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was dismissed and the defendant was ordered to provide additional security in the amounts of $18,000 (the amount of the counterclaim was reduced to $1,460,246.10). The plaintiff counterclaimed for services and materials provided to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract but the defendant abandoned the project and applied for a stay of the order which allowed it to file its own lien. HELD: The order for security was granted and the requested security was set out in Rules 538 and 539 of the Queen's Bench Rules. There was no difference between the law in Ontario and the law of Alberta on this issue. The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily preclude an order for costs but, in the circumstances, the court has discretion to make an order where it is most appropriate.  1)Section 56(1) creates a discrete process to vacate liens. To facilitate that process, it provides an arbitrary method to substitute a trust fund in this court in place of the common trust fund. 2)The plaintiff commenced the builders' lien action long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. 3)The defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which included a claim for supplies and materials respecting a failed attempt to construct a crossing under the North Saskatchewan River.  4)Costs of the action were awarded. 538(1). The defendant asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers was liable for any award of costs that may be made against the plaintiff. 539(c) was not invoked. 541(2)The court reviewed case law respecting lien and determined that the claim is not wholly distinct from the claim.

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","The respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant. Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. HELD: The appeal was dismissed orally. 1) It was not necessary for us to call upon counsel for the respondent, given the conduct of the respondent in the ensuing year was of the view that, even if his conduct constituted breach of a clause prohibiting himfrom soliciting customers, the respondent has not shown that it suffered any loss. Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belterrail has not satisfied us that it has suffered any losses attributable to this breach. Assuming the conduct did not constitute a violation of contract, the appellant has not been satisfied. 2) The respondent's loss, so to speak, consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at profit.

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The evidence was excluded because the trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and that pursuant to sec. 24(2) of The Charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The acquittal was upheld and a new trial ordered. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results of the results, or should not have, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can at the scene and the results could be inaccurate. The Certificate of Analysis should be excluded from evidence at trial. The Court reviewed the facts in Einarson and held that the officer was entitled to rely on the findings of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable, and probable, grounds to arrest the appellant when he knew there was a possibility that the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the application of the test and that if she had, the result could be accurate. A new trial must therefore be held and is ordered.Criminal Law on approved roadside screening devices has been summarized in R. v. Mastromartino, 2004 CanLII 28770. The appeal and appeal on appeal dealt with two Crown appeals and two defence appeals relating to four separate individuals each of whom registered fail result from an ASD test performed within 15 minutes of each having left tavern. Common ground was the fact that not all relevant evidence was assessed. Whether the wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine is speculation."
b_2008skqb182.txt,"The tenant appeals the decision of the Hearing Officer granting her landlord a possession order of her rental premises. The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The tenants request an adjournment so that she can make arrangements to personally attend the hearing.  1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements. 2) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. 3) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence', breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles."
b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, when he died intestate. After his death, the wife, who had signed a separation agreement, applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement to determine whether a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounced a given gift after his death. The executrix of the estate applied for a review of the separation agreement and discovered that the wife had not renounced her right to share in the deceased's estate pursuant to the will; she was entitled to the gift under the will. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge relied on Billing, supra, Eccleston, and Morguard; the case of Hadley v. Morrell, which dealt with the possibility of a pre-death contractual obligation to a person who had renounced an interest in something to which he or she had no legal interest. The wording in Hadley's judgment was very similar to that in that it did not purport to revoke the will nor did it affect the right of the former spouse to take the benefits for herself pursuant to that will; the Chambers judge's decision to hold that the gift to the appellant was an unconditional renunciation did not have any legal effect on her; although she may have waived any claim against the estate of her late husband and wished to share it with him in the future, it was not clear from the wording that she had waived any right to claim against it; there would need to be compelling reasons to override the testator's intentions and on which an avoidance can operate."
b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was found guilty of several drug offences after police entered his home and searched his home without a warrant. The accused alleged a breach of s. 8 of the Charter by the police entry and search of his home. The police conducted a search of the home and found drugs and alcohol in the home, along with a search warrant. At trial, the trial judge held that the police had a responsibility to enter the house and search the premises, all with a warrant; in the circumstances, the call was not a 911 call but rather a 'distress' call. The evidence heard on that Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant; the evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded. The trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's calls to the police were not hoaxes but rather statements made by the accused to the officers to ensure that no other person was located and to ensure he had no weapon. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; the police's conduct in this case was reasonable and conducted within the course of the police duty to protect life and prevent injury. Although the call may have been a distress call, the fact that it was made by an alleged victim or from his home did not constitute circumstances of distress."

The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses. The costs owed by the petitioner to the respondent are set-off against the amount owing; the respondent shall pay $3,452 to the child's outstanding debts by or before February 15, 2011.","The applicant brought an application to vary paragraph 1(b) of the order of Wilson, J. She sought an order that the child was still child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.) and an order requiring ongoing and retroactive payments by the respondent for some of the child's extraordinary expenses for post-secondary education. The parties were unable to settle the sharing of the daughter's educational expenses for 2008/2009. HELD: 1) The chambers judge should match the amount paid by the applicant towards the applicant's expenses. The applicant must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she did not apply herself to her studies. The father should not be ordered to pay the table amount. It is my view that an application of clause 3(2)(b) having regard to the actual means and needs of the applicant and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to her support be considered. 2) The father was ordered to contribute $3,452.00 on or before February 15, 2011. These monies may be applied directly to the children's outstanding debts. The burden is on the applicant to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. 3) In Hagen v. Rankin 2005 SKQB 393, the Court advises that the amount of support payable by the father in accordance with the provisions of s.3(1)(a) is rebuttable. The amount claimed by the mother is $1,067.65. She is responsible for some significant loans, but in the face of these concerns being raised by Mr. Johnson, she has given me no evidence to rebut him's information that she didn't attend many of her classes. In all of the circumstances, it is the burden of a child of the marriage to take on a substantial amount of debt if she does not learn to pursue her own studies. In this case, the child is not a party to the marriage. The child is an adult child and must be expected to attain her full potential. It would be unfair to require the child to attend only one class at a time and then rely on the support of another child when she is not attending classes or attending classes at the other school.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen's Bench for appropriate disposition or to address further cost and delay we have decided to do the latter. [2] Turning to the merits, we note that the principal question is whether the imputed allegations in the statements of defence & counterclaim meet the requirements of Queen’s Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. But without at least giving the applicant the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations cannot fairly be struck out as not answering to the requirement of Rule 149."

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the hearing hearing officer is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Hearing officer for a re- rehearing. 1) The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. The Court found the reasons inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter was remitted onto the Hearing Officer. 2) There is nothing in the Act which prohibits or requires the director to schedule multiple applications relating to the same dispute to the Same Hearing Date. In any event, the simple fact that the tenants' application is not formally before the same hearing officer at the same time as the landlord's application does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord\'s dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order. The Act addresses powers, procedure, evidentiary issues and scheduling in sections 73-78. It is not completely clear from the file what, if anything the tenants paid in response to the April letters. The portions of their affidavit which go to their substantive argument (i.e. the existence of and efforts made to combat bed bugs) are not admissible and will be disregarded."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicated it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. The one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term. 2) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act and the 2006 Rules of Court. 3) The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month to monthly tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. A 1/2 month notice provision referred to in the Term of the Lease was only applicable if the tenant was committed to the fixed Term of one year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012.  4) The respondent gave written notice to the landlord advising she was terminating the tenancy and giving up possession of the premises on the 31st of October 2012. The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to re-renting it. 5) The applicant did not advertise the unit for rent until the middle of January 2013 and obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month.  6) The appellant appealed the hearing officer's interpretation of s. 20 of The Residential Tenancy Act, 2006 in finding it was not an error to note that the phrase 'to take whatever is reasonable to minimize damage or loss does not eliminate an entitlement to compensation; rather it mandates an adjustment in the amount of compensation."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference.

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 [$3,964 plus $2,500] for failing to repair the flooring, which was found to be caused by structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. Leaking of water through the ceiling, sagging ceiling tiles and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing. The evidence does show that a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage."

b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 210(m) of the Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The Director opposed approval of the proposal on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal proposed by the applicant that shareholders of record should be given their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital to them rather than having a portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA. The applicant argued the court has the power to approve such an arrangement under the powers given to it under s.186.1(4), s. 203(8) and the power given to the Court in s.210(m). HELD: 1) The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate for the purpose contemplated by the legislation. It found no conflict with the s. 220(1)(e) directions contained in the Act and the provisions of the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (BCA). 2) There was no conflict between the mandatory requirements in ss. 220 and 221 of the BCA and with the power granted by the Court to the Supreme Court in the SCCA to the Board of Directors in each case. 3) The purpose of the legislation was to allow the corporation to dispose of and convert into money, property in its possession owned by creditors and shareholders who cannot be found. 4) The proposed arrangement did not involve any elements of change of control or of shareholders being required to exchange one type of shares for other assets. The rationale for the arrangement was that the Shareholders have already sustained significant loss on their investment as result of the oppressive acts of former management. The plan proposed for the corporation was to assist in relieving shareholders against the losses suffered by them and provide them with a reasonable opportunity to identify themselves and to obtain return of their respective original investments. The context within which this was provided must be considered. 5) The application was dismissed with no problems."
b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue before the Court was whether the accused was bound by s.7 of the Regulations, made pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1995 and whether the regulation violated his Treaty right to fish for sustenance/food. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence presented was that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so chooses. The evidence also showed that the restriction on fishing in one of the closed fishing areas was a conservation measure in that it would not jeopardize the accused's Treaty right."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis and possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence was that it was property obtained by the commission of an indictable offence in Canada."

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code are summarized in this sentence: a global sentence of 15 years to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction.  2) The accused has 55 previous convictions, 17 of which are for violent offences. He has shown no remorse since he in drunken stupor shot his cousin in the head for no apparent reason. 3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Crown is relying primarily upon three cases. The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He had an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions, 15 of which were for violence offences. There were numerous Gladue factors to be considered, which the Court was of the view would result in a net sentence of 11 years and months. The evidence showed that the accused had previously displayed a lack of remorse for his actions, which included threats to shoot his cousin and his willingness to accept a firearm from niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken. It was apparent to the Court that there may be restorative programs available that would not be accessed if the Court made such an order."

The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days. Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year.","The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties, a declaration of ownership regarding personal property and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The parties cohabited for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was the owner of a mobile home and her three children from a prior marriage lived in it. For the twelve years between 1975 and 1988, the plaintiff earned $17,409.95 per year. Her income diminished due to reduction in hours worked and in 1986 she stopped her employment altogether. The defendant paid support pursuant to an application made under the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The respondent's claim for unjust enrichment was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment including that the contribution was sufficient to entitle him to an interest in the property.  1)The respondent's contributions were both direct and indirect. Her involvement in his business directly assisted in the preservation of the property and its continuation in his absence. 2)There was no juristic reason for the enrichment which the court found in Pettkus v. Becker. 3)The court distinguished family law cases from commercial ones and found that 'constructive trust' and 'unjust enrichment' are not synonymous expressions. The respondent was awarded general and special damages of $2,000.00 for each $1,000 awarded to the wife. 4)In this case, the respondent met the third requirement of proving unjust enrichment. The fact that the parties lived together for twelve years and had three children together, despite the fact that they were living in a common law relationship, did not diminish the petitioner's contribution. The evidence showed that the contributions made by the respondent, that she personally participated in the preparation of the annual rental increase notices, and that she was the person responsible for typing the notices to quit when they were given. 5)The parties agreed that the value of the respondent's property must display an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any other reason for enrichment."

HELD: 1)The accused was acquitted of the charge in the indictment.  2)The complainant was not as credible as the accused as she was and although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that he had attempted to have sexual intercourse with her when she was or was 9. He subsequently moved from the Indian Reserve to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. She was not even 11 when the offences occurred. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench had exclusive jurisdiction only when a matter was transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Young Offenders Act. The Court of Prince Albert had jurisdiction only if such a matter had been transferred to a youth court. 4)The evidence was not particularly credible as a witness. She did not attempt to embellish or exaggerate her testimony even though she had the opportunity to."

There was no application to set aside any of the garnishee summons' by the Defendant and he did not appear on this application.

Sokulski, the respondent's lawyer, was personally serve with the garnishees but he failed to appear.

The chambers judge exercised his discretion to set aside the judgment obtained against the plaintiff.  4)The court was satisfied that the chambers judge had exercised his inherent power to resolve disputes between the parties. It would be incongruous were it otherwise to order the return of money paid out of court to the creditors.  5)The judgment debtor appears only to have been served with one of the two pre-judichee summonses.

c_1996canlii5236.txt,"The respondents were granted an order by a Chambers judge pursuant to s. 38(1) of the Bankruptcy Act which authorized them to commence a fraud action against the appellant, a bankrupt. In making his ruling, the Chambers judge found that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt estate for the purposes of s. 38(1). The respondents subsequently commenced an action against the appellant. The appellant applied to the judge assigned to oversee the case management of the action for an order striking the Statement of Claim on the basis that the respondents were not creditors of the bankrupt estate and, therefore, should not have been granted the order authorizing the commencement of the action. The case management judge held that he did not have the jurisdiction to inquire into the merit of the s. 38 order. He dismissed the action. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that the case management judge did not err. The appellant could not collaterally attack the s. 38 order by challenging a factual finding made in the granting of the order.","The appellant sought to strike the respondent's Originating Notice and Statement of Claim. He argued that the chambers judge erred in that he did not have jurisdiction to review the s. 38 Order but, when he did, acted with bias in his handling of the application. Dismissing the appeal, that the Chambers judge properly considered the admissible and relevant evidence before him. The order in this case is not analogous to the situation before us. In B.N.R. the Chambers Judge was granted jurisdiction to Review the Order, which was not binding upon the defendant. The judge reviewed the record to the extent necessary and determined that the respondents were creditors. He did not allow the appellant's application to challenge the finding of fact by Palmeter, A.C.J. that, for the purposes of the action, the respondents are creditors. The appellant's argument that the Chamber judge was biased in his granting of the Order was dismissed. There was nothing in the extensive record before the Court to indicate that the judge acted other than in an impartial and fair manner in considering the application by the appellant."
c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The appellant appealed the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no material error in the analysis of the words in Article 16 in the context of the whole agreement. The Chambers judge was of the view that the majority had brushed aside basic grammatical conventions, proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the appellant, and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions, including alterations wrought by changing the ordinary meaning of any of thewords in the course of interpreting its provisions."
c_1998canlii13623.txt,"FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992. The husband petitioned for divorce and corollary relief in 1992. The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","FIAT. The parties negotiated settlement of all of the outstanding issues including divorce, custody of the children, division of matrimonial property and spousal support payable by the husband to the applicant. At issue was whether the agreement was intended to be final and whether the applicant had established that she could not be self-sufficient. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was found to be inimical to the breakdown of the marriage and since there was no unforseen or radical change in the circumstances that had been demonstrated the application was premature.  2)It was agreed the agreement would be final. 3)Costs were declined. 4)The applicant had failed to make out her case and therefore the Court had no alternative but to dismiss the application."

Although the plaintiff's claim is fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant applies for an order of this nature dismissing the respondent's application and restoring the claim of set-off being advanced. The respondent is granted leave to reply if so advised to the appellant's' prayer for relief in its motion to claim the full amount of the premiums payable. This appeal should be allowed in part. There are a number of 'housekeeping' items that must be addressed in order to facilitate the orderly disposition of the action and the addition of new material facts pertaining to that defence.The appellant has been awarded summary judgment for $38,585.00. It has satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit v. Kostuchuk et al., 1994 CanLII 3870 and Winfield Developments Ltd. v. Banton Industries Ltd.

Since the respondent/plaintiff has not accepted the amount tendered in payment of the appraisal, the appellant is granted a leave for reply to the respondent's application to the same. This is an appeal of an order in October 1998 dismissed. In the circumstances, we must treat the counterclaim as an independent action. There has been significant delay in these proceedings and it will probably be many months or longer before the plaintiff’s action is tried."
c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT. The husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement dated June 18, 1975. By virtue of paragraph 4(a) of the agreement the parties agreed the initial sum of $550 would be paid for spousals and further agreed that a reduction in the husband's income as a consequence was or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The agreement provided for annual adjustments based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The respondent was 67 years old and retired. He had always earned a considerable income although he deposes to a number of substantial business investment losses in the United States. He also had a locked-in pension with an asset value of $215,000 and house worth approximately $126,000. He married approximately two years ago. The fact it had occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreements. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spouse support.

c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced by the defendants. The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with the CMHC through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the apartment complex. The defendants made application for further disclosure. At issue was whether the plaintiff had waived his solicitor-client privilege by interposing an affirmative defense of good faith reliance on the government's regulations and communications. HELD: The application was granted. The defendant was ordered to produce all of the documents sought. 1)The plaintiff knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to discovery and then by attending the discovery and in the absence of objection evinced an intention to partially waive it.  2)The documents sought were not privileged. They were found to be outside the meaning of the terms of the defendant's retainer. 3)In view of subparagraph (3) it was necessary to examine the circumstances giving rise to the application for the documents. The state of mind exception to solicitor and client privilege was examined carefully and exhaustively in Lloyds Bank Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co. (1991), 179 N.S.R. (2d) 204 (S.C.) (Ont. Ct.) (1983) and in final consideration at the Supreme Court of Canada in Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst Young (2001), there was little difference in practice between the two approaches.

The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence. HELD: The application was allowed to proceed. The matter was adjourned for a hearing. The court was required to determine whether there were compelling reasons to keep the Young Person in custody. It would seem that an application to continue custody would be a marked departure, procedurally, from our previous experience under the Young Offenders Act.

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation.

The defendants brought a motion to dismiss the action on the basis that the expert witness did not meet the standard of care imposed upon lawyers undertaking the task of representing a client in her circumstances nor with respect to the application and alleged breach of that duty of care by the defendants. HELD: The application was dismissed and the defendants were entitled to one set of costs only against the plaintiff, the same to be taxed pursuant to column unless any other provisions of the Queen's Bench Rules were applicable. 1)The trial judge determined that the plaintiff was convicted of professional negligence and that her calling of a legal expert to provide opinion evidence was not sufficient evidence to determine whether the plaintiff would have succeeded at his original trial. 2)There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach the conclusion on either of the two fundamental issues raised by this case. The trial judge by weighing the evidence and deciding the substantive issue of causation applied the higher test of the balance of probabilities rather than the lower standard for non-suit. The plaintiff's argument was persuasive and must prevail. 3)The plaintiff was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts. She chose not to. 4)There is no evidence upon which a jury could conclude that professional negligence is within or beyond the competence of a jury to decide without the aid of expert evidence. The test to be applied by this Court in adjudicating upon an application for a negligence case in the circumstances was recently addressed by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in the case of Hagblom v. Henderson and Campbell (2003 SKCA 40). The issues raised involve substantial legal expertise and tactics respecting the conduct of the plaintiff's case both in preparation for and at the trial. It is unsatisfactory for a finder of fact to conclude that such standard of conduct was inherently negligent.  5)The Court was awarded judgment against the defendants and awarded a half-million dollars in damages to the plaintiff.  6)The plaintiffs claim was dismissed with costs of the trial to the defendants, the court was awarded one set at $1,500 and the rest were awarded to the plaintiffs. The case law does not require expert evidence to decide whether a negligence claim can be judged. 7)The case law recognizes the importance of calling expert evidence at trial where the issue is a matter beyond the ordinary competence of the jury."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the proposed judgment are unconscionable. There has not been equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner has chosen not to seek legal counsel and advice. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The terms of the proposed consent judgment were improvident. The Court could not condone the legal advice given by the petitioner and no legal counsel could be expected or encouraged to do so. 2)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. They could continue to plan without the formality of a judgment or contract. 3)When the terms of a consent judgment appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to the parties, it was the Court's role to refuse the application. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposed judgement was anything but unconscionalable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently cruel and unfair the judgment was to her. 4)The Court was of the view that the consent judgment could be seen as an attempt to normalize the relationship and to provide the petitioner with the assistance she would need to achieve her objectives. 5)The court could not offer legal advice nor advice but would urge her to seek it. Counsel could not and would not advise her on the best way to obtain the advice and guidance that she needed to succeed in this task. Counsel would have to step in and provide guidance and counsel. 6)The proposed judgment was unconscionaous. There was not equality in bargaining positions. The petitioner was not permitted legal advice or advice but was encouraged to seek advice and advice from counsel who could gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she had thereunder. The proposed judgment provided that the petitioner is not obliged to pay child support in the foregoing circumstances. The 15 year old qualifies as a child within the meaning of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. Based upon the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97-175, as am.) (the Guidelines), the petitioner's obligation to provide support for this child would be $88 per month. The child will be 18 years old in approximately 18 months time which means, that potentially, the economic value of releasing the petitioner from her obligation to pay support may amount to less than $1,600 in all."
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Court for certiorari to quash the investigation and for an order to return all of the emails that had been obtained. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's appeal. The Commission argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made. It followed that the chambers judge did not allow the Commission the opportunity to rule on this point before the issue of privilege was resolved. The application for a stay of the judicial review was dismissed. The court reviewed the history of judicial review applications and found that judicial review is the only mechanism to resolve issues of solicitor-client privilege. There is no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. The principles of deliberative secrecy and the exercise of discretion on the part of the Commission are at the heart of the regulatory system established by the Act. The balance between confidentiality and disclosure within that process is one that is critical to the effective discharge of the commission's mandate. While there are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed, the commission is in the best position and has the statutory discretion to address the issues of discovery."

The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The defendant appealed the conviction on the following grounds: the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; failing to apply the doctrine of stare decisis; and the verdict was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in the case of R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence was vacated and an acquittal entered. 1) The trial judge correctly set out the state of the law surrounding the defence of diligence in this case. He was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid this offence. A reasonable person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence or to exercise extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. The system implemented by Westfair in R. vs. Friesen to prevent the sale of tobacco to minors was essentially the same as the procedure followed by the other defendant. 2) The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to the incident on August 25, 2003, before the incident, Westfair had an established system created to prevent its cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors. This standard exceeds the requirements of reasonable person.  3) By applying a higher standard of Due diligence, the defendant would have succeeded in establishing the defence for due diligence as was decided in R.' v. W.Fair Foods Ltd.(1992), 138 C.C.C.(3d) 68 (Ont. Prov. Ct.) held at p. 77. To demand more, would move a strict liability offence dangerously close to one of absolute liability."

The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium.

The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the land stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property' as there was no evidence that the respondent filed a statement of defence at the time it made the application and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of proceedings."

The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants purchased logs from Wood Products (1985) Ltd. (Lamp Products), through its contractor, Logging (P E), harvest wood from the forest in and around Glaslyn. They sell this wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the corporation. The defence argued that the process used by the corporation was more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The corporation was involved in the manufacture of forest products for the log home industry. HELD: 1) The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The process utilized by the company is more than mere harvesting. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing licence licence. 2) The defendant took many steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in the loghome packages. It did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. 3) The plaintiff was found guilty of violating the Act. The court found that the defendant had violated the Act by failing to obtain a proper processing facility licence. 4) The court concluded that the plaintiff was guilty of breaching the Act's terms of service. The Court found that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. It was also found that defendant was found to have breached the terms of the Act in relation to the processing facility license. 5) The Court of Queen's Bench did not find the defendant's argument that it was impossible to find based on the evidence presented that the logs sold for log homes sold at the Meadow Lake Pulp Mill were specifically cut for the purpose of logging. The evidence showed that the logging process involved many steps that would constitute a 'processing facility'. The process described by the defendant was substantial and the process was removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land was secondary to the reasonableness of the purpose"
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The parents sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. The parents opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return the boys to their care. At the onset of the trial, the mother of the boys testified that she was overwhelmed as a parent and could not cope with the stress of parenting the boys who had just given birth. She also questioned the sincerity of the parents, who had counselled the boys and assured them that they were doing well in school and that they would be fine. The court found that the parents had a laissez-faire approach to sexuality, which was confirmed by the Court's own assessment of the children's record. The Court found that most importantly, the parents' approach to parenting was found to be the same in both the criminal justice system and the therapeutic foster home where the boys had been residing for several years. As the children had special needs, their upbringing was somewhat unorthodox and there were concerns about their relationships with their extended families. HELD: The Court ordered the boys placed with the Minister until the age of 18. 1) The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. If a child is found in need of protection, the Court is required to look firstly at s.37(1) which requires a determination of whether the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the minister for a temporary period not exceeding 6 months. 2) The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. There is no evidence of violence between the parents. 3) The Court was of the view that the father's approach to his children's upbringing was reflected in the photographs. The photographs were taken in the home by the parents who were living with the children. The father would often advertise at food banks and indicated that there was no fee. The photos were also found in the mother's file. The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry of Social Services' (MSS) concerns for the boys was employed by the family's business. She was responsible for preparing the photos for the exhibit and preparation for their exhibit. The exhibit was exhibited at a food bank and the mother was in the process of obtaining a loan to pay for it. She advised the father that she would consider an assisted adoption if the money was available. The mother was awarded $5,"
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David no longer lives with either parent. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. The fact that the father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the father's income. With respect to the capital gain, which is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of his 2008 income, the father will not earn the sum of $270,000. The parties agreed in 2008 that the petitioner should pay support for two children based on an income of $160,000 and David on the same income. The petitioner is obligated to pay child support for one child for the months from May 2009 to April 2010 based on the actual Federal Child Support Guidelines income. If the parties did not proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order they would be forced to remit back the overpayment."
c_2011skpc61.txt,"The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code. The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.",The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court found that the accused was not only grossly lacking in mental abilities but also had a limited understanding of the nature of the proceedings and its possible consequences.
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: 1) The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The solicitor has no rights greater than those of the client. He owns the shares himself. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor’s lien as being part of the records of the company. The claim for lien is not made out. 2) The court found that the evidence before the court did not allow it to determine the amount owing by Jensen that he was required to deliver. Given the totality of the evidence, the Court did not consider a valid solicitor lien to have been raised. 3) The application to compel the sheriff to produce the shares of Jensen to the court was dismissed. The sheriff has the power to seize shares in order to collect the outstanding debt. 4) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 5) In some circumstances the right is only as between a client and him. In this case the solicitor has a lien against the shares in the plaintiff. 6) The equitable principles as determined by the court in Mariani v. Bergstein are applicable at law as it is in equity. 7) The general rule that a solicitor's Lien can be raised against all persons claiming through the client must be qualified by consideration of whom the rights accruing from the lien are claimed. 8) The Court concluded that the only claim against a solicitor and lien should be made out in light of the uncontroverted affidavit of Barry Jensen. 9) The applicant has no right to refuse production and delivery of documents on which a solicitor has lien. 10) The portion of the affidavit that was cited by the applicant as glaringly silent in that regard does not amount to a valid lien and is not a valid claim to be made."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: possession of a controlled substance for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully possessing property (or proceeds of property), knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355(a); trafficking and conspiracy to traffic.  1) The accused was 34 years old and had no children nor was he employed at the time of the offence. He began drug use in his late teens. 2) He was not involved or engaged in a sophisticated or organized drug trafficking organization. There was no evidence or suggestion that he was, on this occasion, a lone operator working for his own benefit. The amount of cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. His pre-trial detention was in part the product of a failed preliminary hearing date which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the amount of marijuana and cocaine in the defendant's possession, when combined with the significant amount of cash (almost $30,000.00) lead to no other conclusion than that the drugs in question were in question at least at the mid-range of the drug trafficking spectrum. 3) The Court gave the accused credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent on remand to a total of 23 months, 21 days credit."
c_2012skpc90.txt,"The plaintiffs hired the defendant to perform renovations to their home. The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim damages for $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The original estimate was agreed to by the plaintiffs but the defendant applied extra drywall mud to the ceiling, walls and ceiling in an attempt to make them appear flush with the existing walls. The drywall was installed on a crooked frame, the walls and ceilings were not sufficiently sanded and there were four burn marks on the carpet. The plaintiff claims he should have been paid for the work done by the defendant but was not allowed to finish the job. HELD: The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the countertop removal. 1)The counterclaim of the defendant is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs.  2)The plaintiffs were awarded judgment in an unspecified amount. The plaintiffs claim their costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing their claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court. Because the plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim and were awarded the portion of their claim reduced by 10% or $294.00. 3)The defendant is found to have committed a breach of the contract and negligence in that he did not allow the plaintiffs to complete the work performed on his behalf.

c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative under the terms of the conditions of the order in issue (a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution or(b) that it be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: The Court of Appeal does not strike the claim. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. The time spent analyzing the reasons for the delay was not enough to lead it to the position that the claim should be struck on that basis. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is prejudice to the defendant."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is not admissible. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court found that the usual rule of evidence regarding the use of hearsay in evidence did not apply at the time of the application. The judge also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 2) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for the decision. The Court also found that there are cases where the normal criminal rules of law apply. 3) In R. v. Lifchus, 2012 SKQB 94 (CANLII), 138 Sask.R. 273, the Court held that the normal rules of a hearing do not apply. 4) The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The Crown opposed the admission of these documents. 5) Hearsay evidence was admissible in evidence. 6) The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. 7) With respect to the assessment of decision reports, the court held that they were only admissible if it was accompanied by supporting affidavits as described in s.30 of the Criminal Code. 8) The court also held with respect to L'Equipe that s. 723(3)(b) of the Code does not apply to this case. The normal rules in a criminal trial apply. 9) The normal criminal rule of law applies. The trial judge clearly established the burden of proof was on the Crown and that the reasons to order the detention ordered were reasonable ground to believe. 10) The burden is not that of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but rather on a balance of probabilities. Hearsays evidence is admissible at the hearing. 11) The application to exclude a hearing related to a breach of a conditional sentence is dismissed with costs to the applicant. 12) The applicant is awarded costs of the hearing in accordance with s. 3 of the trial. 13) The costs of representing the costs of that hearing are reduced."
c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. The report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff must prove his claim on a balance of probabilities. Although the town employee called by the plaintiff testified that he had used Ally in his yard, there were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through a back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause. The defendant's witness was a town employee. He testified that the cost to him to test for numerous substances until they found the presence of the one killing the grass would have been prohibitive. No samples were taken from an alley, to show for any chemical substance there."
d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products.

The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time himself but would rely on the former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that this was a sufficient basis for him to conclude that the franchise was not viable. He found that the appellant had not made any errors in his assessment of the facts."
d_1993canlii3207.txt,"The respondent was given a three-year suspended sentence and placed on probation after pleading guilty to armed robbery. He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the charge. He had a grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial Judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem. HELD: The respondent's sentence was suspended for three years. A probation order was imposed. He would be prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment. A prohibition order under s.100(1) of the Code should have been imposed. The sentence was not fit."
d_1997canlii10919.txt,"FIAT. Interim custody of two of the children was awarded to the respondent in January 1997. The eldest resided with her mother. Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The Court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. The respondent's 1996 income included the following: Employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy. She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with the respondent's company was terminated. Her total income in 1996 totalled $1,404.44. Given the petitioner's casual employment, it was difficult to determine her level of income for the purpose of her application for maintenance. An attribution of income of $800 per month was fair for the current determination of maintenance. If there was a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent."

The defendant counterclaimed for monies it had already paid to the plaintiff. Awarding the defendant $13,502, and the defendant $5,351 on the counterclaim, that the defendant should not reimburse the plaintiff for expenses arising out of the plea of guilty on the Municipal Affairs Act charge, as the plaintiff admitted to his mistake.

d_1999canlii1536.txt,"A wife claimed part of the estate of her estranged husband. The Court considered the applicability of the Testator's Family Maintenance Act, the Matrimonial Property Act, and the Pension Benefits Act. Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, a medical doctor who had been awarded his LL.M from Yale. The third was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of a doctor and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding the doctor's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The residue of the estate was to be divided, with the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries. The testators' Family Maintenance Act and Matrimonial Property Act apply in Nova Scotia."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to determine the issues on the motion, whereupon the judge shall order summary trial, or the trial of specified issue or issues. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one. 3) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within two and one-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. 4) Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled.  5) In this case the plaintiff does not agree with the judge's description of the meeting or what was said by him during the meeting but will not review the same. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The facts as outlined by the accused on his behalf and by his son-in-law on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the defendant's actions. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. HELD: The accused was found guilty as charged. 1) The Court held that the jury must conclude that the accused driving was the contributing cause of the bodily damage, not just a minor or trivial cause. The Court also held that there was no evidence of the inappropriateness of the comments made by the cheering crowd.  2) In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it was very important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that the physical harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. 3) In the case at bar, two questions must be posed: (1) would the victim have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him; (2) was the assault a contributing cause; (3) was it more than an insignificant and trivial cause; and (4) Was the assault contributing to the pile-up from which the body harm resulted. Without the initial assault, no pileup would have resulted."

The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.

Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy.

The appellant had made an application for information pursuant to s. 40 of the Act. At the beginning of the application, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined all of the accusations made against him. The respondent then appealed to the Attorney General, requesting further information. The AG refused to disclose the information requested, saying it would interfere with the applicant's ability to participate in the criminal investigation. The applicant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of Justice, the Department of Community Service and the ADR Program became meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Acting Attorney General.  2)In the course of the inquiry, the applicant was advised that approximately 70% of the alleged victims of institutional abuse who applied to the school for boys and youth in Nova Scotia had made complaints to the police. 3)The respondent was also aware of the Stratton report and of the various officer-led inquiries into the alleged abuse in the institutions. The information sought was summarized in a 13-page letter outlining his background, work and employment history. 4)He was also assured that he would be compensated for his time spent on the job. 5)The administration of justice was to assist in the investigation of the claims. The process was to be a summary process driven by the applicants/complainants.  6)There was a risk that the information would be leaked to the media or be used in the commission of a criminal offence. The administration was to continue to monitor the quality of the information and ensure that appropriate disclosure was made to the public. 7)The extent of the breach of the trust clause in the Act was beyond the scope of this case. 8)The resulting breach of trust could only be remedied by having the information be provided to the appropriate third party. 9)The applicant was also awarded costs of the appeal in accordance with the terms of the agreement."

In her analysis she made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge thereon. The acquittal because of a reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, include in it finding that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.081 at the time of driving.

d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be sold and ordered to return certain personal belongings. The wife had been cut off from her husband's medical insurance coverage and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also wanted title to her house back. The husband applied to have the home sold, claiming a reversible error in two respects that he had no evidence to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and that he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. Allowing the application and remitting the matter for a rehearing on an expedited basis, that there was no reason why the matter could not be heard again by Justice Scanlan, should his schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and did not require any comment from this Court."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. They separated in October 2004 after the petitioner (who was working part-time and lived with her mother when she was not attending university) filed a counter-petition for divorce. The parties have four children from their first marriage. The petitioner is the primary parent of the children and the primary caregiver to the children. The respondent is 65 years old and retired. He drives a taxi from time to time. He lives in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately 10 minutes walk from the children's school. They have two older children who reside with their mother when they are away from their school and their two younger children live the majority of their time with their father. HELD: After analyzing the evidence and the evidence in the respondent's case, it was concluded that it would be in the best interests of the four children to be placed in the custody and primary care of their mother.  1) The court found that the petitioner's evidence all too frequently gravitated to what he considered to be his wife's transgressions and issues relating to money and other matters. It was also concluded that the children did not have a preference as to where they should live. 2) The respondent was 65 years of age and retired and had a successful career in the federal public service. He maintained a taxi driver's license and drove a truck on a part time basis. 3) The petitioner had obtained two university degrees and a career as a social worker. However, there was considerable disagreement between the parties regarding the custody arrangements and parenting arrangements. The court did not delegate the task of determining what is in their best interests. It generally provides the court with a recommendation based on her interviews. The judge's duty is to take into account all of the factors that are in the child's best interests, including the best interest and welfare of the child. It would be beneficial to the parties to have their children in their custody and to have the Court have jurisdiction to make final disposition with respect to all corollary issues and in particular the division of the parties' assets and debts."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence for the truth of their contents as an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence. The facts were relatively straight-forward and the complainant was the common- law spouse of the accused for seven years. She was upset and crying and asked the police to be called. The police arrived within minutes of the complainant asking that she call 911. The complainant was later found to have fresh red marks on her neck and chest, which corresponded to her description of the incident and she stated that the accused had punched her. She also stated that she wanted the accused to be removed from his bank card and that she was afraid that he was going to get into trouble. HELD: The test of reliability was met.  1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial at this stage.  2) The Court found that the test of necessity has been met. The evidence was evidence supportive of the trustworthiness of the statements made.  3) The statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to friend without guile and without any apparent guile. The accused's subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour was also considered to be an indicator of reliability.  4) The Crown was able to rely on the reliability of the first statements made to the friend. The fact that the friend was available at trial did not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts being breaches of s. 8 of the Charter. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was not contained in the authorization. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The Provincial Court judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization.  2)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. 3)The accused's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept authorizations was properly admitted by the trial judge. 4)The intercept evidence was non-conscriptive. 5)Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of ss.8 it was still relevant and ought not to be excluded. 6)The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and the relevant case authorities. It concluded that there was no Charter breach and that theevidence was in fact admissible and ought to be exclusion. 7)There was no evidence of bad faith, good faith, or conspiracy, or being an accessory after the fact or counseling procuring or inciting in relation to the offence. 8)The breach was not serious and was inadvertent. There was no breach beyond the scope of the s.271(1) authorization. The police intended to have the complainant initiate communication with the accused regarding their alleged sexual activity in anticipation of eliciting responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the alleged offences.  9)The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was to be minimal and admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The Estate applied for an order removing the respondent as personal representative. The respondent was an employed Marine Atlantic employee for approximately thirty-one years. During that period, he contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). The intestate determined that the respondent was not spouse within the meaning of the Pension Plan for Employees of the Corp. and the Pension Benefits Standards Act and therefore was not entitled to the survivor benefits. The Respondent, as Adminstratrix of the Estate, would be required to bring an action against herself in her personal capacity. The application failed. It is clear that the removal of Joan McGean as a personal representative is not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' or the Estate to pursue. It would only be so if the intended lawsuit with Marine Atlantic were feasible. It was not. The applicant was the spouse of the deceased when she was appointed as administrator of the estate. She was entitled to costs for the second day but these were offset by the expense she caused on the first date."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes.

The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's conclusion was supported by the facts. The appellant's belief was based on the observation that he was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the indicia of impairment. Even excluding the slurred speech, which the appellant was not certain if she had reasonable and probable grounds to make demand for a breath sample only minutes before she made the demand, the appellant's claim for breach of the Charter must fail."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed from this sentence. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender instead of a dangerous offender. For the reasons that follow, I dismiss the appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The judge was not bound to accept the experts' assessment. He was free to accept their assessment. 2) The defendant had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults and yet had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment which the experts acknowledge is pre-requisite for rehabilitation. The experts agreed that the defendant needed treatment before he could safely be released in the community. The court found that both experts agreed the defendant was a 'good person' who had provided a variety of responses when asked about his commission of the sexual assaults. However, the trial judge did not accept the defendant's assertion that he was 'well-behaved in the prison environment' which was supported by the evidence. The trial judge was also free to take other steps to reduce his risk of re-offending, which he did not have before the sentencing hearing."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The plaintiff union and its representatives republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The union and the Hospital both appealed. Appeal allowed; fixed damages at $100,000; the trial judge erred by failing to find that the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. The plaintiff's action was dismissed and a provisional award of $25,000 was fixed at $50,000. The court reviewed the history of labour relations and found that defamed words had a neutralizing effect on their appeal, as the words in the grievance were published, destroying any possible claim that the Union might have to absolute privilege. It was also found that the words expressed by the Union were entirely unfounded and without substance. In this case, the plaintiff's defamation claim was not proven, as it was not supported by the evidence, nor was the defence of qualified privilege proven. There was no basis by which the judge could have concluded that the plaintiff had in fact been defamed by the publication of the statements."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN, applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that matters relating to railcars previously loaded by CN were not within the Proper Scope of questioning. Prior to undertaking 28, Clarke advised CN that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and if they developed a position they would advise the plaintiff. Clarke provided to the date of their questioning their position and the facts they were aware of prior to the train being loaded by Clarke. It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. 2) Given the history of these 445 cars, it is reasonable to expect that answers to these questions cannot be provided until completion of the questioning of CN. 3) The plaintiff is also required to provide answers to questions which it would have preferred to have answered on its own. The Court was unable to find much to assist the plaintiff in saying that the application was premature and unnecessary. The approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailments is of such nature and scale that it is not appropriate. There is nothing to indicate that the defendant is waiving any claim of privilege as regards the sources of information leading to the sketch.  4) The claim for damages is not an issue at all. The history of the 445 cars is, as it was in question, a matter of fact and relevant information. The plaintiff's burden to prove its damages lies ultimately with a defendant not a plaintiff. A defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so."
d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.","The parties were self-represented at a case management conference. At that time the Sykes indicated they were going to be making an application to have portions of the action struck. The plaintiff amended claim to claim damages from overhanging trees on their property. The amended claim was successful and the parties were allowed to self-represent. HELD: The portion of the plaintiff's amended claim that was struck was allowed to proceed. The court found that the claim was frivolous or vexatious and that it did not disclose a reasonable cause of action. The claim for damages from falling trees was not frivolous. Even if the plaintiff could prove that the debris in his yard was not solely from the sykes' trees, this would not be sufficient. The issue was whether this was a case involving the law of private nuisance. As rule damages are awarded where roots damage property either by falling onto it, breaking it or hanging over it and causing damage. Damages are not awarded for trivial annoyances unless special circumstances justify it. The tort of nuisance is defined as unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of a property. Nuisance claims involving trees result in damages where the effects are outside whatever is reasonably expected based on community standards. This is a field of liability that focuses on the harm suffered rather than on prohibited conduct. There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that the burden on the plaintiff is greater than expected for the community he lives in. The matter was adjourned to resume the case manager conference in October 2014 at 10:30 a.m. Costs were to remain for the trial judge."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring for sale to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications for the processing of the product, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The appellant argued that the tax paid should not have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. The Commissioner allowed the objection in part and indicated that rebate of $14,467.43 would be paid to Continental. At issue was whether the tax should be refunded or not. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services taxed was upheld. 1)The practice of apportionment of tax on a prorated basis had been rejected in Silver Spoons Desserts. It was not appropriate to allow additional grounds to be raised at the same stage as the procedural deficiencies were addressed.  2)In the circumstances the Provincial Tax Commissioner's decision to allow a refund was not fair to the appellant but was appropriate in the absence of procedural deficiencies the appellant may have felt were appropriate. 3)The respondent was awarded his costs."

Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the respondent was ordered to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. HELD: The application was dismissed.

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter.

When the hospital staff arrived at the hospital, the appellant had gone to the emergency department where a patient had received a telephone call from a doctor who had advised him that his condition was not previously reported. Upon receiving the report, the doctor had taken specific medical information about the appellant without his consent, contrary to an explicit refusal by the appellant to provide a blood sample under any circumstances.

He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy pursuant to s. 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.

He had yet to file monthly financial statements and had not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the estate. One of the conditions for the financing is that the bankrupt get out of bankruptcy. 3)The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted.

HELD: Interim custody was granted to the respondent with access to the primary residence and to the child maintenance person. 1)The respondent was 31 years old and was employed as unit secretary at the General Hospital. She remained at home with the child for the first year after his birth and then returned to work at the hospital. She had only permitted herself to see the child on two occasions for four hours on each occasion. The respondent was to have access on the third day of his workday. 2)The Court found that the respondent was capable of caring for the child and accordingly it was in the respondent's best interests to be in the custody of the child. 3)Sole custody was to be shared with the primary caregiver. The child care person shall be responsible for 75% of the monthly child care costs. 4)Costs were to be divided equally among the primary caregivers. 5)An interim custody order was entered into to ensure the child's health and well-being was met. 6)The petitioner was to pay costs to the second caregiver and the maintenance person until the date of her employment. 7)The court ordered that the petitioner's income be divided into two equal portions: 1)the petitioner shall have access pursuant to the interim custody arrangement and the child care plan for the three days he is off work each week. The court was also prepared to arrange access for the respondent to the day care person once her employment was complete."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Merle owning the trailer park and gravel pit operation. The operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, a beef operation, and a trailer park. The defendant sold the operation to a third party for $1,000,000. The parties agreed that the agreement only referred to the Fluid Milk Quota and that it should not be included in the calculation of the value of the farm as a going concern. The agreement provided that if the defendant sold any of the milk quota which it held in 1987, prior to December 3rd, 2003, it was obligated to divide the proceeds three ways. The plaintiff was to receive a share of the sale price. The third way was to incorporate a separate company and the shares of that company would be held by the parent company of which the three brothers were equal shareholders. The fourth way, as stated in the agreement, was to include the MSQ. The plaintiffs were to receive $33,800. The court was to refer to the brothers by name instead of by their respective company name. The defendants sold and purchased some MSQ under the new quota scheme. The primary issue was whether the agreement could be interpreted to mean that the parties were obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of the same quota and not all quota sold. The dispute turned on whether the third way involved a possible conflict of interest."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner agreed to a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320.67 and the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The agreement framed the Agreement as a lease, but the Agreement did not define it in that way. The trade-in did not equal the value of the advance payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $8,310.67).HELD: The application was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest. The primary incidents of ownership are use of a sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. 2)The parties treated the trade in as an advance payment (but the Agreement does not define a 'finance lease' in that sense) even though the value in the case was not a nominal amount. In the absence of evidence, the court could not determine whether it was a'substantial sum' as being the test employed in the Ontario Equipment case. 3)The agreement had many of the attributes of a lease. The owner was to have possession and the unrestricted right to use the spray sprayer (provided that he did not exceed 500 base hours annually). The base hours were high and it was reasonably expected that the annual usage would be less than the base hours; indeed, the Base hours were not exceeded during the first, and only, year of operation). It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence thereof.  4)Costs on the plaintiff's claim were awarded in accordance with s.55 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.  5)The defendant was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance because of exclusionary clause eight of the Agreement. The plaintiff was to be released from further liability for errors made in the previous two sales contracts. Case Credit's claim was barred by s.47 of the Act."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. They had two children out of this relationship. After separation, the appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. The respondent and the appellant separated in 1995. They moved to River Bourgeois where they took up occupancy in a residence owned by the appellant and her. The appellant and respondent, while not married, lived together in a 'common law relationship' (as they both described the relationship in their respective affidavits) for approximately 10 years. The relationship ended in 1995 with the appellant obtaining a mortgage on the home which she used to pay off matrimonial debts. In 1996, the respondent and appellant separated. They lived together until 1995, when they moved to Nova Scotia where they continued to live together as joint tenants until 1995 when they separated. In 1999, the appellants applied for a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. They brought an application for an order reading into s.2(g)(i), (joint tenant arrangement) and (finance) of their property. Application allowed; s.15(1) declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect; declaration suspended for twelve months. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the application, that a common law spouse is not unlike a spouse, recognized as an analogous ground in Andrews: the individual exercises limited but not exclusive control over the designation. Legislation which effects differential treatment between individuals or groups will violate this fundamental purpose. The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, had been revealed as inadequate at both practical and psychological level. The reality may be otherwise. The sanction of the union by the state through civil marriage cannot always be obtained. The law; the reluctance of one's partner to marry; financial, religious or social constraints may result in partners who otherwise operate as family unit from formally marrying. The dramatic increase in the divorce rate after 1968 was undoubtedly the principal factor motivating the need to find 'orderly and equitable' ways to settle ex-spouses' financial affairs. The application was dismissed. In Nova Scotia, the legislature passed two acts, the Family Maintenance Act (MFPA) and Matrimonial Property Act (MPA). The MPA did not apply to the appellant because they did not come within the definition in s.(m) of"
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused's husband was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235. The Crown tendered statements by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents of choking. The defence argued that s. 589 of the Criminal Code should be considered bar to the admissibility of the accused's statement to the police concerning the charges of October 17, 2003. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the publication of the statements was prohibited until after the trial and after the appeal period had expired and until further order. 1) The Court must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissiblilty on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. 2) There must be some evidence capable of reasonably supporting finding that the appellant was implicated in the other similar acts committed. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of several hearsay statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial."
e_2007skqb225.txt,"The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. (1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharges in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. (2) The sentencing judge failed to meet the explicit provisions of ss. 737(5) and (6) of the Criminal Code. This is particularly true where the respondent has not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 730(5). Allowing the appeal, that the sentencing judge has consistently and consistently raised the issue of undue hardship and that the entire sentencing system plays an important role in ensuring that all victims of crime are adequately paid. This important evidence has been consistently raised by the court in an effort to ensure that the offender has paid the surcharge."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff's claim is grounded on a provision of the Union's by-laws which reads: 12.1 a) Defending an action or proceeding against Union officer claiming liability on the part of that Union officer for acts or omissions done by the Union officer in the course of his/her duties or paying any sum required to settle the action; b) Damages and costs awarded against union officer as result of the finding of liability pursuant to the indemnity by-law; and c) Exhausting internal remedies. The dispute in the Fourth Action involves a contractual debate concerning the meaning and scope of an indemnity clause. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. Nothing in the Union by-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making a final appeal to the CUPE National office. In the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts, an application for summary judgment is warranted."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 37 years and had two children (ages 12 and 13). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support based on the evidence of the petitioner and the respondent. The petitioner argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The respondent argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. Application dismissed; the court has jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the petitioner's older child. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct and the fact that the petitioner had not disclosed any material change in circumstances did not change the respondent's belief that his/her support obligation was being met."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The issue in this appeal was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision of the Board of Revision regarding the adjustment of the sale price of the shopping mall. The mall was owned by the appellant company, HDL Investments. It was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed the assessment to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found nothing requiring the Assessor to either exclude the sale from consideration in calculating the MAF or to adjust it beyond the adjustments he had already made. The company applied for leave to appeal under s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, S.S. 1988-89 c. M-23.2. The appeal was dismissed on the basis that the Committee misinterpreted or misapplied the importance, generally, of the sales verification information and the information it yielded. For the purpose of the assessment, the Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) While the Committee relied heavily on the sale verification information in upholding its decision that the sale of the Southland Mall qualified for inclusion in the array of sales from which the Market Adjust Factor (MAF) was derived, it did not misapprehend the importance generally of the Sale Verification Information and its information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on the information at his command, including the information supplied to him by the parties to the transaction. Hence the Committee was not convinced that the assessor erred. 2) Even assuming the Committee's decision in law gives rise to a question of law and not of fact the Committee found no material error. 3) The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6, namely that it represented the fee simple interest in the property, did not include atypical financing or other conditions of sale, and was not in breach of his responsibilities by failing to include the sale sale price in the calculation of the MAAF. 4) It was in reliance upon s. 171 and s. 172 of The Cities Act which enable municipal tax assessors to gather information they need to perform their assessment duties and are called upon to consider the conditions that affected the value of the property."

The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age.

HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act.

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.

Romania charged him with criminal negligent homicide and leaving the scene of an accident. He applied to be released pending the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania. The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused’s application to be frivolous and that his failure to abide by his obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement did not displace the well-established risk of non-appearance that is inherent in extradition applications.
