Accordingly I must and do take the law to be that in order for a certificate of analysis under paragraph 258(1)(g) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. Under the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I find that the approved instrument is not adequately identified as to make and model by means of the certificate.

4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children.

Given the lack of financial disclosure by the petitioner, am not prepared to vary the terms of that agreement.  3) There was nothing in the evidence before the court sufficient to rebut that presumption. The court must be satisfied additional money is actually available and that it can be paid to the shareholders without endangering the financial viability of the company. The status of the children is of limited assistance. Retained earnings are shareholder's 'equity' in the corporation (its assets less its liabilities).

Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy.

[7] The Residential Tenancies Officer stated in his reasons that based upon his reading of the Residential Tenancies Act, the Landlord “may not deny the tenant’s request that the lease be changed from a year to year lease to a month to month effective September 1, 2009.” In so failing to consider the Landlord’s reasons, I believe that the Residential Tenancy Officer erred in law. It places the Landlord in the centre of a consenting process and allows the Landlord to exercise some judgment, with the constraint that it not be arbitrary or unreasonable. [13] The reasons of the Landlord here are that, in his experience, this particular flat is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1, which has become almost a standard moving day in south end Halifax, in part because that is the start day for most student apartments. [17] In the result, I allow the appeal and declare that the tenancy has not been converted into a month to month tenancy, because the Landlord refused his consent in a timely manner, for reasons that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable. [22] The Landlord wants the lease to terminate on August 31, 2010, but to alleviate hardship he has unconditionally undertaken to accept an early termination on any date from May 31, 2010 (his undertaking refers to 2009, but I believe that is a typo) until August 31, 2010.",0.5915966386554622,"This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord effectively refused to renew for another year. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the tenancy has not been converted into a monthly to month. The reasons for the refusal by the landlord are that the lease is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1. In the unique circumstances of this case, it is appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk.  1)The lease has been renewed for one year and expires in August 2010. The landlord has the advantage of the landlord's undertaking to accept an early termination. Also, the tenant has the ability to sublet, if he determines that he wants to leave early. 2)An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it. The risk of vacancy falls on the tenant. The tenant is entitled to make a reasonable business decision and not be second guessed by tenants, Residential Tenancy Officers or Adjudicators simply because they do not agree with him.",0.5037037037037037

There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated.

The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The admission of the evidence would not affect the fairness of the trial.

In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff was responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its action against the defendant. The defendant was an Indian Band within the meaning of the Indian Act and the Councilor of the said Band was the appropriate representative of Ochapowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant; the plaintiff was unable to obtain the information from other persons as there were no persons the defendant was entitled to examine without the requested Order; and it was in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim. Awarding the defendant its costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered payable in the cause. The costs awarded are pursuant to Column of this Court's tariff of costs and must be paid within 30 days. If the parties disagree respecting costs, the same are referred to the Local Registrar.","[1] The defendant, Ochapowace First Nation (“Ochapowace”), applies for the dismissal of the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. As did the trial judge in the ICC second decision, I find and conclude that a delay in excess of five years in advancing this case does constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. Accordingly, the case is ready to and can proceed to trial without further delay and it should do so. CONCLUSION [41] Weighing all the relevant facts, which I have, and sensitive to the on the ground realities of litigation with the aim of achieving a result which is just, I have concluded that this is not a case where the application for dismissal for the plaintiff’s want of prosecution of it should be granted. I have concluded that it is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim.",0.4556213017751479,"The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The plaintiff was awarded costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the finding of inordinate and inexcusable delay. The defendant sought an order returning $40,000.00 paid by Ochapowace to McDiarmid and retained by the latter to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. HELD: The application for dismissal was granted. 1)The delay in advancing the action does not constitute an inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. 2)The plaintiff's delay in pursuing its claim does not reach the level of'serious prejudice' having regard to the factors considered in the ICC case. 3)The defendant was not entitled to recover the costs of its action.",0.40842105263157896

HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite.

The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood. The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised a number of issues which were summarized as follows: 1) Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. He was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. 2) The Court found the accused was 'in care' of the motor vehicle pursuant to the presumption in s.258(1)(a). The court found that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care and control of the vehicle. The Court concluded that the officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the victim and he wisely waited until medical personnel made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. 3) The accused failed to demonstrate his s.10(b)(c) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. The court held that the Court must be mindful that he had previous experience as an emergency medical technician and would have knowledge of head and spinal injury trauma procedures, including head and neck trauma procedures. 4) The court concluded that there might not well exist circumstances, for instance, in which the accused might not have been able to fully understand his rights or fully exercise them when he in fact spoke to a lawyer.","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

The Department had struggled for six years to overcome the dysfunction in this family and the risks to the children, without success. The children had been and accordingly continue to be in need of protection as provided by s. 11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act.

c_1999skqb178.txt,"Custody, child support and division of matrimonial property were in dispute. The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial with the unfortunate result that these proceedings became an extended replay of past domestic arguments. HELD: Custody was granted to the father with access to the mother. Access was to commence January 1, 1998. The mother was adamant that the custody and access assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words. 1) The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity was established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record, and the voices have been properly identified. 2) The father had no redeeming excuse for such calculated, offensive and immature behaviour. He had exploited the children's unhappiness at every turn and incited and encouraged willful and unruly behaviour to suit his own purposes. 3) There were numerous conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There was really very little involving the mother directly. The parties were involved in aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and having regard in particular to the age and unwavering antagonism of the two eldest children, the father had made only one voluntary payment of $100 in January, 1998 and otherwise ignored the maintenance order until garnishees were implemented by the Maintenance Enforcement Office. He was to have access on his scheduled days off work. 4) There was no evidence that the father was seeking out disagreement, no matter how trivial. Only by hearing the tapes could the Court truly understand the petitioner's violent nature and her dysfunctional relationships with the children.","[1] Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.

3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","FIRE: The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operationand operated a family-owned farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant recommended to the petitioner that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. Relying upon the accountant's advice, the petitioner brothers invested in these partnerships. Over the years, the parties have sustained heavy ongoing losses which have resulted in the need for significant injections of capital contributions to the Partnerships. The petitioner's business losses have always been allocated equally among the partners and claimed by each of the partners as personal business losses on an equal basis. As a result, the defaulting partners have obtained the benefits of the partnership (in the form of reduced income taxes resulting from business losses) without paying for them. HELD: 1)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court to refuse to issue the receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. No adequate explanation has been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. In the circumstances, this act of bankruptcy has been proven.  2)The petitioner was indebted to the respondent in the amounts claimed. As I am satisfied that he has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they have becomedue. It is common ground that the respondent has paid nothing toward the partnership obligations since 1993. The facts relied upon by the Petitioners to prove indebtedness to them comprise the uncontroverted evidence as to the facts described above.  3)The Petitioners had proven to the satisfaction of the Bankruptcy Court that the petitioner had committed an act of bankruptcy within 6 months prior to the filing of the petition.","This is an application by the petitioners, Thomas

(a) he has ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they
become due, having ceased to make payments to the three
Petitioners in February and March of 1996, and continuing to
fail the Petitioners to the present date;

(b) he has made or caused to be made a fraudulent conveyance,
gift, delivery or transfer of his property, by causing or
permitting his interest in the Securities, comprising the

In 1985, the accountant recommended to the petitioner that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships, in order to derive certain tax advantages. Relying upon the accountant's advice, the petitioner brothers invested in these partnerships. Over the years, the parties have sustained heavy ongoing losses which have resulted in the need for significant injections of capital contributions to the Partnerships. The petitioner's business losses have always been allocated equally among the partners and claimed by each of the partners as personal business losses on an equal basis. As a result, the defaulting partners have obtained the benefits of the partnership (in the form of reduced income taxes resulting from business losses) without paying for them. HELD: 1)There was no extenuating circumstance which would warrant the Court to refuse to issue the receiving order. The material discloses the very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as a result of his refusal to pay the indebtedness owed by him. No adequate explanation has been offered by the petitioner for his failure to pay his partnership obligations.

4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. It also held that the court could not vary a final order on an interim basis pursuant to s.17.

Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A. Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? [35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances. [77] Turcotte J. also found that “there was no unreasonable delay on Mandy’s part in seeking a retroactive review of Daniel’s child support obligation” (para. 48). [78] The appeal is dismissed.",0.6403162055335969,"HELD: The court found that the respondent had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order as it was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement. The court ordered the respondent to pay retroactive child support in the amount of $21,645 to be paid in installments of $601.25 for 36 months. The respondent applied to the Court of Queen’s Bench for a variation of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order to reduce child support to the children of his former marriage. Turcotte J. found the 2008 variation order to be an interim order, which had implications for the interpretation of the 2011 variation order. The parties agreed to fix support by varying a previous order in 2012. The appellant appealed. He argued that the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. HELD: Whether the Court can vary an interim or final order on a child support is governed not by common law principles but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985. 1) The court held that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear line between interim order and final order. In the case of the appellant, the Court held that the appellant erred by misapprehending the facts when he found the appellant did not advise the appellant of changes to his circumstances. 2) The appellant had not been advised of changes in circumstances. 3) The appeal was dismissed with costs of $1,500 to be awarded to the appellant. 4) It was important not to confuse the two lines of authority as to whether the court could vary the 2010 Variation order with respect to arrears arising prior to it issuing.

A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody with the parties to allow them to deal with service issues. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since December 2012 when the petitioner filed an Answer and Counter-Petition contesting the respondent's claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, the request for restraining order and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z. with primary residence and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time. The parties had been locked out for six months.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.23859649122807014,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.

To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been in an intimate relationship for some time. The petitioner claimed under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], sole custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time for the respondent, restraining order against the respondent and costs. The respondent claimed division of property under The Family Property Act (F-6.3), joint custody of T. and S. with primary residence of Z. and access for Ms. J. and Mr. S. respectively. HELD: 1) The Court found that the parties had not spoken since the parties’ separation. 2) The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference. It ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on/week-off basis. 3) The parties were to have a provisional agreement to tide things over until trial could be held. 4) There was no evidence that the petitioner telephoned the respondent to try and get him to return to her house. 5) The petitioner had not seen Z. since December 2012. She was concerned that he was in constant pain and that he had developed a quick temper tantrum. 6) There were no verbalizations of his behaviour during the course of the relationship.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.3485967503692762,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.

The plaintiff Seeds purchased specialty crops from producers and contracts with purchasers for the resale of these crops. To secure the product for resale, Johnson Seeds entered into contracts with growers prior to the seeding and harvesting of the same.

HELD: There was a valid contract between the plaintiff Seeds and Johnson Seeds. The contract was signed in May 1993 and both parties considered that there was a binding and legally enforceable contract. In addition to the fax, the plaintiff had used the mail to communicate the offer to Johnson Seeds and it should therefore have been in the reasonable contemplation of the plaintiff that he would receive back a fully executed copy of the contract. There was no doubt that in the telephone conversations he had with Calcutt in November and December 1993, he verbally confirmed that in his view a contract did exist. This as well was confirmed by the defendant. The defendant agreed to pay for the said seed in one of the following ways: The defendant may charge directly to the Producer any excess cleaning charges arising from delivery of Canaryseed containing in excess of 20% foreign material or other seeds which require special cleaning. There is no doubt in the defendant's testimony about these discussions that the defendant verbally reaffirmed that it was very important that payment be received in early January 1994.

The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion.

What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006.

The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not engaged in blameworthy conduct and that the annual increases of the payor parent's income over the years 2002 to 2005 were not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category.","[1] The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of Mr. Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999, and December 7, 1999, and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July, 2003. [3] The order of Kraus J. dated September 10, 1999 is hereby restored pending the determination of the issues by the Court of Queen’s Bench. 1) The respondent’s claim to retroactive support commencing July 1, 2004, a date the respondent advances rather than July, 2003. I cannot find any reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380.00 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July, 2003 until July, 2006. The respondent argues that the failure to disclose her tax returns on June 30, 2004 and each subsequent year constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. I have found that there was no such agreement or obligation to disclose. An increase of these proportions would not lead me to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children’s support in a satisfactory manner. [30] When considering the circumstances of Meghan and Ryan over the same period of years, 2003 to 2005, no evidence was provided that their standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. [32] I do not find the petitioner’s conduct blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would, in my opinion, represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category. I, therefore, dismiss the respondent’s application for retroactive child support.",0.37922077922077924,"HELD: The application was dismissed.

Further, the sentences imposed by the trial judge were not demonstrably unfit. [32] The conviction appeals and the sentence appeals are dismissed.",0.5784313725490197,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. He appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter were too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons. 1)The jury was alerted to the appellant's allegations that he had left Saskatchewan at the end of April 2002 and that someone else had driven the Tempo and had been operating the grow-op. The trial judge reviewed the evidence and concluded that the appellant could have outrun the police officer. 2)The appellant was not persuaded by the Crown's argument that the photographs were of the appellant and that, in the course of her charge, the trial judge suggested the jury might wish to consider whether, with two or three second head start after the car chase, Mr. Holoboff could have successfully outrun Constable Badger. The jury was advised that the Crown was entitled to introduce both pictures because both had been shown to the complainant before the search. She did not believe the jury would see them as being mug shots. 3)The trial judge raised concerns about the appellant’s credibility. The appellant argued that the jury should have been led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement. 4)The appeal was allowed with oral reasons.","Disposition: Dismissed (Orally) [1] Following a jury trial, David Horkoff was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. [10] Mr. Horkoff grounds his argument on a number of concerns. They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op. However, the jury was alerted to them and we are unable to conclude that Mr. Horkoff’s convictions were unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole. It was open to the jury to consider, on a common sense basis, whether it was likely that Mr. Holoboff could have outrun Constable Badger. The trial judge’s caution about changes in physical condition over time adequately put that issue into a proper perspective. Assuming this is in fact a situation when an adverse inference could have been drawn, the trial judge was not obliged to instruct the jury that it must proceed to draw the inference. When the charge is considered as a whole, we do not believe the jury was in any way left with the impression that, if it concluded the photographs were of Mr. Horkoff, it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo.

The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination, which translated into the overpayment of taxes. Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the disposition of the appeal.

The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused pled guilty to three counts of fraudulently and without a colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of credit card to credit card users contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment with a global sentence of eight years and six months. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. 1)The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. 2)The accused was imprisoned but this had no effect on him. 3)There clearly was pre-meditation and careful planning in advance. Several other people were implicated in the criminal enterprise. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. The place from which the crimes originated demonstrated real arrogance on the part of the accused and real disdain for the administration of justice. 4)Costs of sentencing, as stated in the Code, are rehabilitation. The accused pleaded guilty.","COUNT 2 THAT HE, the said MICHAEL CHUDYK between the 25th day of November, A. D. 2006 and the 1st day of February, A. D. 2007 at or near Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did fraudulently and without colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of a credit card to credit card users contrary to Section 342(3) of the Criminal Code. COUNT 4 THAT HE, the said MICHAEL CHUDYK between the 16th day of February, A. D. 2006 and the 19th day of August, A. D. 2007 at or near Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defraud Saskatchewan Telecommunications of services and goods, of a value exceeding five thousand dollars, contrary to Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be eight years and six months. COUNT 2 Incarceration for two years and three months. COUNT 4 Incarceration for one year and six months, consecutive to the preceding sentence. COUNT 5 Incarceration for two years, concurrent with the preceding sentences. [13] The period of time in the years 2008 and 2009 that the accused spent on remand were brought about because of the time constraints which necessarily are a part of the process. For that period, he should receive a credit of double time. Accordingly, the credit should be one for one, or put otherwise, the time actually served on remand. In the result, there should be a credit of four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. Peguis Indian Band which held that s. 89(1) of the Indian Act was applicable and governed the issue he was required to consider. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. The purpose of the Act is not to remedy the economically disadvantaged position of Indians by ensuring that the innocent purchaser is protected provided he had no notice, whether the agreement complies with the Bills of Sale Act or not. 2)The assignment as such transferred to the plaintiff no rights in the choses in action which were recognised at common law. Its efficacy was based solely upon principles of equity, with the additional statutory right given to the assignee to bring action in his own name, instead of that of the assignor, against the debtor upon giving notice to the creditor. 3)The Court was of the opinion that under the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act an agreement which is not evidenced by writing and filed in compliance with section is void even against a party having notice (See Edwards v. Furniture Finance Corp., 1930 CanLII 426). 4)The appeal should be dismissed with costs if only on the simple ground that it was never in the contemplation of the parties to the assignment that the conditional sales agreements covered, as the parties knew, by the previous contract between Fagel and the defendant, should be affected by the subsequent assignment of the book debts.","THE COURT: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Bateman and Flinn, JJ.A. concurring.

Mr. Francis is an Indian, a member of the Eskasoni Band, and resides on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton. Section 89(1) states:

The learned trial judge concluded that the sum of $101,636.33 owing by the Shubenacadie Band to Mr. Francis and held at the Council office in the form of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust was the property of an Indian on a reserve.

Morelli, [2005] S.C.R. 343. 2.The burden of proof rests upon the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize his blood samples was invalid and that there was an infringement of his rights as guaranteed by s. 8 of the Charter.  2)There was a technical error which was not fatal to the warrant. There was a breach of the accused’s right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. As the accused was a section Charter right was breached, what is the appropriate action to be taken under s. 24(2)?",0.4826666666666667
c_1993canlii3443.txt,"This was an appeal of a decision which denied variation of a maintenance award where a lump sum had been previously ordered. The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances. Accordingly, the Family Court has jurisdiction to vary awards of lump sum child support made pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act.","This was an appeal from the decision of the Family Court concerning a lump sum payment made under the Children of Unmarried Parents Act. At issue was whether an order for payment of maintenance or expenses or respecting care and custody or access and visiting privileges has been varied after payment. The issue before the court was whether such an order could be varied. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Since the merger of the two courts, the designation of Supreme Court should be substituted for the reference in the statute to the County Court. The general principles favouring the claim must yield to the clear, specific intention of the statute and the order made under it. The case Gillis v. Soulis was not determinative of the issue as it did not deal with the issue of whether lump sum payments can be varied under the Family Maintenance Act. There is no power in the courts of Nova Scotia to vary such orders. They are unique creations of a particular statute, and the statute must govern. It is possible to arrive at this conclusion merely by considering the scheme of the Children's Unmarried Parent Act. However any lingering doubt is removed by s34, which states with finality that 'this Part', the part dealing with the father's civil liability to pay maintenance, is the successor legislation, 'this part shall not apply to any punitive father who has fulfilled the terms of any order made against him with respect to the same child under Part 1'."" 2)The court was unable to cite a case other than Ivey v. Muir in which lump sum orders under the old Children's unmarried parents Act have ever been varied before payment.","Judge Levy held a pre‑trial conference, at which time the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sum in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause.

Accordingly, the judgment for divorce is granted. 2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner. On the basis of the evidence before me, it is therefore appropriate Jude now be enrolled in the Montessori program. [31] Accordingly, I order Jude may be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program is able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program shall be paid, at this stage, by the petitioner. 3. To take the child, Jude Babich, to a speech therapist – brought by the petitioner. 4. To vary the existing parenting arrangements set forth in the decision of Megaw J. dated January 20, 2015 – brought by the petitioner.

The petitioner seeks to have his parenting time set rather than at the whim of the respondent. 5. To set the arrears of child and spousal support – brought by the respondent. [63] As a result of this agreement, the issue of arrears of support and enforcement of any arrears from the date of the order to today’s date is to await the conclusion of the pre-trial conference. Accordingly, this issue will be adjourned sine die. Either party shall have leave to have it returned before me upon providing two days notice.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The Court granted the application and ordered that the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. 1)The Court found no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. In the event the respondent was unable to transport either of the children to their hockey or learn to skate sessions, she shall notify the petitioner and he will be responsible for getting the child to the program. 2)The court found that in the circumstances the parties were in some disagreement regarding the parenting arrangements set forth in Megaw J.’s decision in January 2015. The parties had commenced construction on a new residence in Moose Jaw. The respondent did not agree with the child attending the Montessori program. However, she was of the view that the child was not yet fully potty trained.

Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","HELD: The Court granted the divorce in accordance with s. 8(1)(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. It deferred the issue of custody and access while they attempted to work out transitional issues with Doctor Landry. The parties entered into a Separation Agreement in 2004. The agreement purported to settle all matters between the parties and was to be incorporated into and form part of the Corollary Relief Judgement in this matter. The petitioner claimed 10 percent of his household expenditures at his tax deductions, using his house to do his administrative work, and using his savings to pay child support and spousal support. The father argued that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not reflect his net business income derived from self employment. HELD: 1) The court found that the parties had reached an agreement that reflected their true financial circumstances and valid agreement. 2) The Court found that it was unfair in that it did not ensure that the father was fully protected by overtly addressing mobility. 3) There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the parties ability to retain and instruct counsel. 4) There were significant changes in the life of the parties since the agreement was entered into.",[3] He seeks a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousal support. He seeks an increase in access. [112] The Petitioner is not pursuing a line of education which is built on her previous skills.

When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act.

The primary child protection concerns were advanced and alleged that the original agency was planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling for the mother. The trial judge, based on the best interests of the child, extended the statutory deadline for the first disposition hearing and then conducted the trial which gave one of the dispositions authorized by Section 42 of the Act which disposition was to be reviewed within the statutory deadlines. Jurisdiction was lost. The court had not lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. It was only in the rarest of situations that the Court could have made an order after the trial wherein that best interest has been determined if that order would operate beyond any given statutory deadline.","I have before me a motion in this case under the Children and Family Services Act, S.N.S. 1990. c.5 (which I will hereinafter refer to as the ""Act"") by which the mother asks for a dismissal of this matter on the basis that I have lost my jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial date is after the outside disposition date provided in the Act.

He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was quashed.

F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders. [41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000. Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000. The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1.

[41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000. Accordingly, the defendant shall pay a fine of $5,000. The defendant shall also pay a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations, 1997, R.R.S. c. V-6.011 Reg. 1. The defendant shall have 60 days to pay the fine and victim surcharge imposed, and in default of payment shall serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.",0.4093264248704663,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The Court held that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 and Count No 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products, but he held that given the defendant's own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the wood he sold to the defendant and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he sold in 2008 and 2009) were wood coming from private lands. Thus, the appellant court should intervene if the decision is not correct in law unless there has been no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice that has occurred.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once.

But even if she does have “need”, and I have decided she does not, I believe it is useful to complete an analysis of the Father’s ability to pay. 5) The Father is to have final decision making authority concerning the children’s education and choice of child care facility or program. 6) The Mother is to have final decision making authority concerning the children’s regular health care (not including counseling) and dental care.",0.39169139465875374,"The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement. The father was the primary caretaker and the mother the primary caregiver. The mother sought joint custody and primary care with the father. The parties had lived together for a very short period of time and there had been significant changes in the children's lives. The Father was to pay child support of $502 per month. The Mother was to seek a reduction in the father's pension benefits. HELD: The court found that the information provided by the mother and her witnesses was credible and that the father was prepared to acknowledge the mother's involvement in parenting. There was no evidence that the children needed counseling because of anything their Father had done. The court was not prepared to modify the child support amount where, considering the financial realities of the parents, it would lead to significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they moved from one household to the other.",0.3789473684210526

The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction.

The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","HELD: The appellant was released from custody pending appeal of his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The Crown opposed release on the grounds that the appellant was a flight risk. The appellant had no prior criminal record, substantial assets, favourable pre-sentence report and had been on bail for 16 months without incident. He proposed that he be released on an undertaking to appear. He alleged the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant's condominium and failed to grant remedy as result. He also argued that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded handgun to the door in all the circumstances. He argued that the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. He contended that his release was necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice and that his proposed release plan was wholly inadequate. The court ordered the appellant released on a recognizance in the amount of $25,000 with the following conditions: 1) that he surrender his passport. 2) He surrender into custody in accordance with the terms of his release. 3) The Crown did not allege that the grounds of appeal were frivolous. The appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous. It is preferable that no more be said concerning the merits of the appeal.","Held: Motion granted.

Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue.

If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.

Otherwise, the Crown and the court are entitled to proceed on the basis that no Charter issue is involved in the case.  2)The court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. The court found that in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. This is different for trial court which hears cases that have been through preliminary inquiry and detailed pretrial, and that regularly assigns trial judges to cases well before the date of trial. 3)In Provincial Court, it will be for the trial judge to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclude is made.

In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.

Conclusion [33] The appeal against the conviction is dismissed.",0.49450549450549447,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in his decision to exclude the evidence of the Crown's defence counsel concerning the appellant's slurred speech as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count. 2)The appellant did not rely on conjecture or speculation as suggested by the counsel for the appellant. The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility because of the extreme danger represented by unlicensed or impaired drivers on the roads. 3)There was nothing in the record to indicate that there was any inherent improbability in her evidence or any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with the findings of the trial judge. There was some support for her testimony in other evidence which was accepted by the judge.","[1] This is a summary conviction appeal from a judgment dated September 17, 2010, wherein the learned Provincial Court judge convicted the appellant of impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000.00 and prohibited him from driving for one year.

The appellants argued that the judge erred in allowing the respondent to amend his defence to withdraw certain admissions he made. The judge allowed the application and granted leave to the appellant to appeal. The appellant appealed. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted and the appeal dismissed. 1)In the circumstances of this case, new counsels need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts is a strong reason for concluding that it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. There are no equities weighing significantly against the justice of the defendants’ request. There was no agreement or undertaking between the appellants and the defendants. 2)The court found that the respondent had not erred by making his decision in the absence of evidence indicating that it was just to withdraw his admissions. 3)The Court found that new counsel was not required to defend the admissions made by the respondent in this case. 4)The respondent was entitled to copies of any and all offers, if any, he would be entitled to. 5)The judge did not err in permitting the applicant to amend its defence. The words used in clause of the order were that the rights of the respondent as a shareholder “are hereby suspended.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting a summary judgment on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. The Chambers judge committed no error in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute and it was incumbent on him to make the determinations of law arising from those undisputed facts. The lease agreement was assigned to Chrysler. The plaintiff was involved in an accident which resulted in personal injuries to the defendant. The appeal turned on the interpretation of two provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, s. 62(1) and s. 2(ak). The plaintiff argued that the lease agreement fell into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner' and that the insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal. The appellants argued that s.62 can be applied so as to impose liability in circumstances such as the one described in Gordon Capital where the plaintiff's claim for vicarious liability against the insurer had a different result. The issue before the Chambers judge was whether the chambers judge correctly cited the test and whether he erred in his application. The court concluded that the issue of whether liability should lie against the employer, rather than obscuring the decision beneath semantic discussions of'scope of employment' and'mode of conduct', was one of the issues to be addressed.","Summary: The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting summary judgment to Chrysler on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin.

The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent Chrysler on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin.

9_2013skca85.txt,"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. The trial judge awarded the mother custody of the parties' son to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the regular school year and for one half of major school breaks, with each party to share and assist in the transportation of their son for the purposes of access. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern. HELD: The application was granted. 1)It is not possible to conclude that the child can be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way. From the time that Mackenzie was essentially abandoned by both parents until he was 10 or 11 years old, both of his grandparents abdicated their parental responsibilities in favour of his grandmother, Patricia.

McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors.

These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit and that evidence of clients using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool was so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the plaintiff. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against the appellants on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. HELD: The proposed appeal was granted or withheld in the amount of $23,000. 1)The facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of caring to a non- client and the evidence of Mr. Davies establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of the Class Actions Act. 2)Nothing in the Chambers judge's reasons suggests he applied a rules-based analysis when determining whether'some basis in fact' supported the existence of a recognized 'duty of care' within the meaning of s. 6(1)(c) of the Act. No common issue existed upon which class action could reasonably be certified. 3)The proposed appeal is prima facie destined to fail and not of sufficient merit to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.","Disposition: Applications Dismissed They also opposed the certification of the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. [2] The learned Chambers judge dismissed the s. 173(c) application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. [3] McMillan then applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, S.S. 2000, c. C-42.1 and Rule 49 of The Court of Appeal Rules for an order granting them leave to appeal from the Chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. [14] With respect to the first question, I am satisfied the Chambers judge correctly held the action against McMillan was not devoid of merit or vexatious. Based thereon, he concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including circumstances akin to those before him. In his opinion, evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. [20] While McMillan conceded the cause of action in negligence pled by the representative plaintiff met the requirements of s. 6(1)(a) of The Class Actions Act, they maintain the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff does not establish a common issue which meets the commonality requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act. In the instance action, class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan’s negligence. These facts, coupled with case law stating a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the evidence of Mr. Davies, establish a common issue which appears to meet the requirements of The Class Actions Act. In my view, the Chambers judge made no error in his interpretation of the applicable law or the evidence before him, or in his application of the law to the relevant facts before him, which would warrant leave being granted based on arguments advanced by McMillan. [23] In conclusion, I dismiss both applications for leave with costs to be costs in the cause.",0.6480117820324007,"The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the ground that it was devoid of merit and that evidence of clients using legal opinions provided by their legal counsel as a marketing tool was so commonly known among tax lawyers that McMillan should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against their opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the plaintiff.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of a firearm contrary to s. 8 of the Criminal Code and possession with intent to sell. The accused had not been on the arrest list at the time of his arrest. The evidence led by the Crown established that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms and ammunition. The intercepts were also of crucial importance to the firearms trafficking charges. HELD: The accused was found not guilty.  1)The accused could not assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the interest resided. 2)There was nothing to the continuity/integrity of the exhibits. Reasonable doubt was based on reason and common sense and is logically connected to the evidence or lack thereof.","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.2537764350453172,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

The evidence did not support his Charter application. 3)The essential issue was whether the accused had constructive possession of any of the firearms seized from him at the time of his arrest.

However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.2616451932606541,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused was charged with possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm pursuant to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a loaded prohibited weapon pursuant to ss. 8 of the Code. The accused was also charged with trafficking firearms. HELD: The accused were all found guilty. The essential issue on the charges against the accused was whether they had constructive and/or joint possession of the loaded Mark II rifle, the loaded Cooey sawed-off shotgun, and the loaded AP 9 handgun.  1)The accused were found guilty of possession of firearms and ammunition contrary to both s. 8 and s. 9 of the code.  2)The evidence was found to support the accused’s Charter application in relation to the firearms. The evidence did not support his Charter application. 3)The essential issue was whether the accused had constructive possession of any of the firearms seized from him at the time of his arrest.  In due course, the accused will address the law and evidence relating to the charges.","Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges.

1. The petition for divorce is a nullity and Saskatchewan courts do
not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce
proceedings;

2. The court lacks, or ought to decline to exercise jurisdiction
under The Children\'s Law Act, R.S.S. 1990, c.C-8.1; residence. On the affidavit evidence before me it is clear that
by June 1996 the parties were at odds with respect to Stefan\'s
residence and I find that the respondent did not acquiesce to
Stefan\'s residing in Saskatchewan such that it may be said he was
habitually resident in Saskatchewan for the purposes of The
Children\'s Law Act. Both sets of grandparents reside in Regina and it
appears they will have a role to play in the disposition of these
proceedings. I find that the child
has a real and substantial connection with Saskatchewan and it is
appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in Saskatchewan. As a
result the court has jurisdiction pursuant to section 15(1)(b). In
the event the court did not have jurisdiction under 15(1)(b) I would
find jurisdiction to exist pursuant to 15(3) as the child
clearly has a closer connection to Saskatchewan than to Alberta. There will be an order that Stefan shall
reside with the petitioner on an interim basis and the petitioner
shall have care and control of Stefan. It is a condition of this
order that Stefan and the petitioner shall continue to reside
with the petitioner\'s parents in the city of Regina. It is a condition of this order that Stefan
shall not be removed from the city of Regina without further
order of this court.",0.6021052631578948,FIAT. The petition for divorce was a nullity and Saskatchewan courts did not have jurisdiction to hear and determine the divorce proceedings.

The child had no connection of any consequence to Alberta.  3)There was substantial conflict in the affidavit evidence.

2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.

The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 2)The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on a prosecution of April 8th events if it supported an inference that the accused is in possession of that firearm on that date. If this were to be a trial by jury, severance on that basis would be appropriate because of the risk of propensity reasoning by the trier of fact. There is no such risk in having all the counts tried together and further delay would thereby be avoided while he is in custody. 3)Sellance is required in the interest of justice, as per s. 591(3) of the Code. The interests encompass a multiplicity of offences having little legal or factual nexus. The issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and there is no common evidence. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. It is argued that it would be unjust for the accused to be placed in the position of wanting to testify with respect to the April 8 and April 14th but not in respect of the April 15th events.

The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: The residence status quo in this case is Regina and the child shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is that the child has a strong bond with both parents and Lesly's support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. However it is fair that Mike contribute something to this cost. Costs in the cause. 1) There was no compelling reason to allow mobility in the case merely because the mother has made some unilateral decisions about her education. 2) Lesly had chosen to relocate to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly. She applied as primary parent. She was involved in feeding, teaching and dressing the child and shared other parenting duties. The issue of mobility was clearly unresolved. 3) The respondent was to pay to Lesly for each occasion that the mother travelled to Victoria. She had made choices which resulted in greater expense to insure that the kaira sees both parents. Accordingly, the cost of transporting the child to and from Victoria shall be borne primarily by Lesly and the petitioner. The petitioner was to provide telephone access to the child every second day at 7:00 p.m. Regina time during Lesly’s parenting time and 7:30 a.m Victoria time during her parenting time. 4) Costs to the cause were to be determined by reference to Gordon v. Goertz (1996), 1996 CanLII 191 (4th) 321, which are well known and which are germane to the case. 5) The status quo was the attachment the child had with the primary parents and that is Lesly but there was a compelling reason for the status quo to be maintained unless there were compelling reasons not to do so.","[1] This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2 ½ years old.

e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was employed as a clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and she assumed her position in 1999. She testified that she met the accused in the office of the Justice of the Peace in the same building. HELD: The Court concluded that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the Charter had been infringed. The Court found that the Court believed that allowing the Crown to use the statement to cross-examine the accused was tantamount to allowing the accused to enter the statement as evidence and, in that manner, to allow the Court to split its case.","[1] Mr. Toupin is charged that, on or about the 21st day of August, A.D. 2003, at or near[…], Saskatchewan, he did commit a sexual assault on T.D. contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code.

on the whole, slanderous. The negligence claim against Helene C. and
Helene C. Counselling Inc. is dismissed. I do not think there is need for further deterrence
now. CONCLUSION Judgments for the plaintiffs against all defendants,
jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000.00. Judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendant
K.T. in the amount of $1,000.00. Judgment for the
plaintiffs against the defendants Helene Christison and Helene
Christison Counselling Inc. in the amount of $15,000.00.",0.2377260981912145,HELD: The Court dismissed the application to vary the custodial arrangements and ordered the trial to be held in Unified Family Court. The Court found that the allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice and that the co-defendants libel the plaintiffs by publishing each of the four reports thus causing damage to their reputations.,0.1912350597609562

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life Insurance claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class. It is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision.","[4] In its application Ag Credit takes the positions that:
a. The funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses are the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown’s agent;
b. Since no other person has a competing interest to Ag Credit’s right and title, the interpleader order sought by Empire Life is unnecessary; [24] Without limiting the scope of arguments that will ultimately be advanced by any party, I have decided, for the reasons outlined below, that I will be appointing a representative party to advance the case and interests of the insured clients class. [25] Given my conclusion that insured clients under the Policy have an arguable claim to the surpluses in question and since Ag Credit maintains its claim to these same funds, this is an appropriate case to grant interpleader relief under Rule 6‑75 of The Queen’s Bench Rules. Conclusion [37] The decisions I have made herein can be summarized as follows:
a. I dismiss Ag Credit’s application for an order that the surplus funds be paid to it on the grounds I have categorized as peremptory basis claims;
b. Empire Life is entitled to some form of interpleader relief in respect of the surplus funds;
c. A representative will be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings to determine whom as between Ag Credit and those clients is entitled to the surplus in question;
d. In light of these decisions, I wish to hear further submissions from Ag Credit and Empire Life as to:

The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since.

Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be decided including what persons will be given notice of the proceedings. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. The phrase 'public money' is not found within Ag Credit's Act. The argument that since by definition any monies received by Ag Credit are public money within the meaning of the Financial Administration Act, 1993, they are also therefore 'Public money' under Ag Credit’s Act and thus Crown property for the present purposes is non-sequitur. 2) While the insured clients’ class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as class are entitled to receive the surplus by virtue of the language of the Policy, the economic realities of the litigation necessarily involved needs to be recognized. 3) The insurer has acted in full compliance with its duty of uberrima fides in bringing the potentially valid claims of its insured clients to the attention of the Court and in resisting the claim that Ag Credit was entitled to a surplus. The insurer is willing to pay monies directly to the insurer. 4) It does not collude with any of the claimants. 5) Given the absence of clear direction in the policy and any legislation or Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines, it is reasonable to conclude that the surplus belongs to the insured client class. It is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision.",0.5108853410740203

The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions.

HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.",The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant did not contest the presence of water on the floor in the Superstore although it did not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. 3)The plaintiff had met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water in the store.,"[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000. The defendant places in issue:

(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and

(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store. [21] I conclude that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and is not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard upon the defendant in this case that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this Court in almost identical circumstances. [22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's claim is dismissed with costs.

The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000.

The expropriation resolution was filed at the Registry on September 7, 1993 and the effective date was September 8, 1993. The solicitor-client account was taxed in the amount of $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file. The notice and statement of claim was filed by the claimant with the Utility and Review Board under the Expropriation Act and certificates of readiness were filed by counsel and the Board set the matter down for hearing on November 14, 1994. The appellant appealed the decision of the Taxing Master to reduce the solicitor's account from $20,000 to $10,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs confirmed. 1)The appellant was correct that the failure of the City to include an item of compensation for injurious affection did not render the appellant's offer one of 'full compensation for interest'. 2)There was nothing in the decision to suggest that the taxing Master disallowed any services that were actually incurred. He simply concluded that the services, although actually incurred, were not reasonable in all the circumstances.  3)The taxing master was correct in stating that the initial offer made in an 'expropriation' was an initial offer and not necessarily or likely the final position of the appellant. The mere statement of an interest term on an invoice by itself raises no legal obligation for payment of such interest and he was correct to put even greater weight upon the expert's report recommending an appropriate fee for the legal services.","The solicitor\'s account was taxed by Arthur Hare and in a decision dated August 25, 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appeals from a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009. The hearing officer declared that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and that the hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order of possession of the rental unit. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Act applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. Those circumstances do not exist here and conclude that the Hearing Officer did not err in law in deciding that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 2) There was no valid tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord. The tenant was not at fault in this situation. He signed a lease in good faith and did not intend to act for his mother. He was acting for himself and asserting that he had that right. 3) The Hearing Officer erred by declaring that the landlord had not provided the tenant with a written agreement that substantially complies with the provisions of the tenancy agreement.  4) The tenant's obligation to pay rent is suspended if the landlord gives notice without the consent of all joint tenants. 5) The landlord may have remedies against the tenant for any damages he has suffered as a result of his dealings with the tenant. 6) The tenancy agreement is not invalid if the tenant fails to provide the information required of the landlord pursuant to s. 7(f)(i) or s. 8(f) of the Act. 7) It is just and equitable for an order to be made pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Code of Conduct. 8) In any situation where one person has so acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person to act on his or her behalf, and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person, it is in the public interest to hold a hearing.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a child together. The applicant claimed that the divorce settlement had left her deeply in debt and that following the settlement she felt the need to settle. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed, that there had been no material change in the circumstances of either party since it was signed and the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and there was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature. The additional income came from investment income and rental income that she received from a tenant who rents a basement apartment in her home as well as rent from boarder. The household expenses that the applicant claimed in relation to her rental income exceeded the actual rental income and there were no adverse tax consequences to receiving those monies. 2)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. 3)It was not necessary for the court to determine the agreement was unconscionable. The court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 4)The parties had signed an agreement in January 2003 that provided for an approximately equal division of matrimonial assets and debts. The assets received by the applicant exceeded in value the amount of her mortgage but that was offset by the respondent's assumption of debts far greater in value than the debts assumed by the Applicant.","[1] The Applicant, Marie-Louise Stening-Riding, has applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties’ Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003. At the same time as their divorce was granted a Corollary Relief Judgment was also granted which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties dated January 30, 2003. She proposed that the monthly support be increased to a figure that more closely resembles that which would be assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines and that she receive a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the “underpayment” of spousal support since the 1st of February 2003. [27] I find that there was no pressure exerted by the Respondent upon the Applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and I find further that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the Applicant as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). [35] Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, in determining the appropriate spousal support terms, one has to take into account a number of factors including the Respondent’s age, his health (which has not been good) and the reasonable expectation of retirement. The Applicant should have been aware that whereas she was in her late fifties when she received her doctorate the prospects of her obtaining a full-time teaching position at a university in the narrow field of her expertise were far from great. It was completely foreseeable that she would have difficulty and perhaps no chance at all of obtaining such a position. [47] The incomes of both parties have increased since the Agreement was signed but that too was a foreseeable event. I do not consider the increased appraised value of the Respondent’s real estate to be a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties’ Agreement. [54] In conclusion, the current circumstances of the parties are not a “significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties” when they signed their Agreement.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required.

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered.

If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her, using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat.

The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired. The plaintiff has not proven that the defendant breached the contract. The action is dismissed.","In 2006, Sturgis Meats entered into a contract with Gardon Securities. That contract covered both the installation of temperature monitoring equipment and the month to month monitoring of the temperature in the freezer and cooler at this business.

That monitoring is done by the Gardon staff in Yorkton, based on information transmitted by the monitoring equipment over a telephone line from the business.

It is possible that there was a so-called glitch in the monitoring system that resulted in no alarm being received by them on August 14, 2010 and no request for repair was ever received from this business after this incident; and the detailed computer records, which are unalterable, and the nature of the computer back-up system at Gardon, ensure that there is no breach of their contractual obligation. 2) The monitoring equipment was installed in the cooler and freezer of the business in January 2006 for the sum of $1,190.26 and was monitored by the plaintiff in the months leading up to that day.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT. The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001 to expunge child support arrears that had accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support and that, in the absence of a special circumstance, arrear arreages should only be expunged where the payee has established on a balance of probabilities that he or she cannot pay the child support payable in the amount of $9,000.  1) The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in basic child support, $249 per month in s. expenses and $2,589 in child support costs. 2) There was no undue hardship to the parties as the respondent was putting money away for his retirement. Almost every dollar that was taken from the respondent by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him was snatched away from him.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. I do not accept that assertion. Thabani suffers from a serious psychotic illness and has lived with the petitioner continuously. 22) In summary, I find that Mandela ceased to be a child of the marriage on June 30, 2002 and Bogani ceased being a child of the marriage on June 30, 2008 (June 30 being the approximate date of the end of the school year).

The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to.  2) The respondent had not been complying with any of the many support orders issued over the last 25 years and did not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. 3) The petitioner had struggled for 25 years to obtain child and spousal support. She was not very successful. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 per month. He knew that he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. Now, some 12 years later, he argues that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income. The fact remains that rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. 4) The Court found that although the respondent was not being paid, his child support obligations should not be based on his income over the years. He did not accept the assertion that he was incapable of paying child support. 5) There was no undue hardship to either party. The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support in the amount of $183,746.  6) The court ordered that he pay $9,562 under the March 7, 2001 order. The Court ordered that the petitioner make monthly payments on the $106,000 of debt that remains from that which she borrowed to support the herself and the children during the many periods of time that he stopped paying support. 7) The amount owed by the respondent to the petitioner was $58,000 after paying his living expenses in 2011.

As of April 30, 2013, the respondent’s arrears under the orders of Madam Justice Wilkinson dated March 7, 2001 and July 20, 1998 are fixed at $183,746. 4. The child Thabani remains a child of the marriage. 5. Commencing June 1, 2013 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order of the Court, the respondent shall pay basic child support in the amount of $927 per month.",0.48589341692789967,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent did not have the ability to pay child support because he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to.  2) The respondent had not been complying with any of the many support orders issued over the last 25 years and did not want the issue of child support to interfere with his plans. 3) The petitioner had struggled for 25 years to obtain child and spousal support. She was not very successful. He was adamant that he should not pay more than $2,000 per month. He knew that he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. Now, some 12 years later, he argues that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income. The fact remains that rather than seek employment that could pay him handsomely, he chose to flail away in private practice for years and earn much less than he otherwise would have. 4) The Court found that although the respondent was not being paid, his child support obligations should not be based on his income over the years. He did not accept the assertion that he was incapable of paying child support. 5) There was no undue hardship to either party. The respondent was ordered to pay $1,683 in monthly child support in the amount of $183,746.  6) The court ordered that he pay $9,562 under the March 7, 2001 order. The Court ordered that the petitioner make monthly payments on the $106,000 of debt that remains from that which she borrowed to support the herself and the children during the many periods of time that he stopped paying support. 7) The amount owed by the respondent to the petitioner was $58,000 after paying his living expenses in 2011. It is repugnant to even suggest that reducing child support should be done by means of garnishment or the interception of federal government monies.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. I do not accept that assertion. Thabani suffers from a serious psychotic illness and has lived with the petitioner continuously. 22) In summary, I find that Mandela ceased to be a child of the marriage on June 30, 2002 and Bogani ceased being a child of the marriage on June 30, 2008 (June 30 being the approximate date of the end of the school year).

The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision.

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city.

By ss. 10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-halffor every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week which has a public holiday. The provisions of the agreement are more favourable to the employee than the Act. HELD: The City's application is allowed and the certificate is amended to show that there are no wages due orowing to Albert Morgan. There will be no order as to costs. 1)Nothing in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act affects any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or custom insofar as it ensures to any employee more favourable conditions, more favourable hours of work or more favourable rate of wages than the hours of labour provided for by the Act or by any other Order or regulation. The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue. No holiday means no issue. 2)The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (the ""agreement"") it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act pay. Thematerials satisfy the Court that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the City paid Morgan 87 hours of pay over the Act's requirements for hours worked in week containing a holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours.","The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants were charged with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana. They were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. The Crown brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant's residence which resulted in the seizure of 365 plants and led to the present charges. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine was granted and the evidence obtained at the preliminary inquiry relevant to this application was admissible, subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence. This should not be considered a usurpation of the trial judge's function. Cross-examination will disclose facts to the accused but they will only become admissible at trial by leave of the judge.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant.

I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure.

Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (BC CA), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. The Court noted that the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code were no reason to grant leave to allow cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization of electronic surveillance using the same criteria set out by Sopinka J. in R. vs. Garofoli (1990), 60 C.D.

On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of a marijuana grow operation. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted when the trial judge is satisfied that the information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set aside on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. Preliminary Inquiry Evidence: The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), 1997 CanLII 3792 (BC CA), 12 C.R. (5th) 106. The Court noted that the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code were no reason to grant leave to allow cross-examination of police witnesses with respect to an authorization of electronic surveillance using the same criteria set out by Sopinka J. in R. vs. Garofoli (1990), 60 C.D. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.) at p. 198. The court found that the police did not try any investigative procedures available to them before applying for the authorization and as the matter was not urgent s. 186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.4511581067472306,"FIAT: The applicants, who are charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, plead not guilty to the charges.

The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

This would require total payments of about $12,000. This was an option open to her from 2007. Now with the amendments she would be required to pay surplus over 21 months.

The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","The accused is facing a 24-count indictment generally associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances and matters ancillary thereto.

2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. The only evidence led in the voir dire at the trial was that of the police officer who stopped the respondent in a routine traffic stop of vehicles entering Saskatoon from the east. The police officer determined that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the respondent was operating his motor vehicle while impaired, he arrested the respondent, read the respondent his right to retain counsel and gave the requisite police warning. The breathalyzer certificate was excluded. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent waived that right. HELD: 1) In reviewing the evidence that was before the learned trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did. Not only does this case have no comparison to the facts in R. v. Prosper, the evidence falls far short of proving that respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about 5 minutes. 2) An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee, who has previously asserted the right to counsel, indicates that he has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his rights to reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any process that would incriminate him. 3) The holding-off requirement flows logically from the two implementation duties. The trial judge concluded such a warning was required in this case and none was given to the respondent by Cst Lerat. That being so, the trial judge found a breach of the respondent’s rights under the Charter. 4) The Court must examine the evidence to determine whether the Crown had met the burden of establishing the respondent gave an unequivocal waiver when he changed mind about seeking legal counsel. 5) The lack of a Prosper warning does not mean that the Crown has not been advised of the existence and availability of the applicable systems of duty counsel and Legal Aid in that jurisdiction.

An additional informational obligation on police will be triggered once a detainee indicates that he or she has changed his mind and no longer wants legal advice. At this point, police are required to tell the detainee of his or her right to reasonable opportunity and of the obligation on the part of police during this time to refrain from having them participate in the process that would incriminate him.

[8] The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, I must conclude that the learned trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that Cst. Lerat had an obligation to provide a “Prosper warning” to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice.

After the police stopped the appellant in a motor vehicle stop of vehicle entering the east, the appellant attempted to telephone a lawyer but was unsuccessful. The police officer advised the appellant that he had the right to retain counsel, could contact any lawyer he wished, and could apply for legal assistance without charge.

The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The petitioner and the applicant agreed in 1994 that he would pay her $3,000 per month which included support for their son Michael as well as her. Since then the petitioner has reduced the monthly support to $1,000. Since the petitioner reduced the support to 1,500, even those were irregular and not on time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500.00 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $2,000 as noted above without at least consulting with the applicant. Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 at this point in time instead of the $4,000 she received. 2)The matrimonial home had been sold and it was expected each party would receive approximately $30,000 in early June when net proceeds were distributed. 3)There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There is the uncertainty of the petitioner's future job and income. There was no evidence asto what she will require if she does go touniversity this fall. There are uncertainty as to what the two children are going to do about future education. 4)The applicant sought interim support based on some maintenance guidelines suggested by the Government which when the petitioner and applicant's current income is taken into account indicates that the respondent should pay the applicant around $ 2,400 per month. 5)It was premature on this application to fix the amount of the maintenance that the applicanthas asked for at the suggested guideline figure. There were no unknown factors in either party's future economic situation. The respondent's future employment was uncertain. The applicant's income exceeded $80,000 annually but it must be noted that the status of his employment is that he is currently suspended with pay.

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to a construction contract of purchase and sale. The defendant corporation withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. Orion Morgan was to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. HELD: The simplified trial should proceed pursuant to Rule 269, the dissolved corporate defendant not being allowed to partake in the process. That would include not having either cross-examination of the plaintiffs' witness or to present its own case. The court found that the proper interpretation of s. 219(2)(a) of The Business Corporations Act is that the matter would and should proceed as if the corporation had not been dissolved and still existed. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans that were prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The dissolved corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the claim. The plaintiff corporation requested that the affidavit of Marilee Fehr be considered by the Court on its behalf. Ms. Fehr was listed on the defendant's affidavit of documents and witnesses dated August 10, 2011, as person who might reasonably be expected to have knowledge of transactions or occurrences in issue. More than two months have now gone by since the affidavit was provided to counsel for the plaintiffs and accordingly the strength of any argument of plaintiffs being taken by surprise with the content of any last minute affidavit has been substantially diminished. The Court is not prepared to follow the decisions of other provinces that have found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces.","On June 21, 2012, a conference call was held with the parties at which time a request was made to myself as the trial judge, by Orion Morgan that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of The Queen’s Bench Rules.

(a) Does the Court have jurisdiction to hear this simplified trial?

(b) What is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?



(c) What is the appropriate process during the simplified trial? [6] As agreed by both parties, this Court has jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial despite the defendant corporation being dissolved as at June 20, 2012. [23] The Court has therefore concluded that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness not only should this trial be allowed to proceed against the dissolved defendant corporation but that the dissolved corporate defendant should be allowed to defend the action commenced before its dissolution. Accordingly, on September 5, 2012, the following process shall be implemented during the simplified trial:


1. Orion Morgan shall be permitted to represent the defendant corporation during the simplified trial pursuant to Rule 10(2).

2. Wayne Chalazan shall be produced for the purpose of cross‑ examination.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff decided to purchase a home. She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year, the plaintiff purchased the property. The property did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants. 1) The property was not within her means. The realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. 2) The plaintiff was not the only one experiencing problems with her home. The defendant's realtor also misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home and in answers that she gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. They failed to tell her the home had been moved over 300 kilometres from its original building site. In so doing, it is alleged by the plaintiff that they breached the terms of the PCDS.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property.

I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 1.

She had no idea that the property was being sold. She simply wanted to see what property of this value would look like. She did not have the means to do so.  4) There was no discussion about home inspection. The evidence indicated that the realtor had not been properly trained in the construction of the house and that the husband had misrepresented certain facts to the plaintiff. The husband had been in the plumbing and heating business for more than 35 years and had no particular expertise or knowledge about construction. The wife had no interest in purchasing a house and was not able to afford one. She wanted to buy one that would not require extensive renovations or repairs and that would be good for 50 years.  5) The husband was not a party to the action. He was hired as a consultant. He did not provide the wife with a copy of the building permit.  6) The wife did not want to buy a house that was not within her means. She felt that she could not realistically afford to buy it.

Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed. Conclusion 176) While Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski are liable for breach of contract, each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to Ms. Schira, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87. 1. Ms. Schira shall have judgment against the defendants in the amount of $49,608.87.",0.4274809160305344,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a home in 1998. She engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and her company fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also alleges aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress.  1) The house did not meet the plaintiff’s expectations. The property was too expensive for the plaintiff to afford. She was unable to obtain a mortgage on it. 2) The realtor and her husband were liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the parties. 3) The plaintiff did not know that the house had been moved, nor was she aware that the rural municipality did not do any inspections of moved or newly constructed residences. She had no idea that the property was being sold. She simply wanted to see what property of this value would look like. She did not have the means to do so.  4) There was no discussion about home inspection. The evidence indicated that the realtor had not been properly trained in the construction of the house and that the husband had misrepresented certain facts to the plaintiff. The husband had been in the plumbing and heating business for more than 35 years and had no particular expertise or knowledge about construction. The wife had no interest in purchasing a house and was not able to afford one. She wanted to buy one that would not require extensive renovations or repairs and that would be good for 50 years.  5) The husband was not a party to the action. He was hired as a consultant. He did not provide the wife with a copy of the building permit.  6) The wife did not want to buy a house that was not within her means. She felt that she could not realistically afford to buy it. She sued the husband for damages against him and his company.  7) The court found that the wife was entitled to damages against both parties for negligence and for misrepresentation.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home.

An order that any further amounts due and owing from SPMC to the company be paid into court to be disposed as directed by the court was granted with taxed costs to SPMC.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent is a wholly independent institution of post-secondary education which manages, administers and controls its property, revenue, business and affairs through its Board of Governors and administration department. 2)There is no evidence of governmental control that could be regarded as an exercise of government power sufficient to bring the respondent within the application of the charter. In cases involving arrests, detentions, searches and the like, to apply the Charter to purely private action would be tantamount to setting up an alternative tort system. In the area of private discrimination, an entirely new system of civil liability in competition with the dispute resolution mechanisms of the Canadian Human Rights Act would be established. 3)The applicant's contention that this creates the degree of government control to warrant the application is untenable. The applicant is only bringing employees who are not in the public service within the definitions required to be under that pension plan and such 'deeming' is only for the purposes of that Act.

The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it.

2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. This was an application wherein the respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousa support. The petitioner did not have the means to make the indicated payments. The respondent was 52 years old and was unemployed. He was diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder. In the past he had been diagnosed as being of sound mind and able to manage his own affairs. In any event, in 1987 he qualified for disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provided his basic income of $580.00 a month.

e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused are how his actions ought to be characterized. 1) The accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault. It is legally irrelevant whose shanks caused which injuries. 2) The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The Court held that an assault may be made by a person doing, or omitting to do, acts for the purpose of aiding a principal to commit an offence; and 3) self-defence is not available to the accused. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants. The terms 'aiding' and 'abetting' have similar meanings. To “aid” under s. 21(1)(b) means to assist or help the actor. The requirement of an objective analysis ensures that the criminal law encourages reasonable and responsible behaviour.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008. [33] I will next deal with the argument that Knife’s actions against Dorion were done in self‑defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. [63] Accordingly, I conclude that the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted, within the meaning of the law, and that, even if he did hold this belief, which I find not to be the case, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Nonetheless, I reject both the subjective and objective components of the second prong of the test for the same reasons that I rejected the first prong of the test. However, as I stated previously, I do not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, Knife reasonably believed that Dorion had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate.

It is obvious from the video recordings that Knife was armed with a shank, whereas Demeria was not, and that stabbing Demeria and holding him so that he could not get away, as Dreaver and Knife were doing, was far more force than was necessary to enable him to defend himself.
